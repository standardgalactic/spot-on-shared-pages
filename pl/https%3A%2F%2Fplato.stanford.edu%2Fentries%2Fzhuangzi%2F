<h1>Zhuangzi</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Dec 17, 2014; substantive revision Sun Mar 24, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Zhuangzi (Chuang-tzu &#33674;&#23376; &ldquo;Master Zhuang&rdquo; late
4th century BC) is the pivotal figure in Classical Philosophical
Daoism. The <em>Zhuangzi</em> is a compilation of his and
others&rsquo; writings at the pinnacle of the philosophically subtle
Classical period in China (5th&ndash;3rd century BC). The period was
marked by humanist and naturalist reflections on normativity shaped by
the metaphor of a <em>d&agrave;o</em> (&#36947;)&mdash;a social or a
natural <em>path</em>. Traditional orthodoxy understood Zhuangzi as an
anti-rational, credulous follower of a mystical Laozi. That
traditional view dominated mainstream readings of the text. Recent
archaeological discoveries have largely laid that ancient orthodoxy to
rest.</p>

<p>
Six centuries later, elements of Zhuangzi&rsquo;s naturalism, along
with themes found in the text attributed to Laozi helped shape Chan
Buddhism (Japanese Zen)&mdash;a distinctively Chinese, naturalist
blend of Daoism and Buddhism with its emphasis on focused engagement
in our everyday ways of life.</p>

<p>
This wide range of views of Zhuangzi stem from the style of the text.
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s prose style is its own distinctive literary treasure.
The central feature is the parable, typified as a discussion between
imaginary or real interlocutors. Typically short, pithy, and amusing,
his tales are both accessible and philosophically seductive&mdash;they
both entertain and make you think. A respite from the dry moralizing
of Confucians, the text was always a favorite of the Chinese
intellectual, literati class. The <em>Zhuangzi</em> also attracts
modern Western readers with its thoroughgoing naturalism,
philosophical subtlety, and sophisticated humor, all set in a
strikingly different conceptual scheme and its distant, exotic
context.</p>

<p>
Philosophically, Zhuangzi strikes us as more the Hume of his tradition
than a system builder like Plato, Aristotle, or Kant. He drew
skeptical and relativist implications from his naturalist approach to
normative guidance. His treatment of natural <em>d&agrave;o</em>s
focused on the norms governing correct use of language. His ethical
relativism grew out of his indexical understanding of the norms of
word use.</p>

<p>
This indexical linguistic approach focused on the key evaluative terms
used in choosing among natural paths of behavior
(<em>d&agrave;o</em>s), &#26159;&#38750; <em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em>
<em>this-not that</em>. These normative terms also guide language use,
the choices of words, and the objects words pick out as topics.
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s foils were credulous and dogmatic Confucian
humanists, particularly the innate intuitionist absolutism of a type
familiar from the <em>Mencius</em>. He also took his linguistic
insights to undermine Mozi&rsquo;s pragmatic utilitarian alternative
to Confucianism. He engaged seriously with later Mohist, realist,
linguistic theories, both acknowledging their challenge to primitive
quietism (the anti-language view familiar in <em>The Laozi</em>) and
yet remaining skeptical of the realist conclusion. His most frequent
co-discussant in the text was Hui Shi, a rival linguistic
relativist.</p>

<p>
The following topics highlight some central interpretive
controversies. The bulk of the article proposes a philosophical
interpretation that both fits the <em>Zhuangzi</em> into the classical
philosophical dialogue and explains his modern relevance.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="ZhuaLifeTime">1. Zhuangzi&rsquo;s Life and Times</h2>

<p>
Zhuangzi flourished through the latter half of the fourth century BC,
roughly contemporary with Mencius and with the &ldquo;linguistic
turn&rdquo; in the classical period that included the later Mohists
and the figures historians later labeled as the School of Names
(&#21517;&#23478; <em>ming-jia</em>). Zhuangzi demonstrates mastery of
this Classical Chinese terminology of pragmatics and semantics and
makes his own theoretical contributions to ancient Chinese theory of
language. The traditionally recognized figures in this school included
Gongsun Longzi along with Hui Shi&mdash;Zhuangzi&rsquo;s close friend,
perhaps mentor, his interlocutor, and occasionally his foil. Zhuangzi
is followed in this mature phase of Classical linguistic thought by
some chapters in the later Confucian text, <em>The Xunzi</em>. Though
<em>The Xunzi</em> elsewhere targets Zhuangzi for criticism, his
sections incorporating and developing this linguistic turn embellish
the linguistic theory shared between the later Mohists and
Zhuangzi.</p>

<p>
Most of what we infer about Zhuangzi&rsquo;s life, we draw from
evidence within the <em>Zhuangzi</em>, although the Han biographers
did speculate about his place of origin (the state of Meng), his
personal name (Zhou), and the official posts he held (minor posts in
Qiyuan, his home state) and period he lived (during the reign of
Prince Wei over Chu&mdash;which ended about 327 BC). Scholars have
found it hard to confirm any details of his life from outside this
text and from his being discussed by later thinkers. The text itself
contains scattered stories about Zhuangzi, but given its frequent use
of fantasy, even these we must season with the salt of textual
skepticism. We attribute a large chunk of the extant text of the
<em>Zhuangzi</em> to &ldquo;students of Zhuangzi&rdquo; but we have
little hint of who his students were or if he even had students in any
formal sense.</p>

<h2 id="EvolTextTheo">2. Evolving Text Theory</h2>

<p>
Guo Xiang (d. 312 CE), a scholar working around 600 years later after
the fall of the Han, edited and reduced what he saw as a haphazardly
accumulated cluster of apocryphal and possibly authentic texts. He
concluded that many were added after the time Zhuangzi lived. Guo
reports compressing that prior collection of writings from fifty-two
chapters to thirty-three. This is the extant text on which our
knowledge is based. Guo divided the chapters he had chosen into three
sections: the &ldquo;Inner Chapters&rdquo; (1&ndash;7), the
&ldquo;Outer Chapters&rdquo; (8&ndash;22) and the &ldquo;Miscellaneous
Chapters&rdquo; (23&ndash;33). He attributed only the first section to
the period dating from Zhuangzi&rsquo;s lifetime&mdash;hence possibly
originating from Zhuangzi&rsquo;s teachings. The second grouping may
have included writings of a &ldquo;School of Zhuangzi&rdquo;. Modern
scholarship assigns various sources of other influences found in both
the second &ldquo;outer&rdquo; and final &ldquo;miscellaneous&rdquo;
chapters. A.C. Graham, drawing on work of the Chinese theorist, Kuan
Feng (Graham 1979), and followed with some variation by Liu Xiaogan
(Liu 1994) and Harold Roth (Roth 1991, 2003), divides these influences
into roughly four variously named groups:</p>

<ul>

<li>Zhuangzi&rsquo;s students or the School of Zhuangzi credited with
those later writings committed most closely to the views expressed in
the &ldquo;inner chapters&rdquo;.</li>

<li>Authors with egoist views associated with Yang Zhu (4th century
BC). The <em>Mencius</em> presented Yang&rsquo;s thought as a version
of an ethical egoism that rejected conventional altruistic social
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s.</li>

<li>The third group Graham dubbed the &ldquo;primitivists&rdquo;.
Primitivists share Yang Zhu&rsquo;s antipathy to social, historical or
conventional <em>d&agrave;o</em>s&mdash;typically those supporting
social norms extending beyond agricultural village life&mdash;in favor
of more natural ways. This group shares attitudes with the text of the
<em>Laozi</em> (<em>D&agrave;od&eacute; Jing</em>) mixed with Yangist
themes.</li>

<li>The final group, dominated the &ldquo;miscellaneous&rdquo;
sections, Graham called them syncretists (eclectics) who seemingly
attempted comprehensiveness by combining all points of view into a
single complete <em>d&agrave;o</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
However widely assumed, Zhuangzi&rsquo;s direct responsibility for any
of the &ldquo;inner&rdquo; chapters remains a hypothesis, subject to
skeptical doubts (Klein 2010). Guo&rsquo;s original assessment that
Zhuangzi did not author any of the remaining sections remains
conventional scholarly wisdom. When we attribute something to
Zhuangzi, we are attributing it <em>to the text</em> and, where
relevant, to the &ldquo;Inner Chapters&rdquo;, particularly Ch. 2.</p>

<p>
Combining the different elements into a single volume reflects a
familiar Classical pattern of embellishing the teachings of a
<em>zi</em> (master), adapting the additions to the namesake&rsquo;s
writing style and expanding on his themes and insights in distinctive
ways. The four schools contributing to the extant text shared an
emphasis on natural&mdash;as opposed to
social-cultural&mdash;<em>d&agrave;o</em>s. Yangism or egoism rejected
social or moral <em>d&agrave;o</em>s on the apparent assumption that
natural guiding <em>d&agrave;o</em>s recommend self-preserving
behavior. Its paradigm is the anti-social hermit. Yangists treat
motivation by self-interest as normatively prior to conventional
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s. They preserved their natural purity from social
corruption by rejecting society&rsquo;s conventional mores.</p>

<p>
Primitivism similarly rejected social and conventional
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s (mores), but has its own conception of natural,
pre-social, typically intuitive, ways of life that supports rustic,
agricultural, small village existence. It inspires populist and
anarchist political tendencies. Syncretism does not reject social
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s <em>per se but</em> does reject any particular
<em>d&agrave;o</em> as biased and narrow in contrast to a more,
&ldquo;rounded&rdquo;, idealized, or comprehensive
<em>d&agrave;o</em>. This is often expressed in an ideal observer form
(the sage, perfect human, or nature:sky (&#22825; <em>tian</em>)
<em>d&agrave;o</em>). These views tend toward epistemic
supernaturalism&mdash;claims to cognitive access to some
transcendently correct <em>d&agrave;o</em> not available to ordinary
people. Both syncretism and primitivism also tend to deny that their
transcendent <em>d&agrave;os</em> can be explained in language
form.</p>

<p>
The discussions in the &ldquo;Inner Chapters&rdquo;, particularly in
the second chapter, by contrast, treat both language and
social-conventional <em>d&agrave;o</em>s as natural
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s of natural creatures. This undermines Primitivist
and Yangist contrast of natural vs. conventional, nurtured
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s. Humans are naturally social animals and enact
natural causal processes when they walk or talk&mdash;or write and
exchange money for vegetables. Human social practices leave marks in
nature, (like a trail or a text) which become physically accessible to
later <em>walkers</em> as history (stored in memory, legend, writings,
or footprints etc.). These tracks or traces guide others by supplying
them with opportunities to use their know-how.</p>

<p>
The pivotal second chapter draws relativist and skeptical conclusions
from its normative naturalism. It rejects the traditionalism of
Confucianism and the implicit Gaia-hypothesis in Mozi&rsquo;s attempt
to recruit <em>ti&#257;n</em> (&#22825; sky:nature) as an authority
recommending utilitarian social <em>dao</em>s. Nature provides us with
many ways to behave, but does not judge or care which choices we make
among those naturally possible. <em>Sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em>
(&#26159;&#38750; this (way)/not-that) judgments are made by living
creatures in nature, not by <em>ti&#257;n</em> itself. We can find
guiding structures, <em>d&agrave;o</em>s, <strong>in</strong> nature
but not a favored or dictated <em>d&agrave;o</em> <strong>of</strong>
nature.</p>

<p>
Like the &ldquo;Miscellaneous Chapters&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Inner
Chapters&rdquo; Zhuangists accept that social <em>d&agrave;o</em>s are
continuous with natural ones, but they do not endorse any imagined or
alleged, comprehensive judgments from the cosmos, from all-natural
points of view. The cosmic judgment from nowhere is a non-judgment.
Zhuangists are not committed to Laozi&rsquo;s exclusive distinction of
natural (<em>ti&#257;n</em>) vs. social (&#20154; <em>ren</em>
&ldquo;human&rdquo;) d&agrave;os. They are skeptical of claims to have
special access to context-free, guiding know-how by alleged or
self-styled &ldquo;sages&rdquo;, &ldquo;ideal observers&rdquo;, or
perfect exemplars of epistemic virtues. Ziporyn (2012) interpretively
treats allusions to transcendently perfect guidance or know-how as
&ldquo;ironic&rdquo;. Moeller (2022), Moeller and D&rsquo;Ambrosio
(2017), D&rsquo;Ambrosio (2020a) see poking fun at such pretense as
the point of Zhuangzi&rsquo;s formulating these passages. Zhuangists
both accept language and accept our natural capacity and inclination
to toy with it, alter it, and mould it to our use in various
situations of practical choice.</p>

<p>
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s exemplars are butchers, musicians, cicada catchers,
wheelmakers&mdash;exemplars of mundane and focused behavior guidance.
Each is an exemplar of one of the many ways of life
(<em>d&agrave;o</em>s). They execute their particular specialties in a
highly cultivated, precise, and smooth manner with ease and a sense of
flow. The imagined eclectic synthesis of all the numerous ways of life
into some total-comprehensive <em>d&agrave;o</em> is no more than
<em>de facto</em> restatement of their co-existence in a single
natural world as optional ways of life. The cosmos makes no judgment
that they should exist&mdash;though it combines them into a cosmic
<em>d&agrave;o</em> that is the history of everything. That the cosmos
has this outcome does not mean it makes a human-like choice which
humans could or should execute. We are ill advised to strive for such
skill at <em>everything</em>.</p>

<p>
The eclectics were the last community working with the text, adding to
it and carrying it into later periods. The Laozi had become enmeshed
with a ruler cult worship of The Yellow Emperor. Laozi became the far
more influential figure during the Confucian orthodoxy of the Han
(206&ndash;220 BC).</p>

<h2 id="CompInteNarr">3. Competing Interpretive Narratives</h2>

<p>
The wide range of views of Zhuangzi stem from the style of the text
and the ways it has figured in China&rsquo;s intellectual history as
well as the ways it was caught up in the interaction between China and
the modern, scientific West.</p>

<p>
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s style is the philosophical parable, typically a brief
discussion or exchange between two points of view. There is slight
plurality of humans among the discussants joined by natural and
imaginary creatures. Its fictional characters are usually cleverly
named; some are Confucian icons (Confucius or his alleged teacher, Lao
Dan). Some discussants are animals (real and fictional fish, birds,
snakes), a talking skull, the wind, musicians, debaters, tigers,
trainers, butchers, butterflies, burglars, and the myriad other
&ldquo;pipes of nature&rdquo;. Expressive brevity and subtlety of
detail enhance the impact of the often complex and elusive point of
the parables&mdash;they seldom explicitly formulate the moral or point
explicitly. Most commonly, the author(s) end discussions in a doubting
tone, a double rhetorical question, or some pithy enigmatic parting
shot. They may make their point by having the two parties walking away
shaking their heads, agreeing only to disagree; both appreciating that
they barely understand one another, and yet feeling that something has
been learned from the exchange.</p>

<p>
Translation into Western languages invites biases that are hard to
avoid. The main effect is loss of the conceptual cohesion of the
original, but the parables still engage our Western philosophical
curiosity. We get the exhilaration of immersion in an independent
philosophical tradition of comparable antiquity and richness. Readers
in and out of China invariably suspect that the
<em>Zhuangzi</em>&rsquo;s appealing style is infused with
philosophical genius, even as they disagree about its philosophical
upshot. Indeed, much of the <em>Zhuangzi</em>&rsquo;s philosophical
appeal may stem from its deliberate open-ended texture, the
interpretive malleability of its dialogues which invites, even perhaps
requires, us to join the author(s) in their philosophical
reflection.</p>

<p>
This appeal stems only partly from the quality and sophistication of
his episodes, each illuminating a patch of philosophical territory
ending with a question for further pondering&mdash;like Nietzsche or
the Later Wittgenstein. Each exchange presents or illustrates shards
of insight with open-textured conclusions&mdash;all laced with
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s obvious joy in exploring deep divergence in point of
view&mdash;particularly on linguistic matters. Each is a natural, but
difficult to access, alternative way of life. The frequent enigmatic
conclusions &ldquo;the answer is <em>X</em>&rdquo; leaves interpreters
arguing centuries later, Fermat-like, how <em>X</em> can be an
answer&mdash;or what <em>X</em> is (e.g., &ldquo;free and easy
wandering&rdquo;, &ldquo;walking two paths&rdquo;, &ldquo;goblet
words&rdquo;, &ldquo;clarity&rdquo;, and so forth). Each seems to fit
easily into a range of puzzles familiar to thinkers in both Chinese
and Western traditions. One suspects that we find the correct
interpretation by finding our way, like Wittgenstein&rsquo;s fly, out
of some philosophical bottle. Solving the philosophical conundrum
gives one the correct interpretation of Zhuangzi.</p>

<p>
The religious view of Zhuangzi starts a century after Zhuangzi lived
(4th century BC). (See
 <a href="../daoism-religion/">Religious Daoism</a>.)
 Philosophical schools were closed, books burned and thought repressed
during the superstitious Qin dynasty (221&ndash;206 BC) which followed
the classical period. This initiated China&rsquo;s philosophical
&ldquo;Dark Age&rdquo;. The more orthodox Confucian Han Dynasty (206
BC to 220) followed. Over two decades (109&ndash;91 BC) the Han
emperor&rsquo;s hereditary Grand Historians, Sima Tan and Sima Qian (a
father and son team), wrote an official history from the mythical
Yellow Emperor (c. 3rd Millennium BC) to the Han. The Simas&rsquo;
intellectual history fabricated four &ldquo;schools&rdquo; (&#23478;
<em>ji&#257;</em> families) to cluster groups of Classical thinkers
who focused on certain concepts. The concepts were <em>d&agrave;o</em>
(paths), <em>f&#462;</em> (&#27861; performance:standards [a.k.a.
&ldquo;Legalist&rdquo;]), <em>m&iacute;ng</em> (&#21517; names) and
Yin-Yang. Counting the various schools of Confucianism and Mohism as
two, this classification reduced the &ldquo;hundred schools&rdquo; of
the period to six.</p>

<p>
As the name suggests, the &ldquo;<em>schools</em>&rdquo; (&#23478;
<em>ji&#257;</em> family, home) began as something more like
&ldquo;in-house&rdquo; <em>zi</em> (master)-apprentice arrangements
where the <em>ji&agrave;o</em> (&#25945; teachings) were crafts,
skills, and arts. Learning was mastering a method to be exercised
<em>well</em> in a context. A central skill for Confucius, the first
<em>zi</em> (master), was reading, writing, and speaking effectively
in social-political roles. Confucius&rsquo;s students launched the
practice of teaching and learning from the &ldquo;master&rsquo;s
book&rdquo;. Mohist schools followed, with students constructing
several versions of Master-Mo&rsquo;s teachings and the practice of
reading, copying, editing, and even updating a master&rsquo;s text
became the mechanism for the Classical evolution of thought&mdash;the
spread and competition of <em>teachings</em>
(<em>ji&agrave;o</em>).</p>

<p>
Drawing on this insight, Graham (1989) demurred from the traditional
Laozi-as-master, Zhuangzi-as-student reading. Writing that
&ldquo;[Zhuangzi] never knew he was a [Daoist]&rdquo;, Graham averred
that &ldquo;Inner Chapters&rdquo; Zhuangzi had neither met Laozi nor
knew of the <em>Daode Jing</em> text. He speculated that the
traditional affiliation stems from the &ldquo;Outer Chapters&rdquo;.
There, Zhuangzi&rsquo;s students created clever dialogues between a
mythical Lao Dan (a.k.a. Laozi), teacher of Confucius. As teacher, he
who could &ldquo;speak down&rdquo; to Confucius. The overlap of tropes
and thematics suggests some communication between those students of
Zhuangzi and the anonymous compilers of the still evolving <em>Classic
of D&agrave;o and D&eacute;</em> (&#24503;
&ldquo;virtuosity&rdquo;).</p>

<p>
A cult of Huang-Lao, worshipping the Yellow Emperor and Laozi as joint
divinities of the ruling <em>f&#462;ji&#257;</em>
(&ldquo;Legalist&rdquo;) cult, had grown up to dominate the Qin
empire. The father and son Han historians were also students of
Huang-Lao masters. At the fall of the Han the narrative of Zhuangzi as
a follower/elaborator of a semi-divine Laozi was well entrenched, but
<em>the Zhuangzi</em> was neglected by those enamored by the
superstitions of Imperial Confucianism. The <em>Huainanzi</em> (Liu An
179&ndash;122 BC) was the chief evidence of continuing interest in
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s philosophy.</p>

<p>
The post-Han resurgence, known as Neo-Daoism, began with the editing
of the received edition of, first, the <em>Laozi</em> (Wang Bi
226&ndash;249) tying his text closely to the popular divination text
with Confucian commentaries, the <em>Yi Jing</em> or <em>Book of
Changes</em>. A generation later, a scholar of the same school of
&ldquo;Dark Learning&rdquo;, Guo Xiang (d. 312 CE) produced the
received version (see above) of <em>the Zhuangzi</em> (described
above)&mdash;perhaps with heavy borrowing from one of the &ldquo;Seven
Sages of the Bamboo Grove&rdquo;, Xiang Xiu (3<sup>rd</sup> C.).</p>

<p>
Although the Xiang-Guo Zhuangzi recognized that Zhuangzi&rsquo;s
relativist realism differed from Laozi&rsquo;s anti-language
naturalism, the disagreement was taken to be confined to degrees of
emphasis within Daoism&mdash;now conceived as a single school of
thought. The metaphysical formulations made the difference seem like a
chicken vs. egg issue, &ldquo;which came first, being or
non-being?&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Neo-Daoist discussion practices around this metaphysical issue were
influential in bringing Buddhist and Chinese thought into interaction
with the Chinese conceptual scheme, and Daoism became enmeshed with
Buddhism in the popular view (especially Chinese Chan&mdash;Japanese
Zen&mdash;Buddhism). The <em>being-non-being</em> format easily
coalesced with Buddhist worries about the reality of Nirvana vs.
Samsara, self vs. Buddha-nature. A Daoist institutional
&ldquo;religion&rdquo;, borrowing models of monasteries, monks, and
nuns from Buddhism, influenced the discourse about Daoism throughout
the period of Buddhist domination of the Chinese intellectual world
(achieved gradually during the Six Dynasties period 220&ndash;589 and
extending through the Tang 618&ndash;907). Neo-Confucians from the
medieval period on treated Buddhism and Daoism as essentially similar
religions.</p>

<h2 id="ModePhilInte">4. Modern Philosophical Interpretations</h2>

<p>
Modern philosophical theory concerning the Zhuangzi grows from two
recent discoveries.</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:decimal">

<li>The reconstruction of the Later Mohist dialectical works and</li>

<li>Archaeological reconstructions of the text of the <em>Daode
Jing</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The following section discusses their twin impact on our view of
Zhuangzi.</p>

<p>
Developments at the end of the nineteenth and early twentieth century
in China led Chinese intellectuals to adopt the European concept of
philosophy (&#21746;&#23416;) with its implicit distinction from
religion. This distinction was seen as pivoting on logic&mdash;the
theory of proof or argument. They started to segregate their own
writings which seemed most like argument, inference, and logic, from
those sustained solely by credulity and tradition. They began to sort
out the philosophical aspects of their traditional thought from its
more religious and superstitious elements. Sun Yirang&rsquo;s
(1848&ndash;1908) 1897 reconstruction of the Mohist Canon (Sun 1965)
provided convincing evidence that rigorously analytic discourse about
linguistics had emerged from the context of normative social-political
theory disputes in Classical China. This example encouraged nineteenth
century intellectuals like Yan Fu (1854&ndash;1921) and Liang Qichao
(1873&ndash;1929) to see Classical thought as philosophical. They
started to emphasize the ancient schools which, along with the Mohist
analytic linguists, otherwise recognized the norms of Western
philosophy. Many others, notably Hu Shih (1891&ndash;1962) and Jin
Yuelin (1895&ndash;1984) continued this tradition of reconceiving and
re-centering Chinese thought away from the Confucian scholasticism
that had dominated since the Han.</p>

<p>
This early twentieth century logic-inspired reformation eventually
influenced the interpretation of especially the <em>Zhuangzi</em> and
the <em>Xunzi</em>. In the west, this was largely inspired by Angus
Graham who had observed that both ancient texts demonstrated a mastery
of the technical vocabulary of Mohist linguistic theory.</p>

<p>
Western philosophical appreciation of the <em>Zhuangzi</em> stems from
Graham&rsquo;s 1969 &ldquo;[Zhuangzi]&rsquo;s Essay on Seeing Things
as Equal&rdquo; (Graham 1969, predating his work on Mohism). Wryly
replying to speculation that Shen Dao, not Zhuangzi, had authored the
beloved chapter, Graham allowed that whoever wrote that
philosophically rich text is the person we should think of as
Zhuangzi. Graham proposed looking at the text&rsquo;s seemingly
conflicting thoughts as analogous to the &ldquo;inner dialogue&rdquo;
of a reflective thinker who formulates a view, considers it, then
rejects it. After his monumental work reconstructing and interpreting
the
 <a href="../mohist-canons/">Later Mohists</a>,
 Graham began to emphasize how much <em>the Zhuangzi</em> and <em>the
Xunzi</em> demonstrated engagement with Mohist theory of language. He
stressed their apparent mastery of the technical language of Mohist
theory and of the advanced issues they were debating.</p>

<p>
Graham&rsquo;s textual arguments were indirectly supported by
archaeological discoveries of different <em>Laozi</em> texts. The
discoveries in the early 1970s and 1990s together implied a later date
for the emergence of the <em>Laozi</em> text. The exact timeline
remains unclear, but gives us no reason to doubt Graham&rsquo;s
suggestion that Zhuangzi did not know of the text.</p>

<p>
When we abandon the traditional identification of Zhuangzi as disciple
of Laozi, it opens the door for speculation about his relation to the
relativist, linguistic theorist, Hui Shi, traditionally treated as
belonging to the School of Names. Christoph Harbesmeier speculated he
may have been either Zhuangzi&rsquo;s teacher, mentor, or fellow
student. If he was a teacher, he came to accept his student as an
equal or even as superior in the art of linguistic normativity. The
<em>Zhuangzi</em> portrays him as playing a role in the development of
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s philosophical skill. He is repeatedly portrayed as an
intimate interlocutor and eventually as a foil for sharpening
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s philosophical analysis. Among those texts that
concentrate on <em>m&iacute;ng</em> (&#21517; names), Hui Shi&rsquo;s
ten theses mark his as a relativist response to Mohist realism about
the relation of names and &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;&mdash;focusing
particularly on comparative physical terms like &ldquo;large&rdquo;
and &ldquo;tall&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
We can read Zhuangzi&rsquo;s relativism accordingly, as an
alternative, more reflectively subtle, <em>indexical</em> relativism
(what a term refers to depends on the <em>indexed</em> location of the
speaker in space and time) about <em>right and wrong</em>
(<em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em> &#26159;&#38750; this-not that)
judgments regarding choices and <em>walkings</em>
(<em>x&iacute;ng</em> &#34892; walking:behavior) of paths
(<em>d&agrave;o</em>s). Language was a <em>d&agrave;o</em> of using
<em>names</em> (words) as shared guideposts. This can explain both
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s more sophisticated relativism in theory of language
and his recognition of valid Mohist (realist) refutations of Hui
Shi&rsquo;s version of <em>name</em> (<em>m&iacute;ng</em> &#21517;
names) relativism. Between the traditional &ldquo;Daoist&rdquo; and
the analytic philosophical interpretation lies a provocative range of
recent interpretive views. There are even views that emphasize
&ldquo;religiosity&rdquo; around the philosophical interpretive
elements: naturalism, oneness, and liberation (Shang 2006).
Comparative treatments of this range are themes in several of the
articles in the &ldquo;Further Readings&rdquo; section of the
 <a href="#Bib">bibliography</a>
 below. This article develops and expands on Graham&rsquo;s
philosophical interpretation and emphasizes the relation to Hui Shi
and the Later Mohists rather than to the <em>Laozi</em>.</p>

<h3 id="BackDispAbouSociNormDaos">4.1 The Background Dispute about Social Normative Daos</h3>

<p>
Confucian <em>d&agrave;o</em>s were broadly humanist. The earliest
version (Confucius 551&ndash;479 BC) traced normativity to earlier
human invention. Metaphorical trails (<em>d&agrave;o</em>s) are
enshrined in social practices emerging from past human
<em>x&iacute;ng</em> (&#34892; walking: behaviors). Language was an
example of such an emergent social practice which intertwined with
conventional practices (rituals) to yield the &ldquo;sage-king&rdquo;
inspired way of life&mdash;&#20154; <em>r&eacute;n</em> (human)
&#36947; <em>d&agrave;o</em> (path). Named status-roles and ritualized
learned practices for the role players was the fabric of his
<em>d&agrave;o</em>. A later version (Mencius 372&ndash;239 BC)
focused on natural <em>human</em> psychology as
<em>r&eacute;nd&agrave;o</em>. The correct path is that to which our
natural moral psychology inclines us. Humans have a <em>x&#299;n</em>
(&#24515; heart-mind) that is naturally <em>shan</em> (&#21892;
good-at) choosing and interpreting <em>d&agrave;o</em>s.</p>

<p>
Mencius was reacting to Mohism. Mozi (470&ndash;391 BC) initiated a
shift in focus to more natural and objective, less culturally relative
Ways of grounding normative language, statuses, and social
practices&mdash;utility. He argued that <em>ti&#257;n</em>
(nature:sky) &ldquo;favored&rdquo; courses that lead to general human
well-being. So humans should use that natural norm, the
<em>bi&agrave;n</em> (&#36783; distinction) between
<em>l&igrave;-h&agrave;i</em> (&#21033;&#23475; benefit-harm), in
constructing our social <em>d&agrave;o</em>, including the norms of
language.</p>

<p>
Mozi&rsquo;s version of &ldquo;rectifying names&rdquo; (correctly
using terms) is using them to mark the optimific structure of
cooperative social practices&mdash;a utilitarian social
<em>d&agrave;o</em> (path) (Fraser 2016; Hansen 1989). He grounded
normative authority in <em>ti&#257;n</em> rather than the sage kings
by attributing a <em>will</em> to nature. Nature <em>intends</em> us
to follow its structures in ways that lead to universal human
<em>well-being</em> (<em>l&igrave;</em> &#21033; benefit). Ethical
questions thus have a single correct answer in an ideally engineered
and shared normative linguistic practice. Mozi&rsquo;s utilitarian
metaethics began the turn to natural realism, but it remained
human-centered and instrumentalist in his early formulations. The
 <a href="../mohist-canons/#PhilLang">Mohist Canons</a>,
 however, backed away from instrumentalism on the familiar realist
grounds that the most efficient and effective way to use words is to
mark real distinctions between thing-kinds that are accessible to
ordinary folk&rsquo;s &ldquo;eyes and ears&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Daoist primitivism (represented by the mythical Laozi and the
anonymous text known as the <em>D&agrave;od&eacute; Jing</em>) was, as
noted above, a further trend toward a broader ethical naturalism, but
with anti-language, absolutist implications. We should forget or
ignore all social norms and practices, including linguistic ones.
Utility (perhaps egoistic utility) does motivate our behavior as
naturally as water follows the paths created by natural contours of
earth. Language should not interfere in any way with this natural
guiding interaction between us and the open course(es) of nature.</p>

<h3 id="ConcFociChinDaoiNormTheo">4.2 The Conceptual Foci of Chinese Daoist Normative Theorizing</h3>

<p>
Understanding the <em>Zhuangzi</em> is made more difficult by the huge
differences not only in the philosophical context, but also in the
pervasive metaphors that structure and focus discussions of norms of
behavior in the Chinese vs Indo-European classical traditions. His
positions invite comparisons with modern metaethical naturalism but he
does not focus those positions using concepts linked to grammatical
sentences such as &ldquo;laws&rdquo; or &ldquo;rules&rdquo; (sentences
in <em>all</em> form) or &ldquo;facts&rdquo; (sentence-sized chunks of
reality) or &ldquo;properties&rdquo; (realities corresponding to
sentence predicates).</p>

<p>
Zhuangzi used Confucius&rsquo;s and Mozi&rsquo;s metaphor,
<em>d&agrave;o</em>. Choosing and interpreting a social
<em>d&agrave;o</em> shaped Chinese discussions of pragmatic knowing,
of knowing <em>how</em> and<em>knowing to</em>, the components of
knowing <em>d&agrave;o</em> and having <em>virtuosity</em> (&#24503;
<em>d&eacute;</em>)<em>s</em>. <em>D&agrave;o</em>s can be social or
natural structures that facilitate and guide us in a sequence of
actions that constitute the
<em>behavior</em>&mdash;(<em>x&iacute;ng</em> &#34892; walking). We
learn and practice the behaviors and the achievement is
<em>know-how</em> (<em>zh&#299;d&agrave;o</em> &#30693;&#36947;
knowing), aware and practice-adapted behavior. Knowing-to is timing
and context sensitivity to execute the learned behavior. (Mencius, by
contrast, opined that context sensitive <em>knowing-to</em> is
innate). We find minimal normative linguistic focus on an internal
(<em>de dicto</em>) <em>belief</em> state connected to sentences
(knowing-that). Learning is physiological.</p>

<p>
<em>D&agrave;o</em>s answer practical questions: what to do or how to
do it. As the core of warring Chinese conceptions of guidance,
<em>d&agrave;o</em> guidance has phases. The metaphorical structure of
the character &#24503; (<em>d&eacute;</em> virtuosity) reflects this
3-way relation: the left part the path we walk (notice
<em>virtuosity</em> and <em>walk</em> share the left-side semantic
marker), the right part consists of the graph for an eye
(&#30446;<em>m&uacute;</em>) and the heart (&#24515;
<em>x&#299;n</em>). We first find or notice <em>paths</em>, then
choose <em>this</em> path over <em>that</em> (&#26159;&#38750;
<em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em> this-not that, right-wrong) and then
translate or interpret the selected <em>d&agrave;o</em> to guide our
<em>behavior</em> (<em>x&iacute;ng</em> &#34892; walking: behavior,
conduct).</p>

<p>
Confucian <em>d&agrave;o</em>s, <em>rituals</em> (<em>l&#464;</em>
&#31150; propriety, custom, manners, courtesy), were tied to named
social roles. Learning and practice usually involved the authority of
a teacher who had earlier acquired <em>virtuosity</em>
(<em>d&eacute;</em> &#24503; excellence, virtue) at that role. This
chain of authority stretched back to the sage kings, but could be
acquired via a short-cut, an intuitive <em>d&eacute;</em> called
<em>humanity</em> (<em>r&eacute;n</em> &#20161; charity, humans acting
in pairs, reciprocal-altruism). Presumably, that intuition explains
how the sage-king originators of the <em>named behavior</em> acquired
it and began the chain of transmission.</p>

<p>
Confucius rarely emphasized the <em>choice</em> phase of the path
metaphor complex (Fingarette 1972). The rival Mohists add the
pragmatic terms &#26159;&#38750; (<em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em>
this-not that) and &#36783; (<em>bi&agrave;n</em> distinction). These
are pivotal for Zhuangzi and presumably deliberately avoided by the
anonymous authors of the <em>Laozi</em>. To use a word, we acquire a
capacity, come to know-how to <em>bi&agrave;n</em> (distinguish):</p>

<ul>

<li>that word from other words, and</li>

<li>some part of the world (<em>sh&igrave;</em> this:right) from the
other parts that are <em>f&#275;i</em> (not-that: wrong).</li>
</ul>

<p>
A <em>way</em> of using the word may be <em>permissible</em>
(<em>k&#283;</em> &#21487; permissible, possible) or not.</p>

<p>
This cluster of concepts related to the path metaphor was used to
shape questions the West would phrase in terms of moral propositions,
laws, or principles. Knowing <em>how</em> to use a word in guidance is
what constitutes understanding language. Ziporyn (2013) draws further
attention to Zhuangzi&rsquo;s occasional use of another path-like
concept, <em>lane</em> (<em>l&#464;</em> &#29702; principle,
tendency). Translators most typically render it
&ldquo;principle&rdquo;. Zhuangzi and his contemporary Mencius treat
<em>l&#464;</em> (lane) as a kind of internal path that, Ziporyn
argues, <em>coheres</em> with outer <em>d&agrave;o</em>s of
possibility. This vaguely physical coherence evokes the constructive
interference of waves. It is less a formula than a &ldquo;know it when
you hear it&rdquo; realization that your performance
<em>resonates</em>. Some things (and people) are suited to following
certain <em>d&agrave;o</em>s by their internal resonant structure,
their <em>l&#464;</em>. Combined with learning and practice,
<em>l&#464;</em> can overlap with <em>d&eacute;</em>, the degree of
virtuosity we can acquire at <em>performing</em> (<em>x&iacute;ng</em>
walking) the behaviors to fit the situation.</p>

<p>
Both Mohists and Confucians tended to focus more on social
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s and on a narrow concern with human life expressed
in their treating <em>benevolence</em> (<em>r&eacute;n</em> &#20161;
concern for other-humans) as the single important <em>lane</em>
leading to <em>virtuosity</em> (<em>d&eacute;</em> virtue,
excellence). Mohists advocated guiding reform of conventional social
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s using a natural normative <em>distinction</em>
(&#36783; <em>bi&agrave;n</em>) of <em>benefit-harm</em>
(&#21033;&#23475; <em>l&igrave;-h&agrave;i</em>). For Mohists,
<em>benefit-harm</em> was a <em>natural</em> (&#22825;
<em>ti&#257;n</em>) <em>way</em> of finding, choosing, reforming and
interpreting social <em>d&agrave;o</em>s. In contrast to Confucians,
Mohists sought to elaborate their <em>natural ways</em> of selecting
<em>d&agrave;o</em>-like social practices as operational, objective,
measurement-like <em>standards</em> (<em>f&#462;</em> &#27861; law,
principle) accessible to ordinary humans&rsquo; &ldquo;eyes and
ears&rdquo; and minimally subject to prior training and
indoctrination.</p>

<p>
Chinese linguistic analysis fits naturally into similar
language&mdash;it concerns ways of using words. The more
philosophically inclined schools began to see those norms of word-use
as underlying the disagreements among schools about which social
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s to follow and how to follow them. The Mohists
couched their discussion of norms of use in <em>choice</em>
formulations such as &ldquo;choose&rdquo; (&#21462; <em>q&#468;</em>),
&ldquo;pick out&rdquo; (&#33289; <em>j&#468;</em>),
&ldquo;assertible:admissible&rdquo; (&#21487; <em>k&#283;</em>) ,
&ldquo;distinction&rdquo; (&#36783; <em>bi&agrave;n</em>),
&ldquo;point&rdquo; (&#25351; <em>zh&#464;</em>), and
&ldquo;combine&rdquo; (&#21512;<em>h&eacute;</em>). The core
psychological attitude is <em>w<em>&eacute;</em>i</em> (&#28858;
deem:do) which may be expressed as a tendency (in speech, both inner
and expressed) to express a <em>right-wrong</em>
(<em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em> &#26159;&#38750; this-not that) judgment
about how to use a word. <em>To call</em> (<em>w&egrave;i</em>
&#35586; <em>call it</em>) is both phonetically and semantically
related. Behaviorally, both describe dealing with something as
socially labeled with the <em>name</em>. Conversely, we can
<em>sh&igrave;</em> or <em>f&#275;i</em> the use of a name of some
contextual object&mdash;<em>w&egrave;i</em> (call) or
<em>w&eacute;i</em> (deem) it properly associated with that
<em>name</em> (<em>m&iacute;ng</em> &#21517; term, word).</p>

<p>
To <em>deem-as</em> (<em>w&eacute;i</em> &#28858; act-on) can be
either to express the category assignment in one&rsquo;s
behavior&mdash;either speech-behavior or behaving toward the object as
people would be expected to, given that they assigned the object to
that category. The behavior for the category would be found in the
social or natural <em>d&agrave;o</em> (path) they follow. A
<em>deeming-as</em> (<em>w&eacute;i</em> &#28858; act-on) state is
less a mental picture of a fact (a belief) than a disposition to treat
or identify some object as deserving the <em>name</em>. Instead of the
western reality vs. appearance dialectic, Chinese discussion revolves
around the contrast of natural (<em>ti&#257;n</em> nature:sky)
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s and human (<em>r&eacute;n</em>) or socially
constructed, <em>d&agrave;o</em>s. The human <em>d&agrave;o</em>s are
constructed with the help of <em>names</em> (<em>m&iacute;ng</em>)
strung together into <em>language</em> (&#35328;
<em>y&aacute;n</em>).</p>

<p>
Mozi, as we noted above, appealed to what he regarded as a natural
utility <em>standard</em> to judge the acceptability of
<em>language</em> (<em>y&aacute;n</em>) use and Confucius relied more
on past usage ranging back to the mythical sage kings. Mozi had noted
the obvious arbitrariness of justifying word usage relying on
self-referential indexicals (e.g., this is the way <em>we</em> speak)
(<em>Analects</em> 13:19) in justifying his standard of language
reform. This led Mencius to appeal to a <em>cultivated</em>,
<em>innate seed</em> of universal <em>human moral intuition</em>
(<em>r&eacute;n</em> &#20161;). Since <em>cultivation</em> typically
included learning and practicing conformity to existing social
practice, the <em>Zhuangzi</em> (2:4) rejected Mencius&rsquo; way out
of the problem. The <em>x&#299;n</em> (&#24515; heart (guiding
organ)), he argued, matures with the body and typically acquires its
inclinations to <em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em> (this-not that) along the
way. Each way of shaping the psychological and physical dispositions
to behavior, each actual personal history, is as natural as the
others. Nature (<em>ti&#257;n</em>) <em>per se</em> is not a normative
authority. Norms are <em>d&agrave;o</em>s that are <em>in</em> nature,
but we do not follow &ldquo;The <em>D&agrave;o</em>&rdquo; <em>of</em>
nature. When we make a normative <em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em>
(this-not that) judgment, we depend on one of many local parts of
natural <em>d&agrave;o structure of possible options for our
behavior.</em></p>

<p>
In effect, life <em>emerges</em> in nature along with its
<em>d&agrave;o</em>. Normativity, guided choice, emerges naturally
among some living things and their <em>daos</em> emerge within
life&rsquo;s <em>d&agrave;o</em>. Morality emerges among <em>some</em>
normative <em>d&agrave;o</em>s&mdash;among some living creatures. By
contrast, the craft&ndash;inspired Mohists tried to get direct answers
from <em>ti&#257;n</em> (sky-nature) using operational measurement
tools which &ldquo;let nature decide&rdquo; the judgment. This natural
realism is the most formidable alternative to Zhuangzi&rsquo;s
contextually relativist way of understanding norms of word use.</p>

<p>
Normative <em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em> (&#26159;&#38750; this-not
that) judgments can concern choice of a <em>d&agrave;o</em> or the
interpretive performances of a given <em>d&agrave;o</em>. Alternately,
both normative issues may be <em>k&#283;</em> (&#21487;
assertible:permissible) or not. The <em>d&agrave;o</em>s, possible
guides to behavior, may be natural or social&mdash;including,
pivotally, <em>d&agrave;o</em>s of language use. First order
disagreement could be addressed by appealing to second-order
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s of choosing or interpreting, e.g., Mozi&rsquo;s
utilitarianism.</p>

<h3 id="ZhuaDistAppr">4.3 Zhuangzi&rsquo;s Distinctive Approach</h3>

<p>
Zhuangzi conforms to the general pre-Han model, using a path metaphor
to discuss normativity in general. This fuels the traditional view of
him as a Daoist, but he differs from Laozi in blurring the bright line
of distinction the Laoists drew between natural and social
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 6:1). Zhuangzi portrays
natural and social <em>d&agrave;o</em>s as deeply entangled processes
which emerge from the processes of <em>life</em>
(<em>ti&#257;nxi&agrave;</em> the world of living things). Human
social <em>d&agrave;o</em>s are one among the many natural behaviors
of natural animals. Human language emerges from processes in nature
along with birds tweeting and frogs croaking.</p>

<p>
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s departure from Confucian, Mohist, and primitivist
perspectives grounds a more complex view of the structure of natural
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s which shapes his rejection of the Mencian
&ldquo;<em>heart</em> as <em>ruler</em>&rdquo; model of path
choice/interpretation decisions. Humans interact in real contexts to
construct ways of behavior. We dispute about many details by issuing
<em>judgments</em> (<em>sh&igrave;f&#275;i</em> this/not-that) that
&ldquo;endure like agreements or covenants&rdquo;. This web of past
commitments builds up as we pass through life hemming us in as we age
and our capacity to learn afresh declines. We see things through a web
of past commitments (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 2:2).</p>

<p>
What looked like a natural teleology to Mozi was the emergence of
<em>many</em> natural kinds which find their different ways in the web
of natural <em>d&agrave;o</em> without a natural guiding authority. A
species design emerges as natural <em>capacities</em>
(<em>d&eacute;</em> virtuosity) for exploiting their possibilities.
Humans are among these kinds and with our debates and emergent
structure of <em>judgments</em> (<em>sh&igrave;f&#275;i</em>) we
coordinate to exploit our possibilities with a language.</p>

<p>
Since languages, like species, emerge from a natural process of
adapting to possibilities, how can we say some are and some not
authentic?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
How can <em>d&agrave;o</em>s be hidden such that some are
<em>authentic</em> (<em>zh&#275;n</em> &#30495; real, true) and others
<em>artificial</em> (<em>w&#283;i</em> &#20605; deceptive, false)?
(<em>Zhuangzi</em> 2:4&ndash;5)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Mencius and Mozi give rival higher level accounts of why their
proposed social <em>d&agrave;o</em>s are <em>authentic.</em>
Mencius&rsquo; response to Mozi&rsquo;s natural teleology was also
speciesist. Ti&#257;n supplies humans with a guiding organ, the
<em>heart</em> (<em>x&#299;n</em> &#24515; heart-mind, mind) as a
naturally authorized <em>ruler</em>. Zhuangzi replies <em>nature</em>
supplies us with:</p>

<p>
A hundred joints, nine openings, six viscera all present and complete
in me. Is one more related to me than another? Aren&rsquo;t we pleased
with them all? Do we have a selfish part in them? Is it to have the
rest as ministers and concubines? Are its ministers and concubines
incapable of cooperative rule? They take turns as each other&rsquo;s
ruler and minister. Is there an authentic (<em>zh&#275;n</em>
&#30495;) ruler? (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 2:3)</p>

<p>
When we <em>walk</em> the paths in real time, we <em>realize</em>
(<em>r&aacute;n</em> &#28982; thus, real, true) some of the
<em>possibilities</em> (<em>k&#283;</em> &#21487; possible,
permissible) the path affords. &ldquo;<em>D&agrave;o</em>s are
<em>realized</em> by walking them&rdquo;. (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 2:6)
Human social <em>d&agrave;o</em>s become map-like aids in finding and
choosing behaviors. Our knowledge of <em>d&agrave;o</em>s is
indexical. We learned how, acquired our <em>virtuosity</em>
(<em>d&eacute;</em>), through practice and know-to <em>realize
this</em> behavior <em>here now.</em> We have constructed human ways
of following nature&rsquo;s paths of opportunity. We construct them by
our past praxis, but we can also learn from other natural animals.
They similarly construct natural <em>d&agrave;o</em>s which become
available for human finding, choosing, and walking.</p>

<p>
Zhuangzi uses the notion of <em>dependence</em> (<em>y&#299;n</em>
&#22240; dependent, relative) to discuss this complexity in the
structure of natural guidance. When we choose a course of conduct, we
implicitly rely on some map as our guide to, our <em>d&agrave;o</em>
of choosing among, available paths. We know how to flip a coin; we
consult a desire; we construct a spreadsheet of pros and cons; or we
simply continue with some past praxis. Any time we choose a way to go
in life, the choosing itself exercises a learned
behavior&mdash;perhaps by our ancestors or teachers.</p>

<p>
Our choices sit atop a complex structure of prior choices by ourselves
and others. This illuminates Zhuangzi&rsquo;s quip that humans
interact in <em>d&agrave;o</em>s as fish interact in water
(<em>Zhuangzi</em> 6:6). We are surrounded and dependent on a complex
natural and human structure of <em>possibilities</em>
(<em>k&#283;</em> &#21487;). Zhuangzi hints that the implicit regress
of ways of choosing ways <em>might</em> terminate at <em>some</em>
point&mdash;or not. We are unlikely, given our limited life spans, to
reach such a terminus (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 3:1 &amp; 11:3).</p>

<p>
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s discussion, particularly in the philosophically most
sophisticated second chapter, is mainly about the plurality and
relativity of this vast web of iterative mesh of <em>d&agrave;o</em>s,
natural and social of <em>d&agrave;o</em>s and <em>d&agrave;o</em>s of
those <em>d&agrave;o</em>s, and so on. His skepticism, thus, about
anyone&rsquo;s knowing the <em>moral</em> (<em>y&igrave;</em> &#32681;
appropriate, right) choice is not nihilism (that there is no best or
right choice). It is natural fallibility since we can only pursue the
issue so far given our limited lifetimes.</p>

<p>
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s argument against Mencius&rsquo; intuition did not
imply that intuition is <em>not a</em> way of choosing. It is a
second-level choice so we implicitly <em>depend on</em> a third level
way of choosing second ways of choosing when we act on intuition.
Zhuangzi follows Song Xing and Laozi in the <em>Zhuangzi&rsquo;s</em>
history of thought (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 33:3 and Confucius
<em>Analects</em> 2:4). All note that our heart&rsquo;s intuitions
reflect our past training and practice commitments. This is enough for
Zhuangzi not to rely on them when considering Mozi&rsquo;s proposed
moral reform. Mozi argued nature wants us to consider utility as a way
of choosing moral convention reform. We don&rsquo;t get a
this/not-that <em>judgment</em> without implicitly depending on some
prior <em>judgment behavior.</em></p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Having a <em>sh&igrave;-fei</em> in the heart without it having
already been constructed there is like going to Yue today and arriving
yesterday. (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 2:4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Zhuangzi naturalizes <em>d&agrave;o</em>s less by attending to natural
physical guiding structures (e.g., Laozi&rsquo;s <em>d&agrave;o</em>s
of water) than to the diverse ways of animal life. Each is natural yet
different from how humans find and follow <em>d&agrave;o</em>s. All
depend on their different natural organs which coordinate in following
a path. Eyes take in its shape; hearts react with motivating moods and
attitudes and legs and feet carry us forward. Like other animals, we
similarly coordinate with others, but our social <em>d&agrave;os</em>
<em>mature differently and commit to different trajectories</em>. All
of our different societies coordinate in pursuing human
<em>d&agrave;o</em>. This complexity of natural ways of interaction
fuels, in turn, both Zhuangzi&rsquo;s skepticism of absolutes, of
authority, of ideal observers, and of social dogmas. His mildly
qualified advice is to let each thing work out for itself,
&#33258;&#28982; (<em>z&igrave;r&aacute;n</em> self-real-ize), how to
find, choose and exploit opportunities in their particular
environments as they interact.</p>

<p>
The other distinctive feature of Zhuangzi&rsquo;s approach lies in his
extension of this complex relativist orientation to discussing
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s of language. These are social
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s that are akin to a map&rsquo;s legend. They add
further complexity and dependence. Again, this is not to reject them,
as much as to remind us of the plethora of possibilities. Graham
interpreted a famous Zhuangzi trope (the pipes of <em>ti&#257;n</em>
[&#22825; nature:sky]) as Zhuangzi&rsquo;s way of positioning language
as <em>ti&#257;n</em> (natural) sound. And like social
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s, all of them are natural.</p>

<blockquote id="pipesoftianquote">

<p>
The pipes of earth, these are the hollows everywhere; the pipes of
men, these are rows of tubes. Tell me about the pipes of Heaven. Who
is it that blows the ten thousand differences, makes them their own,
all of them self-chosen? What stirs these processes?
(<em>Zhuangzi</em> 2:1)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Graham elaborates:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
These are apparently the holes in the heart through which thought
courses and the mouths which utter it, so that the breath blown by
heaven through the inner formations of different men issues in
contradictory utterances. (Graham 1969:149; Ziporyn 2009 surveys five
other interpretations)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Zhuangzi thus removes <em>ti&#257;n</em> from the role of ultimate
normative authority&mdash;the role it plays in both Mozi&rsquo;s and
Mencius&rsquo;s side in the dispute. <em>Ti&#257;n</em> cannot settle
their dispute since it &ldquo;blows equally out of both&rdquo;. All
social <em>d&agrave;o</em>s that are actually available as choices are
equally <em>ti&#257;n</em> (natural). <em>Ti&#257;n</em> (nature)
generates <em>d&agrave;o</em>s as it generates the <em>w&ugrave;</em>
(&#29289; thing-kinds (humans and other animals)) that find and follow
them. The cosmos is the playground on which things interact, not the
authority that tells them how to act. We self-realize
(<em>z&igrave;r&aacute;n</em>) one in the network of naturally
possible <em>d&agrave;o</em>s. <em>D&agrave;o</em>s are chosen from
the menu found in nature, but none is nature&rsquo;s choice for
us&mdash;none of the <em>d&agrave;o</em>s in nature is
<strong>the</strong> <em>d&agrave;o</em> <strong>of</strong>
nature.</p>

<p>
Dialectically, Zhuangzi&rsquo;s replacement for
<em>ti&#257;n</em>&rsquo;s role as source of normative guidance would
be one of many second-level <em>d&agrave;o</em>s of choice and skilled
performance actually possible for us <em>here, now</em>. He situates
us at indexed points in this cosmic network of paths forward from
<em>here and now</em> to there in the future.</p>

<p>
The philosophical advantage of Zhuangzi&rsquo;s way of discussing
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s, thus, does not leave him suggesting that what is
natural is moral (analogous to implying &ldquo;ought&rdquo; from
&ldquo;is&rdquo;). Nature gives us a complex three-dimensional network
with levels of guiding structures in which we humans are left to
navigate (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 6:6).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Greater knowing is calm and comprehensive; smaller knowing is cramped
and contentious. Greater language ignites insight; smaller language
dims and diminishes. We sleep and interact with ghosts; Waking we
start up our bodies. In interacting, we construct; our guiding-organs
contend. We start simply then complexities arise and get more
entangled. Our lesser anxieties motivate us, the greater anxieties
paralyze us. Like a mechanical bow, we spit out directions,
&ldquo;This! Not that! (<em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em>)&rdquo; The ones
that dominate lie embedded like sworn oaths as we continue on to our
deaths which approach like fall and winter. Gradually we disappear,
sink below the surface. We cannot recover the dynamism with which we
began to construct the cords which, in our feeble old-age, bring our
guiding-organ near death with no way back to its original creativity.
(<em>Zhuangzi</em> 2:2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This metaphorically florid description of the existential worry about
the point of our existence reflects the &ldquo;we&rdquo; orientation
of Classical Chinese conceptions of normativity. The issue of
knowing-how and guiding with language replaces the belief-knowledge,
appearance-reality dynamics in the West. We participate in a social
unit as it constructs its <em>d&agrave;os</em>. We contend with each
other using our own heart-mind&mdash;the organ along with the eye that
interacts with natural paths. As our commitments to past agreed norms
or directions accumulate, the social guidance in language becomes
complex and constricting. The resulting inflexibility in our
individual and social old age is symbolic of our intellectual death,
our loss of the ability to find and follow new ways.</p>

<p>
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s narrative turns to the individual processes of
choosing a direction.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Attitudinal states&mdash;happiness, anger, sorrow, delight; concern,
admiration, perplexity, resolve; attraction, absorption, excitement,
familiarity&mdash;arise in turn, like music from hollows, mushrooms
from the damp; they confront us day and night, Yet, there is no
knowing how to interpret them. Still, never mind. They&rsquo;re there
constantly; they come from somewhere. (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 2:2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We don&rsquo;t know what role these states play but they seem central
to our choosing activity&mdash;indeed, in a twist on Buddhism and
Hume, without their role in our choosing, we would not have an indexed
perspective, an &lsquo;I&rsquo;. (The narrator had introduced the
above
 &ldquo;<a href="#pipesoftianquote">pipes of heaven</a>&rdquo;
 metaphor to describe a gestalt he describes as having &ldquo;said
farewell to my <em>w&#466;</em> (I:me)&rdquo;.) All guidance is from a
point, an index in the cosmic network of paths for things. The paths
are available to different parts of the cosmos, emergent
objects&mdash;physical or living, plants or animals, birds, humans,
snakes. Like other animals, our paths are entangled with each
others&rsquo;. Individuals are parts of the cosmos, and of their
families, clubs, linguistic communities, political units, etc. which
are also parts of the cosmos with <em>d&agrave;o</em>s in the cosmos.
Each part has its inner processes of seeking, deciding on, and
carrying out some of the <em>d&agrave;o</em>s that lead from node to
node. As each part performs one of its <em>d&agrave;o</em>s, the
structure of <em>d&agrave;o</em>s changes. Things emerge and
disappear.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We can walk the paths we&rsquo;ve been guided to but still see no sign
of their endorsement by authority. We light on paths and react with
heart-mind responses. That&rsquo;s it. Are all lives as pointless as
this? Or only mine? (<em>Zhuangzi 2:3</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Appeal to the guiding organ&rsquo;s (&#24515; <em>x&#299;n</em>
heart-mind) inclinations faces the same problem as appeal to nature.
All hearts are natural&mdash;the sage&rsquo;s as well as the
fool&rsquo;s. Our bodies and our guiding organs both change as we
pursue a trajectory through our lives (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 2:3). The
shape that is <em>constructed</em> (&#25104; <em>ch&eacute;ng</em>) by
life is implicated in all the decisions we go on to make. Any output
from our <em>constructed</em> guiding organ will be a product of our
having walked one of a range of possible <em>d&agrave;o</em>s to this
point.</p>

<p>
When we view Zhuangzi&rsquo;s skeptical relativism in the context of
his path, learning, and know-how conceptual space, we can see it as
metaphorically more like Einstein&rsquo;s physical relativism than
cultural relativism about truth. We choose and enact
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s from a moving frame of reference constructed or
matured (&#25104; <em>ch&eacute;ng</em>) from past commitments. Our
heart-minds reach a point with a frame of reference&mdash;at speed on
a path. Our point of view, our perspective, comes complete with prior
<em>commitments</em> to <em>d&agrave;o</em>s (ways) of appreciating
and selecting among available paths.</p>

<p>
Mozi&rsquo;s and Mencius&rsquo; second-level <em>d&agrave;o</em>s for
choosing and <em>walking d&agrave;o</em>-like opportunities can
themselves be chosen and <em>walked</em> correctly or incorrectly.
Choosing an epistemic <em>d&agrave;o</em>, similarly, depends on other
practically available <em>d&agrave;o</em>s for guiding that
meta-choice&hellip; and so on. Zhuangzi does not view these as
rational or logical constructions, but as complicated, multi-layered
natural possibilities. Our languages are unlike mere natural sounds in
that they have a scheme of concepts, but any such scheme that in fact
emerges in a community <em>of natural beings</em> is a natural one.
How we deploy the scheme in real-world behavior is neither fixed nor
given. <em>D&agrave;o</em>s of interpretation are both natural and
socially constructed. We regard constructions that work for us in some
situations as <em>zh&#275;n</em> (natural/authentic) and those on
which we can elaborate at some length as &ldquo;this&rdquo; (&#26159;
<em>sh&igrave;</em> right) and its rivals as &ldquo;not-that&rdquo;
(<em>Zhuangzi</em> 2:4).</p>

<p>
Zhuangzi postulates no homunculus exercising authority over the
organs, joints, openings in the body. So, what does the choosing?
Despite the earlier linking of choosing to the mysterious moods,
Zhuangzi focuses less on the conscious subjective experience of our
mental substance or cognitive self and more on the indexical locus of
the body in space-time. The I:me (&#25105; <em>w&#466;</em>) is
analogous to the &ldquo;this&rdquo; and &ldquo;that&rdquo; within the
linguistic <em>d&agrave;o</em> structure&mdash;the grammatical
indexical marks a choosing point in the conceptual
<strong>and</strong> space-time structure. Like Hume&rsquo;s self,
without the naturally occurring grab-bag of emotional attitudes, it
would not be there to play its choosing role. But it is the whole
body, not just those attitudes, that chooses my way of behavior. The
<em>w&#466;</em> (I:me) is situated in a multi-layered frame of
reference with its own complicated <em>ch&eacute;ng</em> (&#25104;
commitments)&mdash;swimming along in sea of <em>d&agrave;o</em>s
available for its choice.</p>

<p>
Humans are the parts of the natural cosmos that engage in extensive
teaching and learning of behaviors with a language. The
<em>w&#466;</em> (I:me) that has learned and knows-how is situated in
existing commitments embedded in an indexed here-now in the network of
ways to which is has and will assign <em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em>
(this-not that). Each <em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em> (this-not that) it
&ldquo;shoots out&rdquo; further commits it to a path. The first level
paths have a shape, but the <em>d&agrave;o</em>s of correct choice and
performance are acquired by learning and lodged inside the
performer&rsquo;s body and not always plainly visible.</p>

<p>
The trend from Confucius&rsquo;s socially constructed humanism toward
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s naturalism had been gradual. Mozi&rsquo;s argument
for basing such constructions on a natural distinction of universal
benefit and harm was an early step. Mencius developed both his
response to Mozi and his account of the role of <em>r&eacute;n</em>
(&#20161; benevolence) as arguments that Confucian ritual behavior had
evolved from natural (<em>ti&#257;n</em>) intuitive response patterns
in the heart (&#24515; <em>x&#299;n</em>). Mencius&rsquo; answer to
Mozi drew on Yang Zhu&rsquo;s naturalism. Mencius portrayed his other
dialectical rival as a normative egoist. Graham credits Yang with the
primitivist notion of an inborn <em>x&iacute;ng</em> (&#24615;
bio-nature) which is a normative &ldquo;gift: endowment&rdquo; from
<em>ti&#257;n</em> (sky-nature). Thus, all three postulated a
<em>natural</em> (<em>ti&#257;n</em>) normative authority. Three
choices, egoism, utilitarianism, and intuition were the rival
second-level sources of <em>natural</em> (<em>ti&#257;n</em>)
guidance. The target of this choice was Mozi&rsquo;s social
construction of morality.</p>

<h3 id="IntuIllu">4.4 Intuitionism and Illumination</h3>

<p>
Zhuangzi views the paradigm normative debate in Classical
China&mdash;the <em>r&uacute;-m&ograve;</em> (Confucian-Mohist)
dispute&mdash;through his lens of epistemic dependence
(<em>y&#299;n</em>). We face all choices with a prior, <em>fixed</em>
(<em>ch&eacute;ng</em>) commitment to <em>d&agrave;o</em>s, to guiding
perspectives. He introduces his perspective on perspectives thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Where can <em>d&agrave;o</em> (guides) hide such that there are
genuine and artificial? Where can <em>y&aacute;n</em> (&#35328;
language) hide such that there is <em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em>
(&#26159;&#38750; this-not that)? Where can <em>d&agrave;o</em>s hide
such that they do not exist? How can a <em>y&aacute;n</em> (&#35328;
language) exist and not be <em>k&#283;</em> (&#21487; assertible)?
<em>D&agrave;o</em>s hide behind small achievements and language hides
behind rhetorical flourishes and elaboration. So, you have the
&ldquo;<em>sh&igrave;</em> (this) <em>f&#275;i</em> (not that)&rdquo;
of the Confucians and Mohists. Of what one says &ldquo;this&rdquo; the
other says &ldquo;not that&rdquo; and of what the other says
&ldquo;not that&rdquo; the first says &ldquo;this&rdquo;. If you want
to &ldquo;not that&rdquo; what the other &ldquo;this&rsquo;s&rdquo;
and &ldquo;this&rdquo; what the other &ldquo;not that&rsquo;s&rdquo;,
nothing beats <em>m&iacute;ng</em> (&#26126; illumination).
(<em>Zhuangzi</em> 2:4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This passage and its conclusion have fueled a lively interpretive
debate around three positions: absolutism (one, perhaps mystical
<em>way</em>), nihilism (no <em>way</em>), and pluralistic relativism
(several <em>ways</em>). Zhuangzi&rsquo;s enigmatic conclusion and the
interpretation of his recommendation to use <em>m&iacute;ng</em>
(&#26126; illumination) is only part of the issue.</p>

<p>
The first concern is whether one should even engage in normative
<em>this, not that</em> (<em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em> right-wrong)
discourse. There are many versions of a negative answer. Most mirror
the posture of the Primitivists&mdash;exemplified by Shen Dao and
Laozi. It amounts to a first order &ldquo;natural&rdquo; norm that we
should not make <em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em> (this-not that)
judgments&mdash;period. It follows immediately, we shouldn&rsquo;t
engage in disputes about <em>how</em> to make them (Graham 1989). A
second version allows making them, but avers that no dispute can be
settled. So, although we <em>may</em> engage, doing so is futile (Lai
&amp; Chiu 2014).</p>

<p>
Another variation assumes ethical egoism and sees engaging in
normative disputes as personally costly by upsetting one&rsquo;s
equilibrium (Kjellberg 1994; Raphals 1994). A sibling social point of
view is that such disputes disrupt <em>social</em> equilibrium (Walker
2022; Lai &amp; Chiu 2014; Coutinho 2015). Perhaps engaging in
<em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em> disputes bespeaks an unseemly obsession
with being right (Wong 2005). Or, in the extreme, anything that
results from engaging in a dispute is wrong or self-contradictory
(Coutinho 2015 and Graham 1989). These anti-discursive attitudes fund
the nihilistic (&ldquo;there is no way to know right from
wrong&rdquo;) interpretation of <em>m&iacute;ng</em>.</p>

<p>
These lines of defeatist interpretation of <em>m&iacute;ng</em> are
helped along by some engaging slogans and metaphors which Zhuangzi
uses in various places: fasting the mind (Fraser 2014b), wandering
without aim (Fraser 2014a), &ldquo;goblet&rdquo; language spilling
over (Chiu 2015). Each slogan is made reasonable in the contexts of
the parable in which it occurs: a dangerous diplomatic mission to an
unstable tyrant, skilled artists engaged in complex performances,
puzzles made worse by thinking in ruts. Zhuangzi is particularly known
for his attention to know-how (skill-knowledge). The smooth exercise
of a complex acquired skill may be hindered by rehearsing coaching
slogans. Zhuangzi also advocates open-mindedness and creativity, urges
us to find alternative <em>d&agrave;o</em> solutions which may require
letting go of or rethinking commitments (Lai 2022b). Avoiding some
commitments can increase options&mdash;but motivating the strategy
<em>depends on</em> a commitment to access to more options. Fraser
contrasts &ldquo;instrumental&rdquo; and &ldquo;moderate&rdquo;
interpretations in context with mystical (Yearly 1983), absolutist, or
nihilist/Stoic (Coutinho 2015) versions of Zhuangzi&rsquo;s views on
discursive behavior.</p>

<p>
The philosophical objection to this familiar emphasis on the defeatist
slogans is the <em>Zhuangzi</em>&rsquo;s (Ch. 33) repudiation of Shen
Dao&rsquo;s fatalist posture with the familiar, anti-discursive, stoic
result. The absolutist, intuitive anti-discursive stance clashes with
the extended argument (above) against &ldquo;you
gentlemen&rsquo;s&rdquo; intuition&mdash;the idea that a natural,
neutral immediate judgment exists that does not depend on some
acquired, <em>ch&eacute;ng</em> (constructed) <em>d&agrave;o</em> of
judgment.</p>

<p>
Talk of Daoist intuition here is befuddled by a
translation-interpretation confusion concerning of the Chinese term
&#36783; <em>bi&agrave;n</em> (distinction/dispute). It and the
Western notion of an <em>argument</em> are ambiguous, but the
ambiguities overlap at only the &ldquo;dispute&rdquo; end.
&ldquo;Argument&rdquo; is ambiguous between <em>quarrel</em> and
sentences arranged in valid <em>proof</em> structures. &#36783;
<em>Bi&agrave;n</em> (distinction) is ambiguous between
<em>quarrel</em> and making distinctions, the &ldquo;this, not
that&rdquo; choice of <em>way</em> of <em>walking here, now</em>.</p>

<p>
Although the Later Mohists had started reflecting on matters that
might eventually have led them to formulate the concept of sentences
arranged in a valid <em>argument</em> structure, they were not close.
Their central notion of justification was that of a standard which
could yield the correct discrimination&mdash;the Mohist &#27861;
<em>f&#462;</em> (measurement standard). Zhuangzi was interested in
language but in neither syntax nor logical form. He doesn&rsquo;t
reject Western rationalism, but neither does he promote it. For
Chinese philosophers, intuition was not the second level
<em>opposite</em> of logic. It was immediate judgment without appeal
to any other second level way of deciding and interpreting (e.g.,
flipping a coin, measurement operation).</p>

<p>
The Mohists, however, had one important logic-like result&mdash;the
rejection of self-condemning judgments&mdash;of which Shen Dao&rsquo;s
<em>f&#275;i</em>-ing of either <em>f&#275;i</em>-ing <em>or</em>
s<em>h&igrave;</em>-ing is a paradigm. Any judgment condemning all
judgment is perverse. The problem with these general anti-discursive
strategies is not that they are illogical <em>in Western terms</em>,
but that <em>they were known to be defective in China</em> by anyone
versed in the Later Mohist dialectic&mdash;as we&rsquo;re assuming
Zhuangzi to be. These anti-discursive <em>general</em> strategies do
not play well with Graham&rsquo;s insight that Zhuangzi has mastered
the Later Mohists&rsquo; technical language and theory and that he
<em>successfully</em> constructs an alternative theory of
language.</p>

<p>
Another strategy suggests Zhuangzi engages in discussions only for
entertainment&mdash;toying with words (Moeller &amp; D&rsquo;Ambrosio
2017), speaking ironically (Ziporyn 2012; Walker 2019) and parodying
the position he seems to espouse. Some characters in Zhuangzi&rsquo;s
dialogues wonder about exceptional figures who allegedly have
abilities that justify that posture&mdash;the capacity to transcend
our location in points of view and to lecture all of us from a
privileged perspective. The <em>Zhuangzi</em>&rsquo;s response
typically reminds them that such idealized points of view are neither
intelligible to us nor relevant to what <em>we, ordinary types</em>,
should do. Either these exceptional observers have their own naturally
<em>ch&eacute;ng</em> (fixed) frames of reference in the natural
world, or they are outside of the natural world in some
unrealistically <em>unbounded</em> realm. If the latter, then their
views are both unintelligible and irrelevant to natural beings. What
they would do in our situation does not constitute helpful advice
<em>to us</em>. To advocate following the advice of these ideal
observers is to speak practical nonsense to non-ideal, actual
actors.</p>

<p>
In the discussion of skepticism, Zhuangzi&rsquo;s spokesman says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&ldquo;So, you don&rsquo;t know what is beneficial or harmful, does
the &lsquo;fully arrived human&rsquo; necessarily not know
them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Kingsley replied, &ldquo;the fully arrived person becomes pure
sapience, he could be in a blazing forest and not be able to feel any
heat, the rivers of our civilization could freeze and he
couldn&rsquo;t feel any chill, devastating lighting could pulverize
mountains and the wind raise a tidal wave and he could not experience
surprise. Someone like that could ride on clouds and air, straddle the
sun and moon, and wander beyond the four oceans. Death and life are
not different for him, much less the inclinations of benefit and
harm&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Master Ju Que asked master Zhang Wu, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard from my
teacher that a sagely man does not find social dealings worth
engaging, doesn&rsquo;t pursue utility, doesn&rsquo;t avoid harm,
doesn&rsquo;t take delight in striving, doesn&rsquo;t follow
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s; in silence, he says things and in saying things,
is silent. He roams outside the nitty-gritty of the actual world.
Master regarded this as romantic fantasy but I deem it the execution
of a mysterious <em>d&agrave;o</em>. My kind sir what do you say of
this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Zhang Wu replied, &ldquo;This is something that, were the Yellow
Emperor to hear, it would be like buzzing, and so how could the likes
of Confucius come to know it? Furthermore, you have jumped to
conclusions&hellip;. I&rsquo;ll give you some absurd talk and you
absurdly listen&rdquo;. (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 2:11&ndash;12)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As Ziporyn notes, one may read these passages ironically or
mystically. Zhuangzi looks to be parodying the idea of a wordless
intuition or of guidance from an absolute, cosmic, or transcendent
<em>d&agrave;o</em>. &ldquo;Where can I find a man who has forgotten
language so I can talk with him&rdquo; (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 26:13). We
will revisit the second theme below; in either reading, it practically
amounts to not taking passages rejecting discursive activity as
expressing Zhuangzi&rsquo;s serious, <em>general, philosophy of
language, decision, know-how and behavior</em>.</p>

<p>
Both rivals in the Confucian-Mohist dispute would have accepted the
existence of a correct answer&mdash;either the distinction made by the
higher ranked intuition (the educated or intuitive gentleman or sage)
or that obtained by operating measurement-like total-utility standard.
Neither would have found the <em>debate process itself</em> as tending
toward the right result (as a Western rationalist would). Mozi comes
closer, suggesting no one can resist his measurement-based language
(Mozi 12a:18) and his analysis of the Confucian second level standard
as self-defeating (Mozi 4c:4). For the intuitionist, the issue boils
down to whose immediate, intuitive judgment is superior; for the
Mohist, it is that a measurement-like operation would settle the
matter, not the words expressed in dispute.</p>

<p>
Note that their dispute pivots on their second level <em>way</em> of
choosing a first level social behavior, e.g., the Confucian elaborate
burial and three years of mourning. Zhuangzi&rsquo;s insight that the
heart&rsquo;s <em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em>s depend on one of many
prior, naturally constructed or learned perspectives, illuminates why
the dispute persists. If we measured utility, the answer would have
been obvious. The Confucian, however, with their cultivated moral
attitude about elaborate funerals and three-year mourning period, sees
the Mohist appeal to &ldquo;gain&rdquo; as morally callous and
insensitive to their moral role. The very idea of thinking
mathematically about the funeral of your grandfather!! If we decided
by our existing instinctive or cultivated normative attitudes, the
answer would be equally obvious.</p>

<p>
This awareness of the many ways of choosing and interpreting is the
alternative <em>constructive</em> candidate for <em>m&iacute;ng</em>
(&#26126; illumination). There are many second level standards and our
choice among them is as complex as our original choice of first level
behaviors. If there were a single naturally possible one, the dispute
would not persist. Zhuangzi explicitly rejects intuition&mdash;as
biased, imperfect, and only one among many ways to choose
<em>this</em> and <em>not-that</em>. A cultivated (and even innate)
intuition needn&rsquo;t be ruled out. Nor does he reject utilitarian
measurement. He rarely uses the character &#27861; <em>f&#462;</em>
(measurement-standards), but when he does, it is coherent with Mohist
use. The <em>Zhuangzi</em> history recapitulates the common objection
that Mohists measure material well-being but discount the value of
music (entertainment or pleasure). One way to account for all of this
is coherent with the multiple dependency theme applied to the regress
of <em>d&agrave;o</em>s of choice and evaluation of
performance&mdash;there are many different conceptions of benefit and
many different ways of measuring and points of view where benefit
judgments diverge. Zhuangzi&rsquo;s most beloved example is the
usefulness to a tree of its being useless to humans which
interestingly wars with his story a goose who is killed for being
useless&mdash;not being able to honk (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 20:1).</p>

<h3 id="RelaItDepeH">4.5 Relativism: It depends on &hellip;</h3>

<p>
The <em>Zhuangzi</em> emphasizes the plurality of natural stances or
points of view from which one may see paths of possible behavior as
&ldquo;natural&rdquo;. For one of the paths to be available for
<em>me</em> will be dependent on where I am <em>galloping</em> and at
what speed and direction in my <em>given</em> trajectory in the
network. All the appeals to <em>ti&#257;n</em> (nature) as an
authority are right in insisting their <em>d&agrave;o</em>s are
natural, but mistaken in using that as a reason to deny a similar
status to the <em>d&agrave;o</em>s of rival normative thinkers.
<em>Ti&#257;n</em> cannot serve as an arbiter of which rival norm is
correct since it equally &ldquo;puffs&rdquo; all of them out. This
allows each to claim their choices are of <em>ti&#257;n</em> (natural)
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s but does not allow them the corollary that their
rival&rsquo;s choices <em>violate ti&#257;n</em>. They, like us,
conform with <em>ti&#257;n</em>&rsquo;s constancies in being committed
to their <em>d&agrave;o</em>s.</p>

<p>
Any <em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em> (this: right) judgment concerning a
<em>d&agrave;o</em> would be a naturally <em>y&#299;n</em> (&#22240;
dependent) <em>sh&igrave;</em> judgment, based on prior or enacted
commitments, gestalts orientations, and inner processes. Those past
<em>d&agrave;o</em> commitments bring us to a normative stance here,
now, from which successive judgments of <em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em>
and <em>k&#283;</em> (&#21487; permissible) vs. not <em>k&#283;</em>
arise. Zhuangzi&rsquo;s pivotal illustration pairs &#26159;
<em>sh&igrave;</em> (this) with &#24444; <em>b&#464;</em> (that) as
near and far indexicals. &ldquo;Any thing can be a &lsquo;this;&rsquo;
any thing can be a &lsquo;that&rsquo;&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Local justifications for having <em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em> (this-not
that) or <em>k&#283;</em> (assertible) are delivered in accordance our
<em>ch&eacute;ng</em> (fixed) commitment momentum along the
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s that guided us to this point in time and space.
This relativity of normative dependence underpins Zhuangzi&rsquo;s
mildly ironic skepticism of special or extraordinary normative
statuses we give to, e.g., sages. We should doubt any transcendent or
allegedly perfect, totalistic epistemic access to nature&rsquo;s
inexpressible normative know-how. There are no <em>naturally
ideal</em> observers.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Will the eventual result be there is both <em>sh&igrave;</em>
(&#26159; this: right) and (&#24444; that)? Will the eventual result
be there is neither <em>sh&igrave;</em> nor <em>b&#464;</em>? We can
call the situation of neither <em>sh&igrave;</em> nor
<em>f&#275;i</em> finding its opposite the &ldquo;pivot of
<em>d&agrave;o</em> (&#36947; guides)&rdquo;. The pivot sets the start
of the center of a sphere from which there are inexhaustible
responses&mdash;inexhaustible <em>sh&igrave;</em> and inexhaustible
<em>f&#275;i</em>. Hence the saying &ldquo;nothing matches
<em>m&iacute;ng</em> (&#26126; discernment)&rdquo;. (<em>Zhuangzi</em>
2:5)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This cautious skepticism undergirds Zhuangzi&rsquo;s departure from
the primitivists&rsquo;. He neither concludes that we must not issue
<em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em> judgments nor that we must reject or deny
our natural, situational inclinations to <em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em>.
We should, instead, adopt an attitude of epistemic modesty, healthy
skepticism, while making our perspective-based choices and
recommending our interpretations to others. That modesty arises from
<em>m&iacute;ng</em> (clarity) that our perspective, like theirs,
arise from a complex and complicated natural <em>d&agrave;o</em>
structure. Zhuangzi&rsquo;s skepticism (below) does not indict our
epistemic apparatus; it&rsquo;s literally about the extent of our
lives in the great scheme of being. We are small, short-lived
creatures in a vastly complicated structure. Epistemic modesty also
undergirds Zhuangzi&rsquo;s openness and willingness to interact with
others. If nature has a point of view, it is one in which all
<em>actual d&agrave;o</em>s of <em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em>-ing in
nature are available as candidate guiding structures. Nature makes no
choice; it is not an actor with an absolute or superior normative
status on what is right, what to &ldquo;this&rdquo;. Nature makes
actual <em>d&agrave;o</em>s as candidates for us to <em>naturally</em>
(&#33258;&#28982; <em>z&igrave;r&aacute;n</em> self-realize) choose
and walk.</p>

<p>
Understanding <em>m&iacute;ng</em> (&#26126; illumination) as
awareness of this dependence on our history and the multiplicity of
such perspectives does not require that the perspectives are
impenetrable to each other. While they explain disagreement, they do
not require it. <em>M&iacute;ng</em> provokes us to realize that we
may make progress and improve our guiding perspective by
incorporating, simulating, and broadening to include the guiding
perspectives of others. A rare tale, by contrast, warns us about when
the <em>d&agrave;o</em>s of others do not mesh well with our natural
and pre-learned capacities&mdash;the boy from Shouling who goes to
learn the Handan way of walking which &ldquo;cripples&rdquo; his
original ability without mastering the Handan walk (<em>Zhuangzi</em>
17:10). Still a third outcome of the interaction, as with violent
gangsters and rulers, reminds us simply to keep our distance or if we
venture into the situation, to use extreme caution.</p>

<p>
A rival interpretation treats Zhuangzi&rsquo;s discussion of a Pivot
or Axis of <em>dao</em>s as an invitation to regard
<em>m&iacute;ng</em> as a cosmic perspective, <em>the view of
Nature</em>, from both everywhere and/or nowhere. M&iacute;ng is not a
limited, modest perspective on perspectives&mdash;a simple recognition
from <em>here</em> of many other natural perspectives around. This is
the kind of passage Ziporyn (2012) and Walker (2019) treat as ironic
because the transcendent unity of all things defies coherent
expression, or is &ldquo;boundless&rdquo;. Like Shen Dao&rsquo;s
<em>Great D&agrave;o</em>, it cannot offer meaningful guidance to any
proper <em>part</em> of the cosmos.</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;modest&rdquo; interpretation, by contrast, does not make
the Great <em>D&agrave;o</em> unintelligible <em>metaphysically</em>.
There is an evolving probability structure that is the
<em>d&agrave;o</em> of the universe. What is unintelligible is
regarding that Great <em>D&agrave;o</em> as
<em>prescriptive</em>&mdash;as something that guides us absolutely
rather than relative to who and where and when we are. It is
incoherent to treat great <em>D&agrave;o</em> as the guide to our
lives but also incoherent to regard the cosmos as <em>following</em> a
path. The <em>cosmos</em> (<em>ti&#257;n-d&igrave;</em> heaven-earth)
is not a decider or actor making &ldquo;this&rdquo;
&ldquo;not-that&rdquo; judgments. There are many deciders within
nature realizing options from here, now and great <em>D&agrave;o</em>
results from all those self-realizations. Follow the axis of
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s is ironic advice because it says do what you
<em>will</em> do. As Laozi told us, <em>d&agrave;o</em> follows
<em>z&igrave;r&aacute;n</em> (&#33258;&#28982; self-so, nature).
Normativity and choice emerge as the cosmos unfolds; the
<em>d&agrave;o</em> changes as we choose and enact one of the possible
paths nature offers us.</p>

<p>
As we saw above, Zhuangzi similarly treats talk about the perfect man,
one who has arrived, or sages who judge from the perspective of
<em>ti&#257;n</em> as ironic. <em>D&agrave;o</em> is monistic and
includes all perspectives as parts, but no actual being (proper part
of the cosmos) makes normative judgments from the perspective of
&ldquo;the One&rdquo;. Because of this, we don&rsquo;t try for a
perspectiveless perspective, but use the shared, common perspective of
our community (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 2:6). We can understand others with
whom we interact and find ways to accommodate and cooperate, which
Zhuangzi calls &ldquo;walking two ways&rdquo;). Learning from others
can also help us see how to walk in the natural paths together without
getting in the other&rsquo;s <em>way.</em> (<em>Zhuangzi</em>
2:6).</p>

<p>
It must also be ironic to say all paths are <em>right</em>, or all
<em>wrong</em>, or all <em>equal.</em> In understanding other&rsquo;s
trajectories along their <em>d&agrave;o</em>s, we <em>may</em> judge
them as correct or incorrect. We do this from some limited, local,
present perspective. From any actual perspective, we neither conclude
that all are right, wrong, or equal. Certainly, not all are equally
worthy of <em>our</em> choice. Nor need we judge that all are the
correct choices <em>for those following them</em>. We may
<em>m&iacute;ng</em> that their grounds for their choices are
different from ours and still find them dogmatic, careless, or
unwarranted in their application of <em>those</em> grounds. Nothing
about the mere <em>naturalness</em> of such choices arising makes them
<em>right</em>. All this is compatible with recognizing others as
natural creatures guided by natural inner processes along natural
guiding <em>d&agrave;o</em>s.</p>

<p>
We can and do judge that we might gain from being aware of and
engaging in open exchanges with different perspectives&mdash;as in
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s dialogues. We are more inclined to follow a path, and
given our similarities, think we might pursue it with benefit when we
know some natural being like us found and followed it. And Zhuangzi
clearly does ridicule the political moralists (Confucians and Mohists)
as well as Hui Shi for the narrowness of their range of
choices&mdash;their failure to appreciate the richness and complexity
of alternative ways of life.</p>

<p>
We learn from openness and exchange because we acquire commitments
from simulating others&rsquo; path following behavior. That we
progress in such exchanges is something we ourselves judge from here,
not the cosmos from nowhere. We are naturally influenced by
others&rsquo; evaluations, their judgments of our choices and their
behavioral virtuosity&mdash;especially when the others are our
parents, perceived superiors, and respected models. These, again, are
the <em>y&#299;n</em> (&#22240; dependencies) of our
<em>judgments</em> (<em>sh&igrave;</em>). The back history of our
learning-how extends to the emergence of life itself.</p>

<p>
This gives Zhuangzi&rsquo;s indexical relativism a different contour
from Hui Shi&rsquo;s. The latter structures his analysis mainly on
comparatives. This leads him to a version of normative &ldquo;error
theory&rdquo;&mdash;the conclusion that we should abandon normative
semantic distinctions as all wrong. Since the <em>bi&agrave;n</em>
(&#36783; distinctions) on which they are based are relative, they are
unreal. Ergo, there are no real distinctions and the world is a one
with no parts. Any distinction making judgment, any
<em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em> (this-not that), unnaturally divides
&ldquo;The One&rdquo;. Hui Shih&rsquo;s Tenth Thesis is:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Flood concern on all the 10,000 thing-kinds; The cosmos is one
<em>t&iacute;</em> (&#39636; unit-part). (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 33:7)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Graham, relying on his hypothesis that Zhuangzi frequently considers
positions which he later rejects, had already targeted this
stereotypical view of Zhuangzi as agreeing with Hui Shi&rsquo;s
monism. Graham&rsquo;s translation reveals the <em>reductio</em> that
puts monism in a &ldquo;considered and rejected&rdquo; category. It
amounts to the self-rebutting anti-language stance targeted by the
Later Mohists&mdash;the error Zhuangzi&rsquo;s naturalism of all
perspectives (the
 &ldquo;<a href="#pipesoftianquote">pipes of heaven</a>&rdquo;)
 was intended to avoid.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&ldquo;[H]eaven and earth were born together with me and the myriad
things and I are one&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Now that we are one, can I still say anything? Now that I have called
us one, did I succeed in not saying something? One and the saying make
two, two and one make three. Proceeding from here even an expert
calculator cannot get to the end of it, much less a plain man.
(<em>Zhuangzi</em> 2:9)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="ZhuaLang">4.6 Zhuangzi on Language</h3>

<p>
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s relativism expresses choice, commitment, and
interpretive performance on analogy to natural processes involved in
following a path. Commitment is setting off along a path. We have
momentum and a trajectory. The shape of the path combines with these
and <em>commits</em> us to walk on or continue in a way that depends
on the discernible shape of the path. Walking a path involves staying
<em>mostly</em> within its physical boundaries.</p>

<p>
This account allows us to capture the flavor of Zhuangzi&rsquo;s
discussion which differs from the familiar Western sentence-based
metaphors of laws, rules, principles with norms of <em>obedience</em>,
<em>belief</em>, or propositional desire. If we used the Western
idiom, we would add the distinction between a cause and a reason.
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s relativist talk of <em>y&#299;n</em> (&#22240;
dependence) on our location, trajectory and momentum on a path of
choosing and interpreting courses of behavior guided by our internal
<em>d&eacute;</em> (&#24503; virtuosity) feedback loop as we
&ldquo;read&rdquo; and translate external paths into behavior is
natural but not fatalistic. Ziporyn (2013) highlighted the physical
coherence of our <em>l&#464;</em> (internal <em>d&agrave;o</em>) and
growing <em>virtuosity</em> as we become better at choosing and
processing natural guidance.</p>

<p>
Zhuangzi, thus, would not make his point in terms of deduction from a
normative premise or principle. The internal and external paths
themselves have a causal and normative relation to our walking
behavior. A Western sentential focus would similarly mean describing
the outcome as <em>an action</em> rather than an extended <em>course
of</em> walking/following behavior. Performing a role in a play or a
part in a symphony fits better in Zhuangzi&rsquo;s metaphorical space.
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s reaction to Shen Dao&rsquo;s fatalism is not the
assertion of Western &ldquo;free will&rdquo; but starts from living
things <em>z&igrave;r&aacute;n</em>, themselves choosing and realizing
a possibility for their behavior.</p>

<p>
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s use of the path metaphor did extend to the
understanding of language but, again, not with a focus on sententials.
Rather than constructing <em>d&agrave;o</em>s in sentential form,
Zhuangzi construes language itself as a bit of a social
<em>d&agrave;o</em>&mdash;an environmental possibility of verbal
behavior for a human in <em>that</em> time and place to learn and
master. The focus of ancient Chinese theory was on names on the
analogy of path markers: &ldquo;go past the tree, turn right, and then
down to the water&rdquo;. Names take on importance as sign-posts along
physical structures. Confucian social versions emphasized the names of
social roles and social statuses. Mozi expanded the model to include
natural kinds. Primitivist opposition to social <em>d&agrave;o</em>s
led them into the sweeping anti-naming postures that Later Mohists
showed to be self-condemning.</p>

<p>
Graham&rsquo;s interpretation of Zhuangzi&rsquo;s
 <a href="#pipesoftianquote">pipes of nature</a>
 pictured language as natural sound. Zhuangzi&rsquo;s relativism,
however, is more careful than Hui Shi&rsquo;s. Hui Shi used relativist
premises to derive an absolutist monism which collapsed into the
familiar self-defeating primitivist anti-language quietism. Hui Shi
viewed making everything one as <em>denying</em>
(<em>f&#275;i</em>-ing) any <em>bi&agrave;n</em> (&#36783;
distinctions). That, the Mohists said, was <em>f&#275;i</em>-ing
<em>f&#275;i</em>-ing. That was a second example the Later Mohists
gave of self-defeating, anti-language formulae. It <em>f&#275;i</em>-s
all <em>m&iacute;ng</em> (&#21517; terms) and <em>y&aacute;n</em>
(words: language) itself.</p>

<p>
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s naturalism is anti-dogmatic; it neither denies nor
affirms any particular set of distinctions as <em>authentic</em>
(<em>zh&#275;n</em>). Distinctions emerge at indexed (here-now) points
in the network of real-world of actually possible <em>d&agrave;o</em>
perspectives. We, in our social groups, are travelers on a trajectory
along one of the <em>d&agrave;o</em>s of choosing
<em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em> (&#26159;&#38750;) from among multiple
possible courses of human group behavior afforded by the cosmos. Our
group, not the cosmos, selected which way to make the choice.</p>

<p>
When Zhuangzi returns to the metaphor later in the chapter, he agrees
that language is not <em>merely</em> wind. Those who use language have
language. The Later Mohists are right that languages have built-in
<em>aboutness</em>. Their mistake is in regarding what language is
about as <em>fixed</em>&mdash;Mohist semantic realism.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Language is not blowing; those who use language, have language. That
which is languages is decidedly not yet fixed. Is the eventual result
that they have language? Or there has never been language? Deeming it
as different from bird calls: does that mark a distinction? Or is
there no distinction? (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 2:4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The Later Mohists had also argued that when a <em>bi&agrave;n</em>
(&#36783; distinction) was formulated as a
<em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em>, e.g., one of the disputants calls it
&ldquo;ox&rdquo; and the other &ldquo;not-ox&rdquo;, one of them must
<em>sh&egrave;ng</em> (&#21213; win), i.e., <em>d&#257;ng</em>
(&#30070; hit on it). Zhuangzi denies that &ldquo;winning&rdquo;
(<em>sh&egrave;ng</em>) in a relevant social process (game of
supporting a way of distinguishing by appealing to a higher-order way
of distinguishing) means one is <em>gu&#466;</em> (&#26524;
substantively) <em>sh&igrave;</em> (correct).</p>

<p>
This <em>d&agrave;o</em>-centered insight resembles the observation
that one could &ldquo;win&rdquo; the game of giving and asking for
reasons for a propositional belief, which could still fail to be true.
Even if &ldquo;winning&rdquo; consists in constructing the better
argument, and although rationalists may view valid reasoning as
<em>tending toward</em> truth, Zhuangzi&rsquo;s analogue of the
&ldquo;norm of truth&rdquo; entails that one may have the better
argument and still be wrong. <em>Zhuangzi</em> does not have the
rationalist <em>concept</em> of truth, but he has a conception of
&ldquo;the norm of truth&rdquo;. (See Fraser 2012 for a related claim
about Later Mohists&rsquo; concept of <em>d&#257;ng</em>&mdash;that it
plays the <em>expressive</em> role of truth).</p>

<p>
Zhuangzi construes winning as one side conceding or getting the
approval of a judge (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 2:12). The Later Mohists&rsquo;
common-sense realism incorporated social conventions. Conventions set
out what <em>w&ugrave;</em> (&#29289; natural-kind) each term
&ldquo;selects out&rdquo; or <em>bi&agrave;n</em> (distinguishes) from
the rest. They then <em>extend</em> that distinction to select out new
realities relying on similarity or difference (being accessible to
&ldquo;eyes and ears&rdquo; of ordinary people). Hui Shi, however, had
argued that between any two <em>w&ugrave;</em> (&#29289;
natural-kinds) there is <em>some</em> similarity and <em>some</em>
difference. So, even with a &ldquo;winning&rdquo; concept in place,
there may be many ways to project it on other realities. So even the
agreement of a community could not finally fix the reference of the
term.</p>

<p>
The Later Mohists had ruled out what they called
<em>ku&#257;ngj&#468;</em> (&#29378;&#33289; wild picking out), but
failed to find an adequate account of what similarities would count as
<em>wild</em> and <em>not-wild</em>. The frustrating vagueness and
signature indecision in the text&rsquo;s comparison of language to
bird-calls leaves interpreters free to treat this observation as
ironic. But it need not be. The analogy with bird calls might be a
fortuitous suggestion. We arrange, adapt, and modulate the elements of
our language to fit our environment, abilities, and opportunities
(e.g., mating). Had Zhuangzi guessed the same about birds? Zhuangzi
otherwise accepts our social nature and the social nature of
language&mdash;but only, he emphasizes, pragmatically.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Only those who &ldquo;break through&rdquo; know how to communicate
with it as a &ldquo;one&rdquo;. Because of this, we don&rsquo;t use
that strategy and instead locate things in the common realm. The
common is useful; the useful, communicable, and the communicable
achievable. If you hit on the achievable, you are nearly there and
dependent <em>sh&igrave;</em>s end. (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 2:6)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Humans, in finding ways to walk and walking them, initiate the
construction of social paths, naturally and perhaps unintentionally,
by leaving prints in the natural world. Zhuangzi links the path
metaphor to a society&rsquo;s linguistic practice thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
That which we treat as <em>k&#283;</em> (&#21487; assertible) is
<em>k&#283;</em> (&#21487; assertible); that which we treat as not
assertible is not assertible. <em>D&agrave;o</em>s are made by walking
them; thing-kinds are made <em>r&aacute;n</em> (&#28982; so) by being
called &ldquo;so&rdquo;. (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 2:6)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This sense of the immense complexity and the fluid nature of normative
commitments to a <em>d&agrave;o</em> (path) underlie Zhuangzi&rsquo;s
skeptical themes. <em>M&iacute;ng</em> (&#26126; clear: discerning)
seems linked to the gestalt in which we accept ourselves as embedded,
along with others similarly situated, in nature&rsquo;s endlessly
complex evolution of guiding structures.</p>

<h3 id="Skep">4.7 Skepticism</h3>

<p>
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s argument using the <em>warning function</em> of a
norm of truth (even when justified by our best available judging
standards, we may still be wrong) leads to one of his formulations of
skepticism. We cannot finally settle skeptical doubts by winning
disputes, particularly not by appeal to a judge or authority.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
So, you and I and others cannot know, and in these conditions on what
other can we rely? The changing sounds&rsquo; mutual dependence is
like their conjoint autonomy. Harmonize them with glances at nature
and make them dependent on eventual consensus and with that exhaust
the years. (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 2:12)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The conclusion is less a solution to the skeptical problem posed than
merely a way to cope constructively with the complexity and
uncertainty of normative guidance for creatures like us in this vast
complicated network of possibility. The prior passages ruled out any
appeal to a special authority of any other point of view&mdash;while
giving a similar role in the construction to all. The construction
results from each of our choices from our indexed point of view.
However useful and widely shared, this &ldquo;conventional
wisdom&rdquo; does not have special authority&mdash;say, over other
creatures. This passage follows Zhuangzi&rsquo;s notorious toying with
the perspectives of animals:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Gap-tooth asked Kingsley, &ldquo;Do you know that which all natural
kinds agree in <em>endorsing</em> (<em>sh&igrave;</em>
this-ing)?&rdquo;</p>

<p>
He answers, &ldquo;How would I know that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then, do you know of what you don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And how could I know that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So, does no natural kind know anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And how would I know that? Nonetheless, let me try to put it in
language. How would I know that what I call &lsquo;knowing&rsquo; is
not &lsquo;not-knowing&rsquo;? And what I call
&lsquo;not-knowing&rsquo;, &lsquo;knowing&rsquo;. And let me try a
question on you. If people sleep in the damp, they get pains and
paralysis; would eels? If in a tree, they tremble in fear; would
monkeys? Of the three, does any know the correct place to live?
&hellip; From where I see it, the origins of goodness and morality,
painting things as &lsquo;this/right&rsquo; or
&lsquo;not-that/wrong&rsquo; are, as boundaries, both confused and
complicated; how could I know how to distinguish them?&rdquo;
(<em>Zhuangzi</em> 2:11)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The skeptical conclusion about the norms of correct word use makes
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s skepticism Chinese, unlike Western skepticism of
beliefs. The Later Mohists divided knowing how to use words into four
parts, knowing terms, knowing objects, knowing how to match them, and
acting (on that matching). We know-of a term and an object and how to
match them in guiding our behavior. Knowing how to use words is
something we learn from our different pasts. Linguistic skepticism
easily metastasizes to virtually any commitment expressed in terms
that distinguish one thing from others. Even given a past practice, it
applies to a present alleged conformity to that practice. According to
which <em>d&agrave;o</em> of projecting past practice should we judge
<em>this</em> linguistic behavior as conforming to our commitment and
<em>that</em> not? Normative skepticism in a use-theory is hard to
contain&mdash;especially when the model of all judgments is as some
indexed <em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em> (&#26159;&#38750; this-not that)
assignment of terms to the world. It sweeps in metaphysics,
epistemics, and semantics.</p>

<p>
A consequence is that Zhuangzi&rsquo;s skepticism is broad but weak.
Broad because it infects so many judgments, but weak in the epistemic
sense of denying final certainty but allowing for varying degrees of
knowledge. Donald Sturgeon (2015) has helped to clarify this feature
of Zhuangzi&rsquo;s epistemology. He credits the text&rsquo;s
non-ironic reference to greater and lesser knowing and calls
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s a &ldquo;positive&rdquo; skepticism. (Other proposed
terms for substantive <em>mild</em> skepticism are <em>constructive
skepticism</em> [Wong 2022], <em>epistemic modesty</em> [Hansen 2003],
and <em>fallibilism</em> [Coutinho 2015].) The <em>true</em> skeptical
thesis encourages gaining <em>m&iacute;ng</em> (insight,
understanding) into other perspectives to improve our epistemic
<em>d&eacute;</em> (virtuosity). It reminds us that we are equipped to
find our way, given our various natures, around our bit of the natural
structure. It does not equip us to fathom the whole, but curiosity,
open-mindedness, and <em>understanding</em> (<em>m&iacute;ng</em>)
another perspective helps us <em>know</em> more and better.</p>

<p>
Positive skepticism, like non-substantive <em>therapeutic
skepticism</em> (Raphals, Kjellberg, and Schwitzgebel, in Kjellberg
and Ivanhoe (eds) 1996), is a recommendation, but remains true
skepticism because it reminds us &ldquo;our confidence in our own
comprehensive view is neither reliable nor unique to us&rdquo; (Hansen
2003). We are normally inclined to overestimate our knowing. We learn
this from past experience of coming to appreciate another
perspective&mdash;Sturgeon highlights Zhuangzi&rsquo;s story of the
Earl of the river, proud of its massive extent, flowing on and
discovering the more impressive perspective of the Lord of the North
Sea. Adopting the new perspective, the Earl is immediately tempted to
think he <em>now</em> has the correct comprehensive view until
reminded by the Lord of the North Sea of its smallness in the great
scheme of the universe (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 17:1&ndash;2).</p>

<p>
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s skepticism is mild because it does not constitute a
reason to abandon what we know nor to avoid acting when we know how.
Appreciating other natural perspectives does remind us that our view,
even if recently broadened, is still subject to further improvement.
It should provoke curiosity, not paralysis. It does not rest on any
theory of the probability of an error arising from <em>this</em>
<em>d&agrave;o</em> of knowing. It rests only on the existence of
other natural ways of knowing. As such, it neither undermines what we
have learned nor give us reason to stop practicing known behaviors .
Appreciating that others reach their perspective as naturally as we do
only removes our claim to special natural status for making judgments.
We are equally situated in natural situations calling for guidance but
differently endowed to know and act.</p>

<p>
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s skepticism is supported by our own past experiences
of learning, of acquiring new gestalts, of realizing that what we had
considered <em>the</em> way, was subject to reconsideration and
improvement. It reminds me to remain open to the further possibility
of learning. We can benefit from open-minded survey of other natural
ways, how other natural creatures, human and not, process and perform
in our shared world&mdash;we learn there are other
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s.</p>

<p>
Gaptooth&rsquo;s drawing attention to different conceptions of knowing
lies at the heart of the famous debate between Zhuangzi and Hui Shi
about knowing of fish-pleasure in which Zhuangzi <em>defends</em> a
claim to know against Hui Shi&rsquo;s epistemic challenge. Different
concepts of &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; underwrite different norms of using
it in different contexts of application.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Zhuangzi and Hui Shi wandered over the Hao River bridge. Zhuangzi
said, &ldquo;those mini-fish coming from there and cruising around,
relaxed and unhurried, are fish at leisure&rdquo;. Hui Shi said,
&ldquo;You are not a fish; from whence do you know the leisure of
fish?&rdquo; Zhuangzi retorted, &ldquo;You are not me, from whence do
you know my not knowing fish at leisure?&rdquo; Hui Shi responds,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not you, of course I don&rsquo;t know about you; You
are not a fish and that&rsquo;s enough to count as you&rsquo;re not
knowing fish&rsquo;s leisure&rdquo;. Zhuangzi concludes,
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s return to where we started. When you said,
&lsquo;from what perspective do you know fish at leisure&rsquo;, you
clearly knew my knowing it as you asked me. I knew it here above the
Hao&rdquo;. (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 17:13)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Graham drew our attention to the role of perspective in this passage,
noting that Hui Shi&rsquo;s challenge to Zhuangzi&rsquo;s assertion
does not use the normal question form (&#20309; <em>h&eacute;</em> how
do you know?), but a locative question word (&#23433; <em>&#257;n</em>
whence?). This brings the debate into alignment with Zhuangzi&rsquo;s
concern about the various perspectives from which to deploy a
<em>d&agrave;o</em> of word use. Here, as above, the word is
<em>zh&#299;</em> (&#30693; know). The norm of asserting, as in
English, involves answering the challenge &ldquo;how do you
know?&rdquo; What normative conditions allow me, here and now,
correctly to use the term <em>zh&#299;</em> (know)&mdash;hence to make
the assertion about these fish below me? Hui Shi both knew Zhuangzi
was relying on a <em>d&agrave;o</em> of using &lsquo;know&rsquo;
&ldquo;from Zhuangzi&rsquo;s here&rdquo; <strong>and</strong> Hui Shi
knew Zhuangzi&rsquo;s situation from his own relevantly similar
&ldquo;here-now&rdquo; and relying on <strong>the same</strong>
<em>d&agrave;o</em> (&#36947; norm) of claiming to know from a
distinct perspective. Hui Shi cannot consistently insist that speakers
can only use <em>zh&#299;</em> (&#30693; know) when they occupy the
perspective of the object they are aware of.</p>

<h3 id="PersPers">4.8 Perspectives on Perspectives</h3>

<p>
The argument about knowing the perspective of fish implies we can have
a perspective on the perspectives of others without sharing their
subjectivity. Daoist theory of others&rsquo; <em>minds</em> would work
by seeing <em>from here</em> the paths of behavior available to them
and their current direction and speed-commitment along an existing
path. Knowing <em>from here</em> would follow different norms from
knowing <em>in there</em>. Zhuangzi, here, uses perspective relativism
to justify a way of claiming to know.</p>

<p>
In other parables, he addresses the kind of knowing that comes after a
gestalt shift, especially when we see our own and others&rsquo; points
of view as similar&mdash;see ourselves as others see us. A benefit is
our self-recognition as a creature embedded as are others within a
natural perspective in a network of perspectives. This picture of
ourselves encourages being open-minded, humbling our epistemic pride,
mildly disrupting our judgment equilibrium. Without this perspective
on ourselves, we too easily fall into exaggerating our epistemic
exceptionalism. The reminder that we are intermingled with others in a
web of natural perspectives serves as a realistic correction. A
Zhuangzi story illustrates such a moment.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Zhuangzi was wandering in Diaoling fields when he glimpsed a weird
magpie-like-thing flying in from the south. It had a wingspan of over
seven feet and passed so close his forehead, he could feel it. Then it
gathered its wings and settled in a chestnut grove. Zhuangzi thought
&ldquo;what bird is that? Massive wings of such power and eyes so
large it couldn&rsquo;t see me&rdquo;. He hiked up his robe and
hurriedly tiptoed closer holding his crossbow at the ready. Then he
spotted a cicada settling in the shaded shelter without a worry for
itself, but a praying mantis opened its pincers about to grab it, also
focused on its gain and ignoring its own bodily danger. The strange
magpie burst out and harvested them both&mdash;similarly unaware of
the natural dangers he faced. But Zhuangzi was suddenly seized with
this thought, &ldquo;We natural kinds are all interconnected! We
varied species are mutually seeing things in our own ways&rdquo;.
Suddenly, hearing the game warden running toward him shouting out his
crime, he puts away his crossbow and flees. (<em>Zhuangzi</em>
20:8)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is the more comprehensive perspective on perspectives Zhuangzi
urges on us. We experience such gestalt shifts especially when we come
to appreciate the limitations of our prior perspective now that we
view things differently. We confidently judge <em>now</em> that we
have made epistemic progress&mdash;our new awareness seems relatively
improved to us after the shift. We judge our own former perspective as
inferior to our present one. We do not infer that our present
perspective is final or privileged. We naturally worry that we have
not made the final correction. Sturgeon contrasts Zhuangzi&rsquo;s
epistemic perspective on perspectives (&#26126; <em>m&iacute;ng</em>
clarity) with Xunzi&rsquo;s which simply condemns all
&ldquo;blinkering&rdquo; by perspectives. That&rsquo;s the epistemic
nihilist posture (philosophical quietism) we could call
<em>ironic</em>.</p>

<p>
The limitation of the gestalt shift is clear in the above story of the
River Earl. The North Sea Lord warns the River Earl not to confuse
this insight with having reached an ultimate state of knowledge. He
casts doubt on there being a final, ultimately small <em>or</em>
large.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The lord of He river said, &ldquo;So can I consider cosmos
&lsquo;large&rsquo; and the tip of a hair as
&lsquo;small&rsquo;?&rdquo; North Sea Ruo replied, &ldquo;No!
Thing-kinds have unlimited ways of measuring; Time has no end;
distinctions have no constancy, beginning and ending no inherent base.
Because of this great knowing is viewed as a degree of distance and
closeness. &hellip;We calculate that what humans know is never as
great as what they do not know, their temporal extent of life is less
than time before life; for the puny to try to comprehend the immense
is an invitation to confusion and disorder. There is nothing to be
gained there&rdquo;. (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 17:3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If Zhuangzi&rsquo;s <em>m&iacute;ng</em> entails having a sense of our
limited perspective, it embodies several sound lessons. There is
neither a view from nowhere nor from everywhere. My perspective is not
privileged, but neither is any ruler&rsquo;s or any sage&rsquo;s.
Credulous, dogmatic absolutists by contrast imagine they (or Zhuangzi)
can reach a mystical, privileged view that is inaccessible to ordinary
beings.</p>

<p>
Understanding that no perspective is privileged makes skepticism less
threatening. I do not have to abandon my present perspective to be
open-minded and curious about others. We are aware of our limitations,
but not paralyzed or unable to act on our knowledge. We are still as
naturally situated as those with whom we disagree. We mutually
appreciate why it is hard for the other to see things from our point
of view. Further improvement might come from further exchange of
perspectives. We might come to agree, you win me over or vice versa.
We might not and still improve our understanding from your
&ldquo;glimpse of nature&rdquo;. Or we might merely learn to keep our
distance from each other. We cannot know perfectly, but we can know
better.</p>

<p>
The na&iuml;ve Confucian-Mohist advocates of imposing a single social
<em>d&agrave;o</em> thus disrupts the natural process by which social
<em>d&agrave;o</em>s evolve in real time as they seek harmony. While
we cannot help making our own judgments and commitments, Zhuangzi sees
tolerance and accommodation as values that follow from appreciating
other natural perspectives:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A monkey keeper says (to the monkeys) &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you three
[rations] in the morning and four in the evening&rdquo;. The monkeys
seemed angry. &ldquo;Ok, I&rsquo;ll give you four in the morning and
three in the evening&rdquo;. The monkeys were happy. So, with no
substantive loss, he could change their anger to happiness. This is an
example of a <em>sh&igrave;</em> judgment being dependent on
circumstances. Thus, the sage uses <em>sh&igrave;-f&#275;i</em>
(this-not that) judgments to bring harmony and rests in a natural
balance. We can call this walking in pairs. (<em>Zhuangzi</em>
2:6)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We are, as it happens, capable of understanding the perspectives of
others well enough to accommodate and cooperate with them, to borrow
insights and to reach agreements. These accommodations and agreements
are constructed social <em>d&agrave;o</em>s. <em>Morality</em> is a
concept within a social <em>d&agrave;o</em> as is <em>knowing</em>.
The Chinese concept, like the Western one, enshrines a contrast with
<em>mores</em>&mdash;the moral conception of a particular community at
a particular time. The Western contrast is conceptually linked to the
core of rationalism&mdash;reason, especially pure reason. The Chinese
concept is of an imagined community of all &ldquo;under heaven&rdquo;.
The <em>Zhuangzi</em>&rsquo;s skepticism questions if we can
extrapolate from our ordinary capacity to broaden our perspective to
imagine such an &ldquo;all in&rdquo; normative structure. While we
experience a gestalt broadening of perspective as revealing something
real and significant (like waking from a dream), a final such
awakening remains a possible, but distant hope&mdash;best viewed as a
regulative ideal. Like the norm of truth, it prompts epistemic
modesty.</p>

<p>
Talk of political morality hardly breaks the surface in the
<em>Zhuangzi</em> text. His most famous statement on political
morality was his refusal to take up a post of honor offered by
emissaries from a ruler:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Zhuangzi was fishing in the Pu when two emissaries from the ruler of
Chu approached with the message &ldquo;Please take charge of my
kingdom&rdquo;. Zhuangzi, focused on his fishing pole, did not deign
to glance at them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard the Chu king keeps a
sapient tortoise, dead for 3000 years, wrapped in a robe in a basket
hung high in the imperial temple. Now, would this turtle prefer being
dead and having its remains so honored to being alive and dragging its
tail in the mud?&rdquo; The two envoys replied, &ldquo;He&rsquo;d
prefer being alive and dragging his tail in the mud&rdquo;. Zhuangzi
muttered, &ldquo;Off you go! I&rsquo;ll be dragging my tail in the
mud&rdquo;. (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 17:11)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Modern debate about the political implications of Zhuangzi&rsquo;s
philosophy, by contrast, is more than copious. The central issue is
whether Zhuangzi&rsquo;s skeptical relativism applies to morality in a
way that would render us <em>indifferent</em> to Hitler&rsquo;s
genocide (Van Norden 2016). This objection to Daoism is an ancient
Confucian one&mdash;without the anachronistic example. If and how it
applies depends very much on how we interpret Zhuangzi&rsquo;s
<em>m&iacute;ng</em>.</p>

<p>
In all cases, the interaction results in improvement in knowing as
judged <em>by the knower from their prior d&agrave;o</em>. Each makes
the accommodation with their own prior commitment along their way,
with the addition of now understanding how the other works in its
natural context (and other prior d&agrave;o commitments). We do
naturally judge that we know better after each &ldquo;awakening&rdquo;
encounter while remaining epistemically modest. We understand the
other may have had a different awakening to what <em>they</em> view as
greater knowing. The mild skepticism amounts to not knowing if these
wakings-up will converge or terminate. Typically, like the keeper and
his monkeys, we know how to find a way to co-exist without
conflict&mdash;walking two paths at once&mdash;occasionally agreeing
only to stay out of each other&rsquo;s way.</p>

<p>
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s refusal to take up the rule of a state is consistent
with tolerance, given the apparent options in his time and place. The
Warring States&rsquo; models of government were of either the
Confucians or Mohists imposing their favored, <em>single
d&agrave;o</em> on everyone using the apparatus of the state&mdash;the
monopoly on coercion or control of the educational curriculum.
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s refusal to participate is morally consistent since
his natural options did not include a constitutional democracy with a
rule of law administered neutrally to allow the widest possible
choices of naturally compatible ways of life. It is understandable if
his modern followers, like Chen Guying, appeal to his outlook to
support a democratic free state. While we cannot credit him with
having worked out that political <em>d&agrave;o</em>, it seems unfair
to fault him for not having invented liberal political theory.</p>

<p>
His default political outcome is a broadly evolutionary construction
of coalitions of the types listed above. The <em>Zhuangzi</em>
includes a passage many treat as ironic that (obscurely as usual)
envisions this possibility. He lists eight <em>virtuosities</em>
(&#24503; <em>d&eacute;</em>) which presumably guide the choice of
outcomes when two natural ways of life meet.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
When <em>d&agrave;o</em>s haven&rsquo;t yet guided a territory and
language hasn&rsquo;t yet achieved constancy, we can deem some
notional boundaries. Please state these guidelines. There is left and
there is right. There or levels and there is morality, there are parts
and there are distinctions, there is competition and there is war.
These are called the eight virtuosities. (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 2:10)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The proposal here is continuous with Sturgeon&rsquo;s account of
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s &ldquo;positive skepticism&rdquo;, where the openness
to other normative perspectives may result in several outcomes.
Optimistically one <em>d&agrave;o</em>ist may adopt part or all of the
perspective of the other or, as with the monkey keeper, find
accommodation that allows both to choose their own way.
Pessimistically we may construct a conception of evil or disgust
towards the other and end in war. Positive skeptical relativism,
otherwise, minimally impacts our moral behavior.</p>

<p>
The understanding that others are moving on different trajectories
does change either our moral direction or momentum. It alerts us to
alter course to avoid interfering with their
movement&mdash;metaphorically not to kill or punish or abuse them for
peacefully following a different road. It does not give Zhuangzi any
further reason not to continue to follow the best path by his
lights&mdash;now <em>enlightened</em> (<em>m&iacute;ng</em>) by
learning how many other ways of life go. Open-minded conversation with
others is his <em>way</em>.</p>

<p>
Zhuangzi need not abandon the tolerance that motivated him to decline
rule in ancient China. His open-minded behavior in seeking better to
understand the <em>d&agrave;o</em>s of thieves and tyrants would help
us be sensitive to similar tendencies <em>we</em> display, the
genocide of aboriginal populations, rationalizing slavery and
segregation, invading other countries, and seek to change their
cultures by force and lack of respect for difference. What we learn
from the Hitler example is to recognize how we might end up similarly
blinkered to our own fallibility.</p>

<p>
Near the end of his epistemic reflection, Zhuangzi treats the gestalt
shift that accompanies a leap to a more comprehensive perspective,
knowing better, on the analogy of dreaming and waking up. At
awakening, we immediately appreciate the unreality of the dream,
interpreting it as a dream. This awareness of cognitive progress is
real, but still subject to mild skepticism. We may dream of having a
similar gestalt shift and then, awakening, interpreted <em>that</em>
dream.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
When we dream, we don&rsquo;t know it as a dream, and in our dreams,
judge something else as a dream. On awakening, we know it was a dream,
and there could be another greater awakening in which we know a
greater dream. The ignorant too think they are as enlightened as if
they had learned it by an investigation. Gentlemen to shepherds
inherently do this! (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 2:12)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The skeptical difference from a &ldquo;final awakening&rdquo; concerns
whether these paths of broadening from different starting points will
converge on a single outcome. So, is there an ultimate or final
possible such shift in gestalt&mdash;some final state of knowing what
to do? Zhuangzi&rsquo;s relativism is mildly skeptical of the
relativism itself. Perhaps&hellip;</p>

<p>
The mild skepticism of our trajectory to greater knowledge is most
famously illustrated in the story of Zhuangzi dreaming being a
butterfly and/or vice versa. It seems to suggest that the gestalt
sense of liberation from error may go both ways. Perhaps our
subsequent perspective is one from which most would move to our former
perspective. Some adolescents are converted <em>to</em> religion
others from it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Once before, Zhuangzi dreamt of being a butterfly, gaily butterflying
and himself embodied in this sense of purpose! He knew nothing of
Zhuangzi. Suddenly awakening, he then is rooted in Zhuangzi. He
doesn&rsquo;t know if Zhuangzi dreamt of being a butterfly or a
butterfly is dreaming of being Zhuangzi&mdash;though there must be a
difference. This is called &ldquo;things change&rdquo;.
(<em>Zhuangzi</em> 2:14)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Finally, consider Zhuangzi&rsquo;s non-ironic examples of real-life
spectacular know-how&mdash;the most beautifully and elaborately
expressed of which is the passage celebrating Butcher Ding.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Butcher Ding carved an ox for Lord Wen Hui; his point of contact, the
way he inclined his torso, his foot position, the angle of his knee
&hellip; gliding, flowing! The knife sang &ldquo;whuaa&rdquo; with
nothing out of tune. It was as if he were dancing the Faun Ballet or
directing an opera.</p>

<p>
Lord Wen Hui exclaimed &ldquo;Ole! Splendidly done! Can talent extend
even to this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Butcher Ding gestured with his knife, explaining,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
What your servant follows is a <em>d&agrave;o</em>; that is what skill
aims for. When I began to carve oxen, I saw nothing but an ox. After
three years, I had ceased seeing oxen as whole, and now my sapience
entangles so that I don&rsquo;t see with my eyes, Sensory know-how
ends, and my sapient guidance takes over my performance. I rely on
natural guiding structures, separate out the great chunks and steer
through empty gaps depending on the anatomy. I evade places where
cords and filaments intertwine, much less the large bones.</p>

<p>
A good cook gets a new knife every year; he chops! Mediocre cooks
change knives monthly; they hack. My knife now has 19 years on it;
it&rsquo;s carved several thousand oxen and the edge is as if I had
just taken it from the sharpener.</p>

<p>
Those joints have gaps, and the knife&rsquo;s edge no thickness, to
put something infinitesimally thin in an empty space?! Effortless! It
even allows the edge wander in with ample room to play. That is why,
with 19 years on it, this knife&rsquo;s edge is grindstone fresh.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(<em>Zhuangzi</em> 3:2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <em>Zhuangzi</em> plays several variations on this theme.
Sometimes the virtuoso performer catches cicadas on a sticky rod,
another crafts chariot wheels; there are musicians, debaters, and
thieves. The theme extends to animals, millipedes with their expertise
in coordinating their limbs while maintaining a smooth flow, snakes
flashing by while slithering on their stomachs. One implicit example
is Zhuangzi&rsquo;s own relation with his relativist rival and buddy,
Hui Shi. Bemoaning Hui Shi&rsquo;s loss while visiting his
sidekick&rsquo;s grave, Zhuangzi spins a tale of a virtuoso ax-thrower
who sliced specks off the nose of his crony. He lost his
&ldquo;knack&rdquo; when his co-performer passed away
(<em>Zhuangzi</em> 24:6).</p>

<p>
These tales highlight several themes that illustrate the range of
second level <em>m&iacute;ng</em> attitudes that accompany learned
behavior that skillfully follows a natural path. One is the tranquil
state that accompanies behavior that skillfully follows a natural
path. The performances look and feel effortless. The spontaneity of
the flow along a natural path gives performers the sense that their
behavior is &ldquo;world-guided&rdquo; rather than internally
controlled. These behaviors become second-nature as we real-ize how we
are entangled with the objects&mdash;knee, knife, and knot. We move
beyond anything like sub-vocalizing instructions, deliberating, or
reflecting&mdash;and yet we are concentrating intently on our
performance. The range of his examples reminds us that such satisfying
states of performance can be experienced in even the lowest caste and
mundane of activities, including butchering and criminal skills, not
merely in fine arts and philosophy.</p>

<p>
Another theme is the different understandings that accompany stages of
learning as one approaches this effortless flow. Finally, this
non-ironic praise of sublime achievement in know-how is the
observation that such expertise in performance always comes with some
kind of limitation&mdash;not least that each example is a different
person with a different knack. There is no shortcut d&agrave;o that
gives you a knack at every activity. Cook Ding &ldquo;comes to a hard
place&rdquo;; the cicada catcher warms up by trying to balance two
coins on his stick&mdash;if he is not calm enough, he will have a bad
night. The wheelwright could not teach his son the art; the musician
cannot play all the notes and only reaches true perfection when he
dwells in silence. The valorization of this kind of specialization in
an art pulls in the opposite direction of Zhuangzi&rsquo;s
encouragement to broaden and enlarge our perspectives and scope of
appreciation.</p>

<p>
This theme of the limits of virtuosity is pursued explicitly in the
<em>Zhuangzi</em>&rsquo;s discussion of the necessary connection
between <em>ch&eacute;ng</em> (&#25104; completion:success) and
<em>ku&#299;</em> (&#34407; failure: deficiency). The theme of this
weak skeptical relativism plays out smoothly into the classical
Chinese focus on paths as the model of normativity and the objects of
knowledge. Paths are everywhere but guide natural kinds from
particular space-time locations and can guide a wide range of behavior
types and normative subject matters. Each leads to subsequent choices
among <em>d&agrave;o</em>s (paths).</p>

<p>
Zhuangzi does not ground his skepticism in an account of specifically
human epistemic deficiencies. We are one among many natural creatures
with different capacities, choosing paths from their indexed point in
space and time. The skeptical theme is not the absence of, but the
plethora of, different perspectives and perspectives on perspectives.
We are limited in two senses:</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:decimal">

<li>There is no behavior from the point of view of the
whole&mdash;there is no omniscient perspective on nature&rsquo;s path
structure.</li>

<li>We will die out before we have discovered and understood all of
nature&rsquo;s <em>d&agrave;o</em>s (&#36947; paths).</li>
</ol>

<p>
We will always wonder if our judgment about which is the best path
will be our later judgment. All we can substitute for a global,
eternal perspective is some local consensus.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Substantively, in the end, is there success and defect? Substantively,
in the end, is there neither success nor defect? If we can call these
successful, then even I am also successful. If they cannot be called
successful, then neither I nor any other thing may be called
successful. For this reason, sages target the illumination of slippery
doubt and for this reason, we do not use it and let things rest in the
conventional. (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 2:6)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The weak skeptical conclusion is most strikingly expressed in the
observation that introduces the chapter with the story of Cook
Ding.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
My life is limited and know-how is unlimited. To pursue the unlimited
with the limited is dangerous. (<em>Zhuangzi</em> 3:1)</p>

The number of philosophical articles published on Zhuangzi&rsquo;s
philosophy has grown exponentially in the years since the discovery of
the Chinese philosophical tradition. The wide range of alternative
views and approaches can only be hinted at in this bibliography.

understanding of Zhuangzi. They include (in order of publication):</p>

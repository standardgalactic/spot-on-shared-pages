<h1>Ruth Barcan Marcus</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Mar 5, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Ruth Barcan Marcus (1921&ndash;2012) was one of the most influential
philosophers of the second half of the twentieth century. Her first
1946 publication contains the first published construction of formal
systems of quantified modal
 logic.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 Her pioneering formal work in quantified modal logic contributed
crucially to the initial development of the intensional logics. It
also helped to lay the foundation for the inception and blossoming of
modal metaphysics, a fertile field of inquiry to which she also made
substantial philosophical contributions.
Marcus&rsquo;s&nbsp;influential philosophical work extends beyond
logic and metaphysics. She has published significant work in
epistemology, on belief and rationality, and in ethics, on moral
dilemmas and deontic logic, and has contributed to Spinozian and
Russellian scholarship. Her philosophical views&mdash;about language,
essentialism, belief, and moral dilemmas&mdash;are deeply naturalistic
and eschew rationalistic idealizations.</p>

<p>
Barcan Marcus was an actively engaged and authoritative participant in
some of the main and most-heated philosophical debates taking place
from the 1950s to the end of the last century. In the fifties and
sixties, in formidable opposition to Quine, she crucially contributed
to establishing the legitimacy of modal logic and thus of modal
metaphysics. Her work bridges two very different philosophical eras
and paves the way for the philosophical revolutions, in philosophy of
language and metaphysics, of the seventies. As a rare female logician
and philosopher, and of a rare caliber too, she was also a pioneer
academic, an active participant in the life of the profession,
determined to reform and improve its institutions.</p>

<p>
This entry focuses on Ruth Barcan Marcus&rsquo;s key contributions to
formal logic, metaphysics, epistemology and ethics. It engages with
the controversies in which she was involved only insofar as they are
relevant to her philosophical development. In this entry Ruth Barcan
Marcus is sometimes called Barcan, sometimes Marcus, and sometimes
Barcan Marcus, mainly according to the temporal context, in a way that
should sound natural and generate no confusion.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="Life">1. Life</h2>

<p>
The main written source of information on Ruth Barcan Marcus&rsquo;s
personal and professional life is her Dewey Lecture &ldquo;A
Philosopher&rsquo;s Calling&rdquo; delivered at the Eastern APA
meeting on December 29, 2009 (Marcus 2010).</p>

<p>
Marcus was born Ruth Charlotte Barcan in New York on August 2, 1921 to
secular Jews of Eastern European descent. The third of three
daughters, she grew up in the Bronx in an activist socialist
household. She describes 1930 as a catastrophic year when her father
died in the midst of the Great Depression, leaving the now all-female
family in economic and emotional distress but also freer to follow
unconventional paths. Marcus emerges from her own recollection as a
vivacious, unruly, athletic and intelligent child with a voracious
appetite for knowledge. After high-school, she enrolled at New York
University, instead of attending a college for women as expected. At
NYU she majored in philosophy and mathematics. Of her teachers at the
time, the most influential was J.C.C. McKinsey who, clearly aware of
her talent, tutored her in advanced mathematical logic. She developed
an interest in C.I. Lewis&rsquo;s modal systems, and McKinsey advised
her to continue her studies at Yale under the supervision of F.B.
Fitch. She started Yale&rsquo;s graduate program in 1942 and received
her PhD in 1946. At Yale, she met her future husband, Jules A. Marcus,
at the time a graduate student in physics who was, like her, an
accomplished fencer. They married in 1942, had four children, and
divorced in 1976. At the time Yale accepted women in its graduate
school but not as undergraduates. Marcus recollects the paradoxical
situation of female graders prohibited from entering the classrooms
for the undergraduate courses they assisted, and the embarrassment of
a library room accessible only to men. In this discriminatory
environment she was nonetheless elected president of the philosophy
students&rsquo; club. She reports receiving a letter from the chair of
the department suggesting that she decline as well as having to work
around the logistic difficulties she faced as female president of an
association used to meeting in a location closed to women. Her
attitude in the face of such difficulties seems to have been one of
healthy disregard. Marcus completed her dissertation <em>A Strict
Functional Calculus</em> in 1946, and that same year she started
publishing parts of it as articles in the <em>Journal of Symbolic
Logic</em>, under Alonzo Church&rsquo;s editorship.</p>

<p>
Starting in 1944 Marcus followed her husband who pursued his academic
career as a physicist. In 1947 they moved to Chicago where she held a
post-doctoral fellowship from the American Association of University
Women and took the opportunity to study with Rudolf Carnap, who in
those years was also working on the modalities and quantification. In
1949 her husband was hired at Northwestern University and they moved
to Evanston. Marcus reports that at the time Northwestern University
had an anti-nepotism policy excluding the regular appointment of
faculty spouses and that for some years she did not seek a regular
full-time academic position. She held instead various part-time and
visiting positions, while continuing to work on intensionality and the
interpretation of modal languages. In 1953 she received a Guggenheim
Fellowship. Beyond Carnap, Marcus recollects philosophically fruitful
exchanges with Leonard Linsky at Chicago University, as well as David
Kaplan who visited Chicago in those years, and Arthur Prior whose
seminar she attended in 1961. That same year, she presented the paper
&ldquo;Modalities and Intensional Languages&rdquo; at the Boston
Colloquium in Philosophy of Science, followed by a discussion with
Quine, Kripke, F&oslash;llesdal and McCarthy. In 1962 she presented a
paper on sets and attributes at the famed Helsinki &ldquo;Colloquium
on Modal and Many-Valued Logics&rdquo;. In 1964, the University of
Illinois opened its Chicago campus, and Marcus was hired to chair its
new department of philosophy. For six years, she played a leading role
in building a strong graduate department. From 1970 to 1973 she was a
professor at Northwestern University.</p>

<p>
In 1973 Marcus agreed to join and help rebuild the Yale philosophy
department, a department she describes as unsettled and uneven, but
also as her academic home, a home she never left despite flattering
competing offers and much travel for temporary positions at other
institutions. Marcus had by now built a distinguished philosophical
reputation as a leading figure in her field. Throughout the rest of
her career she received numerous awards, fellowships, and honors, like
the Medal of the Coll&egrave;ge de France in 1986, an honorary
doctorate of humane letters by the University of Illinois in 1995, and
the Yale Graduate School&rsquo;s Wilbur Cross Medal in 2000. She was
the first recipient of the APA Quinn Prize for service to the
profession in 2007, and the first female recipient of the Lauener
Prize for an Outstanding Ouevre in Analytical Philosophy in 2008.
Marcus retired from Yale in 1992, but remained active in the
profession and held a regular one-term-per-year Distinguished Visiting
Professor position at the University of California, Irvine. Aside from
the crucial roles she played in building the philosophy departments of
the University of Illinois Chicago and Yale, throughout her career
Marcus was committed to service to the profession. Notably, starting
in 1961 she served for fifteen years in the American Philosophical
Association, first as secretary and then president of its Central
Division, and finally as chair of its National Board of Officers
(1977&ndash;1983). She was also vice president (1980&ndash;83) and
president (1983&ndash;86) of the Association of Symbolic Logic. She
died in New Haven on February 19, 2012.</p>

<p>
In her Dewey Lecture Marcus recollects fondly the joy of teaching to
undergraduates, some of whom, like some of her graduate students, went
on to distinguished philosophical careers. Concerning her
philosophical style, she describes herself as a philosopher not drawn
to big philosophical questions, but driven instead by &ldquo;common
sense observations, couched in our common, ordinary language&rdquo;.
Unfond of philosophical labels, she found herself naturally inclined
to naturalistic views. Despite her active academic life, her collegial
attitude and her many philosophical friendships, she ultimately
regarded herself as &ldquo;essentially a loner&rdquo; who was
&ldquo;not driven to publish&rdquo; unless she thought she had
something useful, interesting and clear to say.</p>

Lauener 1999: 173&ndash;177, Marcus 2005 which contains an interview
on Marcus&rsquo;s formal work, Hull 2013, Williamson 2013a, and
Frauchiger 2015 which contains a biographical proem by Frauchiger, a
<em>Laudatio</em> by Williamson and an interview with Marcus.
Cresswell 2001 is a brief summary of the main topics of Marcus&rsquo;s
philosophy.</p>

<p>
<em>Note</em>: For the remainder of the entry, at the beginning of
each section (or subsection), Marcus&rsquo;s papers most relevant to
the topic of the section are listed. This does not imply that Marcus
treated that topic exclusively in those papers. On the contrary,
throughout her published work Marcus often returns to the central,
interconnected themes of her philosophy.</p>

<p>
This entry examines Barcan Marcus&rsquo;s work mostly as originally
published. It does not scrupulously track later revisions and does not
attempt to reconstruct whether those revisions simply clarify or
marginally alter the original points.</p>

<h2 id="EarlFormWork">2. Early Formal Work</h2>

<p>
This section surveys Marcus&rsquo;s early formal papers, published
from 1946 to 1953 in <em>The Journal of Symbolic Logic</em>, and
examines two of their key results: the proofs of the deduction theorem
for S4 and of the necessity of identity. The most relevant papers are:
&ldquo;A Functional Calculus of First Order Based on Strict
Implication&rdquo; (1946a), &ldquo;The Deduction Theorem in a
Functional Calculus of First Order Based on Strict Implication&rdquo;
(1946b), &ldquo;The Identity of Individuals in a Strict Functional
Calculus of Second Order&rdquo; (1947) and &ldquo;Strict Implication,
Deducibility and the Deduction Theorem&rdquo; (1953). This is the most
technical section of the entry, and may be skipped by readers who are
less concerned with Marcus&rsquo;s achievements in modal logic.</p>

<h3 id="QuanModaLogi">2.1 Quantified Modal Logic</h3>

<p>
1946 was a good year for modal logic. Barcan&rsquo;s &ldquo;A
Functional Calculus of First Order Based on Strict Implication&rdquo;
appeared in the first issue of the 1946 volume of <em>The Journal of
Symbolic Logic</em>, soon followed by Carnap&rsquo;s &ldquo;Modalities
and Quantification&rdquo; in the second, and Barcan&rsquo;s &ldquo;The
Deduction Theorem in a Functional Calculus of First Order Based on
Strict Implication&rdquo; in the fourth. Barcan&rsquo;s first paper
extends the propositional system S2, which C.I. Lewis had singled out
as the best system for formalizing the notion of deduction in the
object language (Appendix of Lewis &amp; Langford 1932).</p>

<p>
For the propositional part, Barcan follows exactly Lewis&rsquo;s
axiomatization of the system, which she supplements with axioms and
rules for quantification. Most of the axioms are versions of standard
propositional and quantified axioms, but formulated for strict instead
of material
 implication.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Barcan uses Greek letters in the metalanguage: upper case Greek
letters represent well-formed formulas (wff&rsquo;s) and lower case
Greek letters represent (individual, propositional and functional)
variables. Axioms are given as schemata, thus eliminating the need for
Lewis&rsquo;s rule of uniform substitution. Negation, conjunction, the
existential quantifier and the possibility operator (the diamond
\(\modalD\)) are taken as primitive. Disjunction, material implication
(the conditional), material equivalence (the biconditional), the
universal quantifier and the necessity operator (the box \(\modalB\))
are defined in their terms. \((A \Rightarrow B)\) is defined as
\(\nsim\modalD (A \land \nsim B)\), which is equivalent to \(\modalB
(A \rightarrow B)\).</p>

then infer \((\forall\beta)B\) from \(A\).</p> </li>

<p>
Though formulated for strict implication (\(\Rightarrow\)), most
axioms, as well as the rules, are standard for non-modal systems. The
purely modal additions are
 <a href="#axiom7">Axiom 7</a>,
 the so-called consistency axiom characteristic of S2, and
 <a href="#axiom11">Axiom 11</a>,
 the Barcan formula, as Prior will later dub it (1956: 60).</p>

<p>
The rest of the paper proceeds purely syntactically. Among other
results, Barcan proves the converse of the Barcan formula:</p>

\[\tag*{37.} \vdash (\exists\alpha)\modalD A \Rightarrow \modalD (\exists\alpha)A \]

<p>
System S2 is not strong enough to prove BF, which is thus assumed as
an axiom. In these early papers, Barcan does not discuss the semantic
significance of the Barcan formula (BF) and its converse (CBF).</p>

<p>
The paper ends with a brief discussion of the stronger system S4 which
extends S2 by the addition of its characteristic axiom
\(\vdash\modalD\modalD A \Rightarrow \modalD A\) (axiom 4 in current
terminology) equivalent to \(\vdash\modalB A \Rightarrow
\modalB\modalB A\), and includes the proof of a key theorem (XIX*)
which together with axiom 4 will be employed to prove the deduction
theorem for S4.</p>

<h3 id="DeduDeduTheo">2.2 Deducibility and the Deduction Theorem</h3>

<p>
In her second 1946 paper, &ldquo;The Deduction Theorem in a Functional
Calculus of First Order Based on Strict Implication&rdquo;, Barcan
proves that the deduction theorem fails for S2 both for material and
for strict implication. She proves this for the quantified system
S2<sup>1</sup>, but her result holds already for propositional S2, and
is independent from quantification.</p>

<p>
The deduction theorem holds for a system S if whenever \(A_1, A_2,
\ldots , A_n \vdash B\) holds for S, so does \(A_1, A_2, \ldots ,
A_{n-1} \vdash A_n \rightarrow B\), and <em>vice versa</em>.
Marcus&rsquo;s focus is on the left-to-right direction (explicitly
stated here). The deduction theorem is standardly stated for the
material conditional, but in her papers Marcus is chiefly concerned
with the deduction theorem for the strict conditional, that is,
whether in her modal systems it is the case that given \(A_1, A_2,
\ldots , A_n \vdash B\), then \(A_1, A_2, \ldots , A_{n-1} \vdash A_n
\Rightarrow B\) also holds. Her interest in the theorem is not
proof-theoretical, i.e., it is not related to conditional derivations,
which the deduction theorem justifies, and the possibility of devising
natural deduction systems for modal logics. Rather, her focus is on
the interpretation of strict implication. On the history and
significance of the deduction theorem, see Franks 2021; on the
deduction theorem in modal logic, see Hakli and Negri 2012; on natural
deduction for modal logic see Fitch 1952: ch. 3; Fitting 2007; Zeman
(1973: 197) is critical of the whole idea of a deduction theorem for
the strict conditional.</p>

<p>
Barcan&rsquo;s proof that the deduction theorem does not hold for S2
employs a matrix by Parry (1934) which satisfies all the axioms and
rules of S2, but not the characteristic axiom of S3:</p> 
\[\vdash (A \Rightarrow B) \Rightarrow (\modalB A \Rightarrow \modalB B).\]

<p>
Parry&rsquo;s result establishes that S3 is a stronger system than S2.
Barcan points out that it also establishes that the deduction theorem
fails for S2, given that in S2 the following holds:</p> 
\[(A \Rightarrow B) \vdash (\modalB A \Rightarrow \modalB B);\]

<p>
but</p> 
\[\vdash (A \Rightarrow B) \Rightarrow (\modalB A \Rightarrow \modalB B)\]

<p>
does not hold.</p>

<p>
The failure of the deduction theorem for S2 means that for some
formulas \(A_1\), \(A_2\), &hellip;, \(A_n\) and \(B\), (1) holds, but
neither (2) nor (3) does:</p> 
\[ \begin{align}
A_1, A_2, \ldots , A_n &amp; \vdash B\label{eq1}\\
 A_1, A_2, \ldots , A_{n-1} &amp; \vdash A_n \rightarrow B\label{eq2}\\
 A_1, A_2, \ldots , A_{n-1} &amp; \vdash A_n \Rightarrow B.\label{eq3}\\
 
\end{align} \]

<p>
For S4 (S4<sup>1</sup>) instead, Barcan proves the full deduction
theorem for the material conditional, i.e., for S4 (2) holds whenever
(1) does.</p>

<p>
For the strict conditional, Barcan proves the following restricted
deduction theorem for S4:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag4em">
<dt>XXIX*.</dt>
<dd>If \(A_1, A_2, \ldots , A_n \vdash B\) and if 
\[\begin{align*}
\vdash A_1 &amp; \Leftrightarrow \modalB\Gamma_1,\\
 \vdash A_2 &amp; \Leftrightarrow \modalB\Gamma_2,\\
 &amp;\;\;\vdots\\
 \vdash A_n &amp;\Leftrightarrow \modalB\Gamma_n,\\
 
\end{align*}\]
 then
\(A_1, A_2, \ldots , A_{n-1} \vdash A_n \Rightarrow B\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Thus, Barcan concludes that the proof of the deduction theorem for
strict implication goes through only for arguments whose premises are
provably equivalent to necessities.</p>

<p>
In her 1953 paper &ldquo;Strict Implication, Deducibility and the
Deduction Theorem&rdquo; Barcan focuses exclusively on S4 and
distinguishes three forms of the deduction theorem for any notion
\(\notionI\) of implication, including the material and strict
conditional:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="theoremI">I.</dt>
<dd>If \(A_1, A_2, \ldots , A_n \vdash B\) then \(A_1, A_2, \ldots ,
A_{n-1} \vdash A_n \notionI B\)</dd>
<dt id="theoremII">II.</dt>
<dd>If \(A_1, A_2, \ldots , A_n \vdash B\) then \(\vdash (A_1\land A_2
\land \ldots \land A_{n-1} \land A_n) \notionI B\)</dd>
<dt id="theoremIII">III.</dt>
<dd>If \(A_1\vdash B\) then \(\vdash A_1 \notionI B\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
In 1946 her focus was just on
 <a href="#theoremI">theorem I</a>.
 She now proves that
 <a href="#theoremII">II</a>
 and
 <a href="#theoremIII">III</a>
 hold unrestrictedly for strict implication too, that is, they hold
even from premises that are not provably equivalent to necessities.
The stronger form of the deduction theorem I instead cannot be
similarly proved and the restriction to necessary premises remains in
place.</p>

<p>
In her 1953 paper, Barcan also discusses interpretative questions. In
these early papers she, like Lewis, interprets modal systems as
designed to represent and formalize a system-independent,
proof-theoretic notion of deducibility or entailment. Strict
implication (\(\Rightarrow\)) represents this target notion. In the
formal systems, the notion of consistency, represented by the
\(\modalD\) sign, is taken as primitive, and strict implication is
defined in its terms: if \((A \land \nsim B)\) is inconsistent, i.e.,
\(\neg\modalD (A \land \nsim B)\), then \(A\) strictly implies \(B\),
i.e., \((A\Rightarrow B)\). Necessity is similarly defined in terms of
(in)consistency: if \(\nsim A\) is inconsistent, i.e.,
\(\nsim\modalD\nsim A\), then \(A\) is necessary, i.e., \(\modalB A\).
The interpretative focus on strict implication as deducibility
explains why Lewis and Barcan did not set apart the non-modal base
from the modal part of the systems, given that deducibility&mdash;the
notion the systems aim to formalize&mdash;is represented as strict
implication, which is not defined in terms of material implication. It
also explains the focus on the weaker non-normal systems.</p>

<p>
In contrast, in his 1946 paper developing a system of quantified modal
logic Carnap starts by briefly mentioning that \(\necessityN p\)
(where &ldquo;N&rdquo; is the necessity operator) can be defined in
terms of Lewis&rsquo;s \(\modalD\), but then immediately proceeds to
define all the logical modalities in terms of N and clearly takes the
idea of logical necessity as the fundamental one also from an
interpretative point of view. Carnap also distinguishes the
propositional and the functional calculus from the modal calculi
&ldquo;constructed by the addition of &lsquo;N&rsquo;&rdquo; (1946:
33). This interpretative concern leads Carnap to focus on S5 and
propels his formal semantics. It is fair to say that Barcan and Carnap
developed independently the first quantified systems of modal logic in
the early 1940s, but at the time Barcan&rsquo;s focus was syntactical
and her first published philosophical considerations (in 1953) were
still driven by Lewis&rsquo;s interpretative concerns about
deducibility, itself a syntactic notion. However, in later work Barcan
underlines also Lewis&rsquo;s informal interpretation of the
modalities in terms of possible worlds (see 1968: 88; 1981b: 279;
1990a: 232; and Frauchiger 2015: 149&ndash;150).</p>

<p>
The 1953 paper challenges Lewis&rsquo;s claim that S2 is the right
system to represent deducibility. Lewis had argued that S3 was too
strong and settled on S2. Barcan instead claims that the correct
system must be such that at least some form of the deduction theorem
for strict implication holds for it. Thus, to be adequate a system
must be at least as strong as S4. In fact, only a normal system with
the rule of necessitation will have the strength to prove some version
of the deduction theorem for the strict conditional. However, Barcan
does not elaborate on why she thinks that the deduction theorem must
hold if deducibility is to be properly represented.</p>

<h3 id="NeceIden">2.3 The Necessity of Identity</h3>

<p>
In the third paper derived from her dissertation, &ldquo;The Identity
of Individuals in a Strict Functional Calculus of Second Order&rdquo;
(1947), Barcan proves a series of results concerning the necessity of
identity in S2<sup>2</sup> and S4<sup>2</sup>, the second order
extensions of S2<sup>1</sup> and S4<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>
The paper starts by extending the previous systems by allowing the
quantifiers to bind propositional and first-order functional
variables. Definitions, axioms and rules are correspondingly extended.
The abstraction operator \(\hat{}\) is introduced to abstract terms
for properties and relations from formulas, with this axiom:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag4em" id="axiom2.3">
<dt>\(2.3\)</dt>
<dd>\(\hat\alpha_1\hat\alpha_2 \ldots \hat\alpha_n A(\beta_1\beta_2
\ldots \beta_n) \Leftrightarrow B\) where \(\alpha_1\), \(\alpha_2\),
&hellip;, \(\alpha_n\) are distinct individual variables occurring
freely in \(A\), no free occurrence of \(\alpha_m (1\leqq m \leqq n)\)
in \(A\) is in a wf part of \(A\) of the form \((\beta_m)\Gamma\), and
\(B\) results from \(A\) by replacing all free occurrences of
\(\alpha_1\) by \(\beta_1\), all free occurrences of \(\alpha_2\) by
\(\beta_2\), &hellip;, all free occurrences of \(\alpha_n\) by
\(\beta_n\) in \(A\). (1947: 13)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
If \(A\) and \(B\) are as in
 <a href="#axiom2.3">2.3</a>,
 \(\hat\alpha_1\hat\alpha_2 \ldots \hat\alpha_n A\) is the abstract of
\(B\). For example, starting from a formula
\(A\beta\)&nbsp;(corresponding to \(B\) in
 <a href="#axiom2.3">2.3</a>),
 \(\hat\alpha A\alpha\) is its abstract, and \(\hat\alpha
A\alpha(\beta)\) is strictly equivalent to \(A\beta\).</p>

<p>
Barcan introduces two identity relations (and their negations),
material identity and unqualified identity, defined as follows in
terms of indiscernibility:</p> 
\[ \begin{align*}
\mID &amp;=_{\df} \hat\alpha_1\hat\alpha_2 (\forall \theta)(\theta(\hat\alpha_1)\rightarrow \theta(\hat\alpha_2))\\
 \uID &amp; =_{\df} \hat\alpha_1\hat\alpha_2 (\forall \theta)(\theta(\hat\alpha_1)\Rightarrow \theta(\hat\alpha_2)).\\
 
\end{align*}\]

<p>
From which the following theorems
 follow:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup></p>
 
\[\vdash\beta_1\mID\beta_2 \Leftrightarrow (\forall \theta) (\theta(\beta_1)\leftrightarrow\theta(\beta_2))\]

<p>
and</p> 
\[\tag*{2.5} \vdash\beta_1\uID\beta_2 \Leftrightarrow (\forall \theta) (\theta(\beta_1)\Leftrightarrow\theta(\beta_2)). \label{th2.5}\]

<p>
So, by definition an object \(\beta_2\) is materially identical to
\(\beta_1\) just in case it has all the properties of \(\beta_1\); and
\(\beta_2\) is identical to \(\beta_1\) just in case for any property
of \(\beta_1\) it is necessary that \(\beta_2\) bears it
 too.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 From this it follows, given symmetry, that material identity consists
in actually sharing all properties and identity consists in
necessarily sharing all properties. Various other theorems are stated
without proof, including the reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity of
both material identity and identity.</p>

<p>
The following are the S2<sup>2</sup> results pertaining to (the
necessity of) identity and material identity proved or stated by
Barcan.</p> 
\[ \begin{align}
\tag*{2.6} \vdash \beta \uID \beta\label{th2.6}\\
 \tag*{2.18} \vdash \beta \mID \beta\label{th2.18}\\
 \tag*{2.24} \vdash \modalB (\beta \mID \beta)\label{th2.24}\\
 
\end{align} \]

<p>
Barcan does not take identity as primitive, so neither \ref{th2.6} nor
\ref{th2.18} are axioms. The proof of \ref{th2.6} must clearly start
from \(\vdash (\Phi \beta \Leftrightarrow \Phi \beta)\) (recall that
Barcan&rsquo;s systems are axiomatized for strict implication) and
make use of second-order universal generalization and of theorem
\ref{th2.5}. \ref{th2.18} can be similarly derived but using also
\(\vdash (\modalB A \Rightarrow A)\) (a theorem of S2 for Barcan, now
standardly assumed as axiom T) to get \(\vdash (\Phi \beta
\leftrightarrow \Phi \beta)\). Finally, \ref{th2.24} can be derived
from \ref{th2.6} using this instance of the second-order Barcan
formula (not by necessitation of \ref{th2.18} as necessitation is not
a valid S2 rule):</p> 
\[\vdash (\forall \theta) \modalB (\theta(\beta)\rightarrow\theta(\beta)) \Rightarrow \modalB (\forall \theta) (\theta(\beta)\rightarrow\theta(\beta).\]

<p>
Recall that \((\forall \theta) \modalB
(\theta(\beta)\rightarrow\theta(\beta))\) is none but \((\forall
\theta) (\theta(\beta)\Rightarrow\theta(\beta))\), the definiens of
(strict) identity. The consequent is the necessitation of the
definiens of material identity. Barcan states without proof these
&lsquo;unexciting&rsquo; results. She doesn&rsquo;t even prove the
strict equivalence of identity to the necessity of material
identity:</p> 
\[\tag*{2.23} \vdash \modalB (\beta_1 \mID \beta_2) \Leftrightarrow \beta_1 \uID \beta_2\label{ex2.23}\]

<p>
as its proof clearly depends just on the second-order BF and CBF,
given that by definition \(\modalB (\beta_1 \mID \beta_2)\) and
\((\beta_1 \uID \beta_2)\) are equivalent to \(\modalB (\forall
\theta) (\theta(\beta_1)\leftrightarrow \theta(\beta_2))\) and
\((\forall \theta) \modalB
(\theta(\beta_1)\leftrightarrow\theta(\beta_2))\), respectively. So,
by the second-order CBF (the left-to-right direction) if it is
necessary that \(\beta_1\) and \(\beta_2\) are indiscernible, namely
that they share all their properties, then it strictly follows that
all properties are necessarily shared by them, i.e., no property can
differentiate them. And by the second-order BF (the right-to-left
direction) if no property can differentiate \(\beta_1\) and
\(\beta_2\), then it strictly follows that they are necessarily
indiscernible. This result is model-theoretically guaranteed if the
second-order quantifiers range over an invariant domain of properties
(and relations) assigned to all the worlds of a model.</p>

<p>
This must have been Barcan&rsquo;s assumed reading as it matches her
reading of the first-order quantifiers (see
 <a href="#ActuBarcForm">section 6</a>
 of this entry) and is quite natural in the second-order case. On an
alternative reading, assigning to each world its domain of properties
and relations, the result holds if the world-relative domains are
constant: in this case \ref{ex2.23} can be read as stating the
equivalence between the possibility that a property distinguishes
\(\beta_1\) and \(\beta_2\) and some actual property possibly
distinguishing them.</p>

<p>
Barcan&rsquo;s focus is on the more interesting result that identity
can be proved to be equivalent to material identity (and not just to
the necessity of material identity as in \ref{ex2.23}). Their
equivalence is material (\(\leftrightarrow\)) in S2<sup>2</sup> and
strict (\(\Leftrightarrow\)) in S4<sup>2</sup> (1947: 15). The
following is Barcan&rsquo;s proof of the material equivalence of
material identity and identity in
 S2<sup>2</sup>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></p>
 
\[\tag*{2.31}
\vdash (\beta_1 \mID \beta_2) \leftrightarrow (\beta_1 \uID
\beta_2)\label{ex2.31}\]

<div class="indent">
Proof:
<br />

<ol class="notopmargin">

<li id="step1">\((\beta_1 \mID \beta_2) \rightarrow ((\beta_1 \uID
\beta_1)\rightarrow (\beta_1 \uID \beta_2))\)</li>

<li id="step2">\((\beta_1 \mID \beta_2) \rightarrow (\beta_1 \uID
\beta_2)\)</li>

<li id="step3">\((\beta_1 \uID \beta_2) \rightarrow (\beta_1 \mID
\beta_2)\)</li>

<li id="step4">\((\beta_1 \mID \beta_2) \leftrightarrow (\beta_1 \uID
\beta_2)\)</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
The
 <a href="#step1">first step of the proof</a>
 follows from the definition of \(\mID\). If \(\beta_2\) is materially
identical to \(\beta_1\), it has all the properties of \(\beta_1\).
So, if one of \(\beta_1\)&rsquo;s properties is to be strictly, that
is, necessarily identical to \(\beta_1\), i.e., \(\hat\alpha(\beta_1
\uID \alpha)\), then \(\beta_2\) has that property too. The
abstraction axiom is also needed to transform expressions like
\(\hat\alpha(\beta_1 \uID \alpha)(\beta)\) into \((\beta_1 \uID
\beta)\). Given \ref{th2.6}, that is \(\vdash \beta_1 \uID \beta_1\),
 <a href="#step2">step 2</a>
 follows from 1.
 <a href="#step3">Step 3</a>
 follows from \(\vdash \modalB (\beta_1 \mID \beta_2) \Rightarrow
(\beta_1 \mID \beta_2)\) and \ref{ex2.23}, the equivalence of identity
to the necessity of material identity: if the necessity of material
identity strictly and so materially implies material identity so does
identity, by substitutivity of equivalents.
 <a href="#step4">Step 4</a>
 combines 2 and 3.</p>

<p>
The interesting part of the proof is the first two steps proving the
left-to-right direction, where we move from the statement that
\(\beta_1\) and \(\beta_2\) are actually indiscernible to their being
necessarily indiscernible (as far as actual properties are concerned,
if the domain of properties is world-relative). This direction is the
one for which in S2<sup>2</sup> only the material conditional holds.
Barcan&rsquo;s proof of this result will inevitably remind us of
Kripke&rsquo;s proof of the necessity of identity in the opening pages
of &ldquo;Identity and Necessity&rdquo; (1971). Barcan&rsquo;s and
Kripke&rsquo;s proofs have a similar structure. We start with (some
form of) identity between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> implying their
indiscernibility, and given that one of the properties of <em>x</em>
is to be (in some sense) necessarily identical to <em>x</em> we
conclude that <em>y</em> too bears that property. But there are
differences too. Kripke&rsquo;s starting point is primitive identity
which implies indiscernibility (by Leibniz Law) but is not defined in
its terms. So, Kripke derives the unqualified necessity of identity.
Barcan&rsquo;s starting point is material identity defined as
indiscernibility, no property differentiates the two objects, from
which it is derived that no property can differentiate them. Moreover,
Kripke&rsquo;s proof is not stated in terms of properties at all,
rather necessary statements. Barcan&rsquo;s is in terms of properties,
though as referents of abstracts derived from formulas (on this point
see Wiggins 1976a and 1976b). Also, as far as Barcan&rsquo;s result is
concerned, the objects may indeed still be two if <em>I</em> as
defined is still not genuine identity, i.e., should necessary
indiscernibility not suffice for identity.</p>

<p>
Next, Barcan proves the following results which hold only in the
stronger system S4<sup>2</sup>: the strict equivalence of identity and
the necessity of identity (theorem \ref{ex2.32}) and the strict
equivalence of identity and material identity (theorem
\ref{ex2.33}).</p>

<p>
Concerning the strict equivalence of identity and the necessity of
identity, the proof makes use of the characteristic axiom of S4. Given
the strict equivalence in S4 of \(\modalB A\) and \(\modalB\modalB
A\), we have that the necessity of the necessity of material identity
is strictly equivalent to the necessity of material identity \(\vdash
\modalB \modalB (\beta_1 \mID \beta_2)\Leftrightarrow\modalB(\beta_1
\mID \beta_2)\). And since the necessity of material identity is
strictly equivalent to identity (theorem \ref{ex2.23}) \((\beta_1 \uID
\beta_2)\) can replace \(\modalB (\beta_1 \mID \beta_2)\) in the above
equivalence, resulting in:</p> 
\[\tag*{2.32*} \vdash \modalB (\beta_1 \uID \beta_2) \Leftrightarrow \beta_1 \uID \beta_2.\label{ex2.32}\]

<p>
Concerning the strict equivalence of identity and material
identity:</p> 
\[\tag*{2.33*} \vdash (\beta_1 \mID \beta_2) \Leftrightarrow (\beta_1 \uID \beta_2)\label{ex2.33}\]

<p>
this is simply the necessitation of \ref{ex2.31} and necessitation is
a valid S4 rule, though Barcan does not appear to be aware of the
validity of necessitation in 1947. She first mentions the rule with a
reference to McKinsey and Tarski (1948)&nbsp;in her 1953 paper, when
she uses it to extend her results on the deduction theorem for S4. So,
her proof of \ref{ex2.33} is more complex and starts similarly to her
proof of \ref{ex2.31}. For the hard left-to-right side, we start
from</p> 
\[\vdash (\beta_1 \mID \beta_2) \Rightarrow ((\beta_1 \uID \beta_1)\rightarrow (\beta_1 \uID \beta_2))\]

<p>
from which, given \(\vdash(\beta_1 \uID \beta_1)\), in S4 we can
derive</p> 
\[\vdash ((\beta_1 \mID \beta_2) \land (\beta_1 \uID \beta_1))\Rightarrow(\beta_1 \uID \beta_2).\]

<p>
Then given \(\vdash\modalB (\beta_1 \uID \beta_1)\), whose proof
requires \ref{ex2.32}, we can prove</p> 
\[\vdash (\beta_1 \mID \beta_2) \Rightarrow (\beta_1 \uID \beta_2).\]

<p>
From \ref{ex2.32} and \ref{ex2.33} it also follows that material
identity is necessarily equivalent to the necessity of identity:</p>

\[\vdash \modalB (\beta_1 \uID \beta_2) \Leftrightarrow \beta_1 \mID \beta_2.\]

<p>
Figures 1 and 2 graphically represent the results holding for
S2<sup>2</sup> and S4<sup>2</sup> respectively.</p>

<p>
To sum up, in 1947 Barcan proves that in S4<sup>2</sup> the material
identity of two objects necessarily implies not just their strict
identity and the necessity of their material identity, but also the
necessity of their strict identity, because \((\forall \theta)
(\theta(\beta_1)\leftrightarrow\theta(\beta_2))\) strictly implies
\(\modalB(\forall \theta)
\modalB(\theta(\beta_1)\leftrightarrow\theta(\beta_2))\). This means
that the actual indiscernibility of \(\beta_1\) and \(\beta_2\)
implies the impossibility that any property might distinguish
them.</p>

<p>
It is unclear which of Barcan&rsquo;s two main theorems, that material
identity implies strict identity or that strict identity implies the
necessity of strict identity, best deserves to be called the necessity
of identity. The \(\beta_1 \mID \beta_2\) to \(\beta_1 \uID \beta_2\)
implication moves from a non-modal notion to a modal one, yet the
starting point, material identity, can hardly be regarded as identity.
On the other hand, the \(\beta_1 \uID \beta_2\) to \(\modalB(\beta_1
\uID \beta_2)\) implication proves the necessity of a relation that
has a stronger claim to be called identity, but that is already a form
of necessity to start with, and hence requires axiom 4 to be
established.</p>

<p>
This however does not detract from the fact that Barcan&rsquo;s proofs
incorporate the key idea that given the indiscernibility of two
objects, their modal profiles will also go hand in hand, so that
necessary properties (including the necessary identity to one of them)
will also be
 shared.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
 Moreover, Barcan immediately understood her result to simply be the
necessity of identity. For example already in her Review of Smullyan
she states and makes use of the following results: &ldquo;\(N(\alpha =
\alpha)\), \((\alpha = \beta)\Rightarrow(N(\alpha = \alpha)\rightarrow
N(\alpha = \beta))\), \((\alpha = \beta)\Rightarrow N(\alpha =
\beta)\)&rdquo; (1948: 150).</p>

<p>
Burgess (2014) emphasizes the differences between Barcan&rsquo;s and
Kripke&rsquo;s proofs of the necessity of identity and argues that
Kripke&rsquo;s distinct proof may ultimately derive from Quine&rsquo;s
(1953b, 1953c, 1961) search for a simpler proof than Barcan&rsquo;s.
Kripke too attributes the simpler, more standard proof to Quine
(2017a: 233, fn. 9).</p>

<h2 id="DispQuin">3. The Dispute with Quine</h2>

<p>
Marcus&rsquo;s papers most relevant to this section are: &ldquo;Review
of &lsquo;Modality and Description&rsquo; by Arthur Francis
Smullyan&rdquo; (1948), &ldquo;Modalities and Intensional
Languages&rdquo; (1961), &ldquo;Discussion on the Paper of Ruth B.
Marcus&rdquo; (1962a), &ldquo;Modal Logic&rdquo; (1968), &ldquo;Modal
Logic, Modal Semantics and their Applications&rdquo; (1981b), and
&ldquo;A Backward Look at Quine&rsquo;s Animadversions on
Modalities&rdquo; (1990a).</p>

<p>
Starting in the early sixties, Ruth Barcan Marcus&rsquo;s work became
focused on the interpretation of modal systems. Much of this work was
in explicit opposition to what Marcus eventually called
&ldquo;Quine&rsquo;s Animadversions on Modalities&rdquo; (1990a).
Quine (1946, 1947b and 1947c) had originally reviewed her first three
papers, and the friction with Quine was probably triggered by his
initial review of her 1947 paper on the identity of individuals in
modal systems, of which he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Two relations of &ldquo;identity&rdquo; between individuals are then
defined. There is a weak one which holds between \(x\) and \(y\)
wherever \((F)(Fx \rightarrow Fy)\), and a strong one which holds only
where \((F) (Fx \Rightarrow Fy)\). Various theorems concerning the two
kinds of identity are derived. <em>As is to be expected, only the
strong kind of identity is subject to a law of substitutivity valid
for all modal contexts.</em></p>

<p>
<em>It should be noted that only the strong identity is therefore
interpretable as identity in the ordinary sense of the word.</em> The
system is accordingly best understood by reconstruing the so-called
individuals as &ldquo;individual concepts&rdquo;. (Quine 1947c:
95&ndash;96,&nbsp;emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Marcus was justifiably unhappy with Quine&rsquo;s failure to
acknowledge that she had proved the equivalence of the two kinds of
identity. The frustration is explicitly voiced in her 1960 paper
&ldquo;Extensionality&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I am not (as Quine insists in his review of two of my papers on
quantified modal logic) proposing that there be more than one kind of
identity, but only that the distinctions between stronger and weaker
equivalences be made explicit before, for one avowed purpose or
another, they are obliterated. (1960: 58)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Marcus voices her annoyance with Quine&rsquo;s original review as late
as her final, posthumously-published interview with Frauchiger (2015:
151) despite Quine&rsquo;s admittedly rather laconic correction more
than fifty years earlier, of which this is the full text:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Correction to the review XII 95(4). Through some lapse, or possibly
the loss of a second proof sheet, the reviewer missed the last twenty
lines of the paper. As a result the first two sentences of page 96 in
the review are wrong. They should be supplanted by this: &ldquo;It is
shown that the strong and weak identity are actually coextensive; even
strictly equivalent, on one choice of axioms&rdquo;. (Quine 1958:
342)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The recanted two sentences are those emphasized in the previous
quotation from Quine&rsquo;s original review.</p>

<p>
The rest of this section focuses on Marcus&rsquo;s
<em>philosophical</em> disputes with Quine, setting aside the
misunderstandings and frustrations that at times accompanied the
philosophical exchange. Yet, the existence of some friction with Quine
and its apparent initial cause needed to be made explicit before, in
Marcus&rsquo;s own words, being obliterated for &ldquo;one avowed
purpose or another&rdquo;&mdash;in our case a dispassionate
examination of Marcus&rsquo;s impressive achievements in philosophy. A
reconstruction of the history of this particular initial
misunderstanding on identity, plausibly caused by the loss of a proof
sheet, can be found in Burgess (2014); Strassfeld (2022) emphasizes
the sociological and arguably gendered aspects of this impasse.</p>

<p>
In her published work Marcus more than once voiced her overall
disheartenment with Quine&rsquo;s criticisms of the modalities, which
she felt were like a moving target impossible to pin down. The mirror
frustration that his most basic points did not come across is
expressed by Quine (1961). Still, Marcus often presents her views in
explicit or implicit opposition to Quine&rsquo;s and acknowledges that
Quine&rsquo;s &ldquo;criticisms and the continuing debate were a
catalyst for some of my subsequent work&rdquo; (1993: x). Thus, some
knowledge of Quine&rsquo;s criticisms of the modalities is required in
order to situate and better understand Marcus&rsquo;s own thought
which stands in systematic contraposition to Quine&rsquo;s on a
cluster of interrelated topics, mainly the fruitfulness of modal
logic, the distinction between extensionality and intensionality, the
semantics of proper names and quantifiers, the interpretation of the
modalities and essentialism.</p>

<p>
Quine first fully voiced his objections to intensional discourse in
his 1943 &ldquo;Notes on Existence and Necessity&rdquo; where he
pointed out that the law of substitutivity, according to which
coreferential expressions are substitutable salva veritate, fails in
these contexts. This is problematic as the law of substitutivity is
the linguistic counterpart of the indisputable logico-metaphysical
principle of the indiscernibility of identicals, according to which if
<em>a</em> is the same as <em>b</em> and <em>a</em> is <em>F</em> then
<em>b</em> is <em>F</em>. Indeed Quine identifies the two principles
(1943: 113). Clear problematic contexts are quotations, where
&ldquo;&lsquo;Tully&rsquo; has 6 letters&rdquo; does not follow from
&ldquo;Cicero = Tully&rdquo; and &ldquo;&lsquo;Cicero&rsquo; has 6
letters&rdquo;; and epistemic contexts like &ldquo;knows that&rdquo;
and &ldquo;believes that&rdquo;, where for example &ldquo;Philip is
unaware that Tully denounced Catiline&rdquo; may be true even if
&ldquo;Philip is unaware that Cicero denounced Catiline&rdquo; is
false. To these contexts Quine adds modal contexts when the modalities
are interpreted as analytic or logical. From the true statements
&ldquo;The number of planets = 9&rdquo; and &ldquo;9 is necessarily
greater than 7&rdquo;, understood as &ldquo;&lsquo;9 is greater than
7&rsquo; is analytic&rdquo;, the truth of &ldquo;The number of planets
is necessarily greater than 7&rdquo; does not follow given that
&ldquo;The number of planets is greater than 7&rdquo; is not an
analytic statement.</p>

<p>
Additionally, Quine regards quantification across intensional
operators as meaningless. For example, assuming that the existential
quantifier expresses existence&mdash;a given for Quine (1943:
116)&mdash;&ldquo;\(\exists x\) (Philip is unaware that \(x\)
denounced Catiline)&rdquo; cannot be properly interpreted, for
&ldquo;What is this object, that denounced Catiline without Philip yet
having become aware of the fact? Tully, i.e., Cicero?&rdquo; (1943:
118). Quine claims that for quotations &ldquo;this paradox resolves
itself immediately. The fact is that [&ldquo;&lsquo;Cicero&rsquo;
contains six letters&rdquo;] is not a statement about the person
Cicero, but simply about the word &lsquo;Cicero&rsquo;&rdquo; (1943:
114). Quotations induce a shift of reference, from the object to its
name, thus substitutivity between expressions that refer to the same
name, as well as quantification over names, can be reinstated. Quine
however does not extend this kind of solution to the other problematic
contexts, of which he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The effect of these considerations is rather to raise questions than
to answer them. The one important result is the recognition that any
intensional mode of statement composition &hellip; must be carefully
examined in relation to its susceptibility to quantification. (1943:
124&ndash;125)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For more details on Quine&rsquo;s criticisms of modal logic, Marcus
(1990a) offers her own historical reconstruction. See also Kaplan
1986, Fine 1990, Burgess 1997, Neale 2000, and Ballarin 2004,
2012,&nbsp;and 2021. On the Quine-Marcus debate see Janssen-Lauret
2016 and 2022.</p>

<p>
Alonzo Church, in his 1943 review of Quine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Notes on
Existence and Necessity&rdquo;, pointed out the affinity of
Quine&rsquo;s opaque contexts to Frege&rsquo;s oblique ones in
&ldquo;Sense and Reference&rdquo; (1892 [1948]) and suggested a
Fregean solution to Quine&rsquo;s concerns, namely, a shift of
reference: variables within an intensional context can be bound to
quantifiers external to the intensional operator if they range over
intensional entities, e.g., attributes rather than classes (1943: 46).
Quine, though himself skeptical of intensions, came to accept the
Fregean solution as adequate to reconcile the logico-analytic
modalities with quantification, before eventually rejecting it as
inadequate to the task. This explains Quine&rsquo;s suggestion in his
initial review of Barcan&rsquo;s identity paper that her &ldquo;system
is &hellip; best understood by reconstruing the so-called individuals
as individual &lsquo;concepts&rsquo;&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Yet, Marcus never endorsed indirect, Fregean interpretations of the
modalities, of which she said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The swelling of ontology was for Quine a <em>prima facie</em> ground
for rejection. For me the ground for rejection was the systematic
ambiguity.&nbsp;(1990a: 233)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A forced Fregean shift relative to context would itself be a criticism
and a sufficient deterrent. I took reference as univocal in and out of
modal contexts. (1990a: 233)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Her work is embedded in the Russellian tradition and she strongly
resists the claim that intensional entities are required to interpret
modal discourse. In fact, Marcus immediately subscribed to
Smullyan&rsquo;s (1947 and 1948) claim that Quine&rsquo;s problems of
substitutivity in intensional contexts are spurious. When the singular
terms are genuine proper names they can be substituted within
intensional contexts too. When they are descriptions, the sentences in
which they occur should be analyzed Russell&rsquo;s way and there will
be scope ambiguities. For example, &ldquo;Necessarily 9 is greater
than 7&rdquo; is true and any other name of 9 can be replaced
<em>salva veritate</em>. Yet, from it we cannot derive
&ldquo;Necessarily the number of planets is greater than 7&rdquo; by
substitution as &ldquo;the number of planets&rdquo; is not a name.
Moreover, the analysis of this last statement uncovers two distinct
readings: the true &ldquo;There is a unique thing that numbers the
planets and it is necessarily greater than 7&rdquo; and the false
&ldquo;Necessarily there is a unique thing that numbers the planets
and it is greater than 7&rdquo;. This Russellian solution was
anticipated, though not endorsed, by Church (1942) and will be later
endorsed by Fitch (1949) too. Marcus claims:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In the reviewer&rsquo;s opinion, Smullyan is justified in his
contention that the solution of Quine&rsquo;s dilemma does not require
any radical departure from a system such as that of <em>Principia
Mathematica</em>. Indeed, since such a solution is available, it would
seem to be an argument in favor of Russell&rsquo;s method of
introducing abstracts and descriptions. (1948: 150)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Prompted by Marcus herself, Quine eventually came to recognize this
and finally stated:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The system presented in Miss Barcan&rsquo;s pioneer papers on
quantified modal logic differed from the systems of Carnap and Church
in imposing no special limitations on the values of variables. (1953b:
156)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
However, he immediately added:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
That she was prepared, moreover, to accept the essentialist
presuppositions seems rather hinted in her theorem:</p> 
\[(x)(y) ((x=y)\rightarrow (\textit{necessarily} (x=y))),\]

<p>
for this is as if to say that some at least (and in fact at most
&hellip;) of the traits that determine an object do so necessarily.
(1953b: 156)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The real problem for Quine is not substitutivity, of names or
descriptions, but the interpretation of quantification across
intensional operators. In the case of the modalities, the problem, he
claims, is ontological and the result is Aristotelian essentialism.
 <a href="#InteOntoNameQuan">Section 4</a>
 of this entry analyzes Marcus&rsquo;s views of intensionality, names,
and quantifiers;
 <a href="#Esse">section 5</a>
 discusses her interpretation of Aristotelian essentialism. We will
see that on all these topics Marcus explicitly dissents from Quine.
But before we do that, let us be clear on the very fundamental nature
of their disagreement.</p>

<p>
One of the few things on which Quine and Marcus agree is the value of
formal logic, and they both oppose philosophers like Strawson who are
skeptical of it. Yet, Marcus sharply criticizes Quine&rsquo;s
strictures against the development of formal systems beyond
first-order logic, which he regards as philosophically unhelpful
(Quine 1990). These strictures weaken the position of the formal
philosophers and are detrimental to philosophical progress. Of her own
stand on logic, she says: &ldquo;I for one have no aversion for any
kind of logic&rdquo; (1963b: 327).</p>

<p>
In the opening section of her seminal 1961 paper &ldquo;Modalities and
Intensional Languages&rdquo;&mdash;which anticipates many of her
central insights on the modalities further developed in subsequent
work&mdash;in open opposition to Quine&rsquo;s defeatist attitude
towards the new quantified modal systems, Marcus states:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I do claim that modal logic is worthy of defense, for it is useful in
connection with many interesting and important questions such as the
analysis of causation, entailment, obligation and belief statements,
to name only a few.</p>

<p>
If we insist on equating formal logic with strongly extensional
functional calculi then Strawson is correct in saying that &ldquo;the
analytical equipment (of the formal logician) is inadequate for the
dissection of most ordinary types of empirical statement&rdquo;.
(1961: 303)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This theme permeates also Marcus&rsquo;s 1962 paper
&ldquo;Interpreting Quantification&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Of Quine&rsquo;s attitude towards opaque contexts, Marcus says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
All such contexts are dumped indiscriminately onto a shelf labelled
&ldquo;referential opacity&rdquo; or more precisely &ldquo;contexts
which confer referential opacity&rdquo;, and are disposed of. But the
contents of that shelf are of enormous interest to some of us and we
would like to examine them in a systematic and formal manner. (1961:
306)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In &ldquo;Modal Logic&rdquo; (1968) and &ldquo;Modal Logic, Modal
Semantics and their Applications&rdquo; (1981b), Marcus offers her own
reconstruction of the development of modal logic from C.I. Lewis on.
She also mentions the controversies that accompanied the early
development of quantified modal logic (QML)&mdash;failure of
substitutivity, problems with quantification, commitment to
essentialism, an intensional ontology etc.&mdash;and sketches some
replies. But most importantly, she always stresses her persuasion that
the development of different systems of modal logic, and of formal
semantics, is essential to philosophical progress on a cluster of
topics. In her view, one of the primary motivations for the syntactic
construction of modal systems &ldquo;was to give a more systematic
account of some intuitive conceptions of logical or more generally,
metaphysical necessity and possibility&rdquo; (1981b: 281); similarly
for alternative interpretations of the operators: causal, temporal,
epistemic, deontic, etc. Moreover, the formal semantics of these
systems is essential to philosophical progress on these topics:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The adequacy of such systems was generally tested against their
intuitive acceptability when translated into ordinary language. How
well for example did they fit &ldquo;moral facts&rdquo; or
&ldquo;epistemic facts&rdquo;? The development of model theoretic
semantics for modal logic provided a new perspicuous approach to the
variant interpretations of the modalities. (1981b: 290)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Additionally, Marcus emphasizes that not just ordinary but also
scientific languages employ natural-kind terms and thus seem to
require &ldquo;languages within which essentialist truths can be
framed&rdquo; (1981b: 285). In her mind, Quine is not only wrong about
logic, he is wrong about (the alleged extensionality of) science
too.</p>

<h2 id="InteOntoNameQuan">4. Intensionality, Ontology, Names and Quantifiers</h2>

<h3 id="InteExte">4.1 Intensionality and Extensionality</h3>

<p>
Marcus&rsquo;s papers most relevant to this subsection are:
&ldquo;Extensionality&rdquo; (1960), &ldquo;Modalities and Intensional
Languages&rdquo; (1961) and &ldquo;Does the Principle of
Substitutivity Rest on a Mistake?&rdquo; (1975). Of marginal interest
is also the short 1950 paper &ldquo;The Elimination of Contextually
Defined Predicates in a Modal System&rdquo; where Marcus replies to
Bergmann&rsquo;s (1948: 141) claim that contextually defined
predicates are not eliminable in non-extensional languages. In reply,
Marcus shows that contextually defined predicates can be eliminated
from modal languages if (i) we abandon the principle of extensionality
that takes materially equivalent predicates to be identical, (ii)
replace it with the intensional principle that the identity of
predicates requires their necessary equivalence, and (iii) take
definitions to give rise to necessary equivalences. She proves the
result for the modal functional calculus of fourth order
S4<sup>4</sup>.</p>

<p>
According to Marcus, there is no absolute principle of extensionality,
rather there are degrees of extensionality, and correspondingly of
intensionality. A language or theory is extensional insofar as it
reduces a stronger equivalence relation to a weaker one. For objects,
this means reducing identity to some form of indiscernibility:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Our notion of intensionality does not divide languages into mutually
exclusive classes but rather orders them loosely as strongly or weakly
intensional. A language is explicitly intensional to the degree to
which it does not equate the identity relation with some weaker form
of equivalence. (1961: 304)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Marcus holds that identity applies only to objects/things/individuals.
However, &ldquo;the identity relation does not <em>confer</em>
thinghood&rdquo; (1986b: 118). Things must exists before they can
enter into any relation, including identity. Interestingly, in the
1960s Marcus uses the standard identity sign &ldquo;=&rdquo; for
equality, and reserves &ldquo;<em>I</em>&rdquo; for identity. Classes
and attributes instead may be equal (to a certain degree) but not
identical:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The concept of identity in <em>Principia</em> is systematically
ambiguous not only as prescribed by the theory of types, but on the
same type level. In the second order predicate calculus,
&ldquo;identity&rdquo; means something different for classes than for
attributes, and has still another import for individuals. My
preference is for the alternative procedure of giving uniform meaning
to &ldquo;identity&rdquo; and to talk of attributes and classes as
being equal, but not identical. (1960: 58)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
She additionally claims that a language confers
&ldquo;thinghood&rdquo; to attributes, classes or propositions if it
allows identity to hold between them (1961: 304).</p>

<p>
Concerning identity, a theory is extensional to the degree to which it
reduces it to some form of indiscernibility, either material or
strict. A theory that reduces identity to material indiscernibility is
more extensional than a theory that reduces identity to strict
indiscernibility. Further reductions are possible too: a language with
a limited stock of predicates may be unable to distinguish congruent
objects or objects that weigh the same, etc. Additionally, the
reduction of identity to a particular form of equivalence can be more
or less strong. For example, the claim that if <em>x</em> and
<em>y</em> are strictly indiscernible then they are identical is more
or less strong according to the strength of the conditional, which can
be interpreted as material, strict or even as metalinguistic. So, her
own modal languages S2<sup>2</sup> and S4<sup>2</sup> were to a
certain degree extensional insofar as they defined identity as strict
indiscernibility. They were also more extensional than languages with
epistemic operators, insofar as strictly equivalent expressions are
intersubstitutable in modal but not epistemic contexts:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[E]ven on the level of propositions, we cannot talk of the thesis of
extensionality but only of stronger and weaker extensionality
principles. I will call a principle extensional if it &hellip;
directly or indirectly imposes restrictions on the possible values of
the functional variables such that some intensional functions are
prohibited &hellip; (1960: 56&ndash;57)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A language that explicitly excludes certain operators, e.g.,
epistemic, is directly extensional. Indirectly, languages are
implicitly extensional according to the substitutivity theorems they
endorse (1961: 306). For example, a language where truth-functionally
equivalent sentences are intersubstitutable is more extensional than a
language with contexts where&nbsp;truth-functional equivalence does
not warrant substitutivity. The less strict substitutivity principle
of the first language implies an exclusion of modal predicates. And in
turn a language where strict equivalence warrants substitutivity is
more extensional than a language with contexts where strictly
equivalent expressions are not interchangeable, as it implicitly
excludes epistemic predicates.</p>

<p>
Of particular interest is not only Marcus&rsquo;s endorsement of
degrees of extensionality, but also her tendency to treat, so to
speak, intensionality as the default position, to which principles of
extensionality are added with their concomitant criteria: the
reduction of identity to weaker (and weaker) forms of equivalence and
the elimination of some predicates (epistemic or modal). The starting
point after all is natural language in all its richness, and Marcus
(1975) ties precise formulations of the principle of substitutivity to
the search for the logical form of fragments of ordinary language. On
this role for logic see also the opening paragraphs of
&ldquo;Quantification and Ontology&rdquo; (1972).</p>

<h3 id="OntoIndiClasAttr">4.2 Ontology: Individuals, Classes and Attributes</h3>

<p>
Marcus&rsquo;s papers most relevant to this subsection are:
&ldquo;Classes and Attributes in Extended Modal Systems&rdquo;
(1963a), &ldquo;Classes, Collections, and Individuals&rdquo; (1974)
and &ldquo;Nominalism and the Substitutional Quantifier&rdquo;
(1978a).</p>

<p>
According to Marcus, &ldquo;that any language must countenance some
entities as things would appear to be a precondition for
language&rdquo; (1961: 309). Though Marcus cannot be classified as a
nominalist, given her endorsement of both classes and attributes, when
it comes to individual things she has nominalistic leanings. She
characterizes nominalism not just as insisting on only one category of
&ldquo;individuatable objects&rdquo; but also as having an
&ldquo;empirical thrust&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The nominalist&rsquo;s individuals are of a kind which can be
confronted or in the least, make up such confrontable or encounterable
individuals. They can, so to speak, put in an appearance.
Encounterability by the mind&rsquo;s eye is not generally counted in
the spirit of nominalism. (1974: 352)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Insofar as she appears to be rejecting non-empirically-encounterable
(basic) individuals, though accepting type theory, Marcus satisfies
one of her criteria for nominalism. In &ldquo;Nominalism and the
Substitutional Quantifier&rdquo; (1978a: 353&ndash;354) options for a
nominalistic account of predicates are considered, but it is not clear
that Marcus subscribes to them.</p>

<p>
In &ldquo;Classes and Attributes in Extended Modal Systems&rdquo;
Marcus develops a modal calculus for abstracts, where the abstracts
can be indifferently taken to stand for classes or for attributes.
This is not to be understood as a Fregean move, i.e., as the claim
that in extensional non-modal contexts the abstracts may be taken to
refer to classes (their extensions) while in modal contexts they must
refer to attributes (their intensions). In fact in her earlier paper
&ldquo;Extensionality&rdquo; we find the quite surprising
statement:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I am not disturbed by the possibility of equal, non-identical classes
or attributes, e.g. man and featherless biped. To me it seems
reasonable that there are many empty classes of the same type, e.g.
mermaids and Greek gods, equal but not identical. (1960:
58&ndash;9)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Marcus distinguishes different meanings of the term
&ldquo;class&rdquo;. In the first intuitive, &ldquo;atavistic&rdquo;
sense classes are aggregates or collections of objects. This suggests
the idea of finitely many objects physically gathered together and
observable. The second, more abstract, mathematical notion of class
does not presuppose finitude or physical proximity, and is tied to the
idea that classes are determined by properties:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Attendant to this way of looking at classes, is the assumption that
every property or condition delimits a class; every class may be
delimited by a property or condition; and if no object satisfies a
property or condition, then it delimits the null class. (1963a:
129)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This second notion, claims Marcus, is closer to the notion of
attribute, in contrast to the first extensional but quite limited
interpretation. For Marcus the classical functional calculus
(first-order logic) focuses on attributes, not on the too limited
notion of classes as aggregates, and &ldquo;the thesis of
extensionality must be superimposed&rdquo; (1963a: 130). Clearly, she
is not considering a set-theoretic, non-limited, abstract, but
non-predicative notion of class. Later, she will deem this last,
logical conception of classes, to be useful in mathematics, but guilty
of obliterating &ldquo;the distinction between an itemization of
elements and a statement of conditions for membership&rdquo; (1974:
229). Clearly, this last set-theoretic conception&mdash;favored by
Quine&mdash;is required to regard first-order logic as fully
extensional. On the &ldquo;extensionalization&rdquo; of first-order
logic see also 1986b: 116.</p>

<p>
Marcus&rsquo;s distinction between the itemized and predicative
notions focuses on epistemic and linguistic rather than metaphysical
features. She ties the notion of class, versus attribute, to the
possibility of observing and listing its members by proper names. Such
classes can be the referents of abstracts in modal contexts, and the
abstracts will be intersubstitutable in such contexts too despite the
extensional nature of their referents, similarly to the way in which
proper names are so intersubstitutable while maintaining their
ordinary referents. Indeed, the substitutibility of abstracts of the
form &ldquo;\(\hat\alpha((\alpha I \mu_1)\vee (\alpha I \mu_2) \vee
\ldots (\alpha I \mu_n))\) where \(I\) names the identity relation,
and \(\mu_1\), \(\mu_2\) &hellip; \(\mu_n\) are individual
constants&rdquo; (1963: 131) follows from the intersubstitutivity of
names in modal contexts. Attributes like \(\hat\alpha(\alpha I
\mu_1)\) (being identical to \(\mu_1\)) are not regarded as genuine
predicative attributes.</p>

<p>
In the later &ldquo;Classes, Collections, and
Individuals&rdquo;&mdash;published in 1974 but completed in
1965&mdash;Marcus returns to the same topic. She now uses the term
&ldquo;assortment&rdquo; for classes in the intuitive sense, reserving
&ldquo;class&rdquo; for the attributive notion, and claims: &ldquo;an
equivalence relation between assortments is never contingent but an
equivalence relation between classes may be&rdquo; (1974: 230).
Attributes, like <em>planet named after the goddess of beauty</em> and
<em>planet between Mercury and Earth</em> may be accidentally
coextensive. But <em>planet identical to Venus</em> and <em>planet
identical to Evening Star</em> are necessarily coextensive. The
necessity of the equivalence of assortments with the same members
follows from the necessity of identity for objects; and the
intersubstitutability in modal contexts of abstracts that list their
members by name, rather than describing them via properties, follows
from the intersubstitutivity of names.</p>

<h3 id="Name">4.3 Names</h3>

<p>
Marcus&rsquo;s papers most relevant to this subsection are:
&ldquo;Modalities and Intensional Languages&rdquo; (1961),
&ldquo;Discussion on the Paper of Ruth B. Marcus&rdquo; (1962a), and
&ldquo;Review of <em>Names and Descriptions</em> by Leonard
Linsky&rdquo; (1978b).</p>

<p>
One key theme of Marcus&rsquo;s philosophy anticipated in
&ldquo;Modalities and Intensional Languages&rdquo; is her famous
classification of proper names as tags:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
This tag, a proper name, has no meaning. It simply tags. (1961:
310)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The contrast once again is with Quine (1948) who endorses, and
actually radicalizes (insofar as he envisions non-descriptive
descriptions like &ldquo;the pegaziser&rdquo;) Russell&rsquo;s idea
that the proper names of the natural languages&mdash;in contrast to
logically proper names&mdash;abbreviate descriptions. We have seen how
Russellian logically proper names were employed by Smullyan in reply
to Quine&rsquo;s problems of substitutivity. But Russellian logically
proper names are not the ordinary names of natural languages.</p>

<p>
One interesting, debated question is whether back in 1961 Marcus was
already proposing, though not fully developing, the referential theory
of <em>ordinary</em> proper names which will dominate analytic
philosophy in the seventies, thanks to the work of Donnellan (1970),
Kripke (1972), and Kaplan on direct reference (1989, delivered 1977).
The answer to this question seems to be neither an unqualified yes nor
a simple no.</p>

<p>
On the one hand, Marcus&rsquo;s mention of ideal names and of making
recourse to a dictionary seems to indicate that she is still, like
Smullyan, thinking not of ordinary names, which are not defined in
ordinary dictionaries, but of Russell&rsquo;s logical ones. The use of
Russellian names presupposes a special form of acquaintance with their
referents that preserves the <em>a priori</em> status of necessarily
true statements of the form &ldquo;\(a=b\)&rdquo;, in line with the
logical and analytic interpretation of the modalities on which Quine,
Smullyan and Marcus were focused at the time. If \(a\) and \(b\) are
ideal Russellian names, then &ldquo;\(a=b\)&rdquo; is necessary but
<em>a priori</em> too. Marcus is also thinking of logical constants,
which belong to formal languages and do not have an ordinary
interpretation in a natural language. Here are some expressions of the
Russellian vein of Marcus&rsquo;s view:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We are here talking of proper names in the ideal sense, as tags and
not descriptions. Presumably, if a single object had more than one
tag, there would be a way of finding out such as having recourse to a
dictionary or some analogous inquiry, which would resolve the question
as to whether the two tags denote the same thing. (1962a: 142)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>
And to discover that we have alternative proper names for the same
object we turn to a lexicon, or, in the case of a formal language, to
the meaning postulates. (1963a: 132)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A lexicon which does for names what meaning postulates do for
constants can hardly be claimed to be the sort of biographical
dictionary or encyclopedia of which Marcus speaks in later work (e.g.,
in 1980a: 503).</p>

<p>
On the other hand, Marcus displays from the very beginning a very keen
ear for ordinary languages and the changes to which they are
subject:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In fact it often happens, in a growing, changing language, that a
descriptive phrase comes to be used as a proper name - an identifying
tag - and the descriptive meaning is lost or ignored. Sometimes we use
certain devices such as capitalization and dropping the definite
article, to indicate the change in use. &ldquo;The evening star&rdquo;
becomes &ldquo;Evening Star&rdquo;, &ldquo;the morning star&rdquo;
becomes &ldquo;Morning Star&rdquo;, and they may come to be used as
names for the same thing. (1962a: 139)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In fact, Marcus attributes to Russell himself a tendency to treat
ordinary proper names as referential, despite his official doctrine,
see for example &ldquo;On Some Post-1920s Views of Russell&rdquo;
(1986a).</p>

<p>
Given the bitter controversy that took place on these questions in the
nineties (see Humphreys &amp; Fetzer 1998, Holt 1996, and Neale 2001),
it is worth quoting in full the balanced assessment of this issue
offered by Marcus herself in 1978:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I argued that unlike descriptions, ordinary proper names function like
&ldquo;tags;&rdquo; that proper names are indifferent to scope in some
contexts of indirect discourse where singular descriptions are not;
that unlike different but coreferential descriptions, two proper names
of the same object were intersubstitutable in modal contexts; that
singular descriptions might sometimes be used as if they were proper
names which can be measured by our use of the description to refer to
the object whether or not the object had the defining properties; that
such a shift, if institutionalized, could be marked syntactically by
capitalization, <em>vide</em> &ldquo;The Evening Star is not a
star&rdquo;. &hellip;</p>

<p>
What was lacking in 1961 was a theory within which such claims could
be given a coherent account. How can an ordinary proper name used over
time by a wide community of speakers, in the absence of opportunities
for direct ostension, have a semantically noncircuitous route to its
referent. How is it possible to properly name an object in its
absence. How do we account for those &ldquo;proper&rdquo; names which
have a common use and which do not refer, such as &ldquo;Santa
Claus&rdquo;; &hellip;</p>

<p>
Kripke provided us with a &ldquo;picture&rdquo; which is far more
coherent than what had been available. It preserves the crucial
differences between names and descriptions implicit in the theory of
descriptions. By distinguishing between fixing the meaning and fixing
the reference, between rigid and nonrigid designators, many nagging
puzzles find a solution. The causal or chain of communications theory
of names (imperfect and rudimentary as it is) provides a plausible
genetic account of how ordinary proper names can acquire unmediated
referential use. (1978b: 502&ndash;503)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="Quan">4.4 Quantifiers</h3>

<p>
Marcus&rsquo;s papers most relevant to this subsection are:
&ldquo;Interpreting Quantification&rdquo; (1962b), &ldquo;Reply to Dr.
Lambert&rdquo; (1963b), &ldquo;Quantification and Ontology&rdquo;
(1972) and &ldquo;Nominalism and the Substitutional Quantifier&rdquo;
(1978a).</p>

<p>
One of the major topics of Marcus&rsquo;s philosophy is the
interpretation of the quantifiers, and on this too she stands in stark
opposition to Quine. The one thing on which they agree is that the
interpretation of the quantifiers must be atemporal: &ldquo;the
operation of quantification is more fruitfully interpreted as
independent of tense considerations&rdquo; (1962b: 256). Quine had
made the same point in 1953a. In 1962b Marcus appears to be joining
Quine against Strawson (1952) while arguing that her interpretation of
the quantifiers is best equipped to dismiss Strawson&rsquo;s
challenges. Similarly, in response to objections moved by Martin
(1962) against the suitability of logic to formalize ordinary
philosophical discourse, based on the difficulty of clearly specifying
the domain of quantification, she replies that in her substitutional
interpretation of the quantifiers no such specification is needed
(1963b: 326; 1972: 244&ndash;245).</p>

<p>
According to the substitutional interpretation of the quantifiers,
\((\exists x)Fx\) is true just in case a substitution instance of
\(Fx\) is true. Substitution instances of \(Fx\) are formulas like
\(Fa\), \(Fb\), etc. where \(a\) and \(b\), etc. are individual
constants of the language. Similarly, \((\forall x)Fx\) is true just
in case all substitution instances of \(Fx\) are true. In the standard
objectual or referential interpretation instead, \((\exists x)Fx\) is
true just in case at least an element of the domain satisfies \(Fx\)
and \((\forall x)Fx\) is true just in case all elements of the domain
satisfy \(Fx\).</p>

<p>
The substitutional account, which is found already in Russell and
Whitehead&rsquo;s <em>Principia Mathematica</em> (Marcus 1962b: 254),
is preferred by Marcus chiefly because it separates questions of
generality from questions of ontology, and in so doing it better
represents ordinary uses of expressions of quantification in natural
language. Moreover, being free of ontological commitments, it permits,
so to speak, the existential generalization of empty names: from
&ldquo;A statue of Venus is in the Louvre&rdquo; we can derive
&ldquo;\((\exists x)\) (a statue of \(x\) is in the Louvre)&rdquo;
(1972: 245); a statue of Venus (the goddess) is after all a statue of
something. The substitutional interpretation has also additional
benefits: it bypasses Quine&rsquo;s ontological concerns about
quantification in and out of modal contexts, and it accommodates
nominalistic inclinations thus allowing quantification to be extended
to other syntactical categories (higher-order and propositional
quantification) free of ontological commitments to properties or
propositions&mdash;another qualm of Quine. In &ldquo;Quantification
and Ontology&rdquo; Marcus contrasts substitutional interpretations of
the quantifiers in modal logic not only to Fregean interpretations
that require the domain of quantification to include intensions, but
also to Kripke&rsquo;s and Hintikka&rsquo;s (1963) possible world
semantics that associate alternative domains of quantification to
merely possible worlds, thus encompassing merely possible entities
(1972: 243).</p>

<p>
Marcus dismisses the objection that if there are unnamed objects then
the substitutional account of the quantifiers may verify a universal
sentence like \((\forall x)Fx\) even if not all objects are \(F\), as
long all named objects are. This is inevitable for non-denumerable
domains, given that the stock of names is denumerable. In her reply,
she points out that this criticism has no bite against nominalists who
are skeptical of non-denumerable collections to start with. She is
speaking on behalf of the nominalist, so it remains unclear whether
she shares the skepticism. More interestingly, referring to the
downward L&ouml;wenhein-Skolem theorem, Marcus also claims that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the fact that every <em>referential</em> first order language which
has a nondenumerable model must have a denumerable one gives little
advantage to the referential view. (1978a: 360)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Marcus&rsquo;s point does not apply to second-order logic where the
theorem fails, but her main referentialist opponent is Quine who
recognizes only first-order logic as genuine. So, against him, the
point seems well taken.</p>

<p>
While Quine denied reference to proper names and made the (quantifiers
and) variables play the role of referring to (a domain of)
individuals, Marcus reverses the picture. It is the names that are
referential, not the quantifiers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
On a substitutional semantics of the same first order language, a
domain of objects is not specified. Variables do not range over
objects. They are place markers for substituends. Satisfaction
relative to objects is not defined. Atomic sentences are assigned
truth values. (1978b: 357)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The substitutional interpretation is for Marcus the default, general
one. It is just in the specific case when the names in the
substitution class for the quantifiers are genuinely referential that
the quantifiers can be read ontologically or existentially, but the
direct referential link is always played by the genuine, non-empty
names (1978b: 358). On substitutional quantification see Dunn and
Belnap 1968, Linsky 1972, and Kripke 1976.</p>

<h2 id="Esse">5. Essentialism</h2>

<p>
Marcus&rsquo;s papers most relevant to this section are:
&ldquo;Essentialism in Modal Logic&rdquo; (1967) and &ldquo;Essential
Attribution&rdquo; (1971).</p>

<h3 id="QuanModaLogiEsse">5.1 Quantified Modal Logic and Essentialism</h3>

<p>
Quine&rsquo;s ultimate criticism of quantified modal logic was its
(alleged) commitment to Aristotelian essentialism, a world view that
he rejected on philosophical grounds. Against Quine, Marcus argues
that Quine&rsquo;s characterization of Aristotelian essentialism is
wrong, that modal logic is not committed to Aristotelian essentialism
correctly understood, and that in any case Aristotelian essentialism
is not to be rejected.</p>

<p>
For Quine it seems that even the necessity of identity is an
essentialist thesis insofar as it presupposes the meaningfulness of
the distinction between necessary and non-necessary attributes (as
opposed to truths). However, Marcus points out that Aristotelian
essentialism is not simply the predication of <em>de re</em>
necessities:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
What has gone wrong in recent discussions of essentialism is the
assumption of surface synonymy between &lsquo;is essentially&rsquo;
and <em>de re</em> occurrences of &lsquo;is necessarily&rsquo;. (1971:
193)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This means that regardless of their <em>de dicto</em> (in front of a
closed sentence) or <em>de re</em> (in front of a predicate or an open
sentence) employment, different interpretations of the modal operators
are possible. In her work, Marcus focuses on two such interpretations:
logical necessity and natural (causal, nomological, physical)
necessity.</p>

<p>
Marcus argues that Quine&rsquo;s characterization of Aristotelian
essentialism is wrong because the <em>de re</em> predication of
necessary attributes derived from logical or analytical necessities
does not suffice for essentialism. Yet, somewhat incongruously, Marcus
seems to be conceding something to Quine&rsquo;s understanding of
essentialism when, perhaps inadvertently, she will later state:
&ldquo;identity is an essential feature of things&rdquo; (1986b: 118).
In any case, Marcus defines a weak and a strong form of (alleged)
essentialism in line with, and even stricter than, Quine&rsquo;s
understanding of essentialism.</p>

<p>
According to weak essentialism (WE) there is some non-universal,
necessary attribute \(\hat{y}Ay\) that only some objects bear.
According to strong essentialism (SE) some attribute applies to some
objects necessarily and to others only contingently (1967: 93):</p>

\[\tag{WE} (\exists x)(\exists z)(\modalB (x\in \hat{y}Ay) \land \neg\modalB (z\in \hat{y}Ay))\]
 
\[\tag{SE} (\exists x)(\exists z)(\modalB (x\in \hat{y}Ay) \land (z\in \hat{y}Ay)\land \neg\modalB (z\in \hat{y}Ay))\]

<p>
Both weak and strong essentialism can be proved in a system of QML
like S5<sup>2</sup> with identity and abstracts, under the assumption
that there are at least two individuals. Given that \(a\) and \(b\)
are distinct objects, the property of being necessarily identical to
\(a\) applies to \(a\) but not to \(b\), i.e., the following holds:
\(\modalB (a\in \hat{y}(aIy))\) and \(\neg\modalB (b\in
\hat{y}(aIy))\) (1967: 94). This satisfies weak essentialism.</p>

<p>
Strong essentialism is also provable under the assumption that there
are two objects \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(Fa\) and \(\neg Fb\) hold
(where \(F\) is an atomic contingent predicate). In this case, the
quite unnatural attribute of <em>being F or being such that b is not
F</em>, namely, \(\hat{y}(Fy\vee\neg Fb)\), this complex attribute
holds necessarily of \(b\) but only contingently of \(a\), given that
\((Fb\vee\neg Fb)\) is a logical truth, but \((Fa\vee\neg Fb)\) is
just empirically true (1967: 95).</p>

<p>
These however are benign forms of &lsquo;essentialism&rsquo; which can
be explained away as ultimately reducible to the necessity of
universal attributes like \(\hat{y}(yIy)\) and \(\hat{y}(Fy\vee\neg
Fy)\), which Marcus labels &ldquo;vacuous&rdquo; (1967: 94&ndash;95;
1971: 196), whose necessity is ultimately derived from the logical
necessity or truth of closed sentences like \((\forall x)(xIx)\) and
\((\forall x)(Fx\vee\neg
 Fx)\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 Genuinely essentialist claims instead, like that Socrates is
necessarily human, can surely be symbolized in modal systems, thus
their logical relations to other claims can be more perspicuously
represented, but are not theorems of any standard modal system.
Parsons (1967 and 1969) further develops these arguments; Kaplan
(1986) defends a similar position; see also Fine 1990 and Kripke 2017a
and 2017b.</p>

<h3 id="GenuArisEsse">5.2 Genuine Aristotelian Essentialism</h3>

<p>
Genuine Aristotelian essentialism, claims Marcus, is sortal and
general. Neither universal, tautological attributes (like
self-identity) nor fully individuative predicates (like a full
description down to uniqueness) are essential. Essential sortal
attributes are properties like <em>man</em> or <em>mammal</em> which
no object can have <em>per accidens</em>. Moreover, not all properties
of an object are essential to it. Marcus proposes the following as a
definition of Aristotelian essentialism (1971: 198): 
\[\tag{AE} (\forall x)(Fx\rightarrow\modalB Fx)\land (\exists x)(\modalB Fx \land Gx \land \neg\modalB Gx)\land (\exists x)\neg\modalB Fx\]

Marcus claims that Aristotelian essentialism is concerned with a form
of natural necessity. Rather than being an obscure old metaphysical
theory, as Quine thought, Aristotelian essentialism is presupposed by
scientific discourse. Essential properties are dispositional
properties that an object cannot cease to have without ceasing to
exist. As an example she considers the case</p>

<ol>

<li>of a sample \(s\) of gold (\(Gs\)) which when immersed in aqua
regia (\(Rs\)) will necessarily dissolve (\(Ds\)).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Reading the necessity as causal necessity, it follows that</p>

<ol start="2">

<li>being (a sample of) gold&nbsp;disposes \(s\) to dissolve (if
immersed) in aqua regia and that</li>

<li>being immersed in aqua regia causes (sample \(s\) of) gold to
dissolve.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Formally:</p> 
\[\tag{1} \modalB ((\textit{Gs} \land \textit{Rs})\rightarrow \textit{Ds})\]
 
\[\tag{2} \modalB (\textit{Gs}\rightarrow (\textit{Rs}\rightarrow \textit{Ds}))\label{ex5_2}\]
 
\[\tag{3} \modalB (\textit{Rs}\rightarrow (\textit{Gs}\rightarrow \textit{Ds}))\label{ex5_3}\]

<p>
However, from (\ref{ex5_2}) it also follows that being immersed in
aqua regia causes \(s\), which is a piece of gold, to dissolve:</p>

\[\tag{4} \modalB (\textit{Rs}\rightarrow \textit{Ds});\label{ex5_4}\]

<p>
but from (\ref{ex5_3}) it does not follow that being a sample of gold
causes \(s\) to dissolve:</p> 
\[\tag{5} \neg \modalB (\textit{Gs}\rightarrow Ds).\label{ex5_5}\]

<p>
How so? The reason is that being gold is an essential property of
\(s\), \(\modalB \textit{Gs}\), and from this and (\ref{ex5_2}) the
necessity of the consequent, i.e., (\ref{ex5_4}), follows; but being
immersed in aqua regia is not essential to \(s\), \(\neg\modalB
\textit{Rs}\), hence the necessity of the consequent of (\ref{ex5_3})
cannot be proved, and&nbsp;(\ref{ex5_5}) holds. Thus, dissolving if
put in aqua regia \(\hat{y}(Ry\rightarrow Dy)\) is an essential
property of gold; but dissolving if made of gold
\(\hat{y}(Gy\rightarrow Dy)\) is not an essential property of things
immersed in aqua regia. There is no natural kind <em>things put in
aqua regia</em> that might ground such a bizarre disposition (1971:
200&ndash;202). On Aristotelian essentialism see also Marcus 1975/76:
44&ndash;45.</p>

<h2 id="ActuBarcForm">6. Actualism and the Barcan Formula</h2>

<p>
Marcus&rsquo;s papers most relevant to this subsection are:
&ldquo;Dispensing with Possibilia&rdquo;&nbsp;(1975/76),
&ldquo;Possibilia and Possible Worlds&rdquo; (1986b), &ldquo;Barcan
Formula&rdquo; (1991) and &ldquo;Are Possible, Non Actual Objects
Real?&rdquo; (1997).</p>

<p>
In Barcan&rsquo;s S2<sup>1</sup> and S4<sup>1</sup> 1946 systems the
quantifiers and the modal operators interact in the most
straightforward way (Deutsch 1994; Linsky &amp; Zalta 1994). The rules
of the propositional modal systems and of predicate logic are just
combined with no modification. For example, the proof of the converse
Barcan formula:</p> 
\[\tag{CBF} (\exists\alpha)\modalD A \Rightarrow \modalD (\exists\alpha)A\]

<p>
starts from the first-order-logic theorem \(\vdash A \Rightarrow
(\exists\alpha)A\), to which it applies first a modal rule of
propositional S2 (if \(\vdash A \Rightarrow B\) then \(\vdash \modalD
A \Rightarrow \modalD B\)) to derive \(\vdash \modalD A \Rightarrow
\modalD (\exists\alpha)A\), and then a standard first-order-logic rule
to get the final result.</p>

<p>
These systems are not strong enough to prove the Barcan formula:</p>

\[\tag{BF} \modalD (\exists \alpha)A \Rightarrow (\exists\alpha)\modalD A\]

<p>
which is thus assumed as an axiom.</p>

<p>
In a variable domain semantics, like in Kripke 1963, where each world
is assigned its own domain of individuals&mdash;the individuals which
are assumed to exist in that world&mdash;CBF is valid in models where
the domains of the worlds possible relative to a given world
<em>w</em> (accessible from <em>w</em>) do not diminish, that is, they
contain all the individuals in the domain of <em>w</em>, and possibly
more. Symmetrically, BF is valid in models where the domains of the
worlds which are possible relative to a given world <em>w</em> do not
grow, that is, they are subsets of <em>w</em>&rsquo;s domain. Hence,
the combination of the two formulas is valid when the world domains
are constant. And clearly, both CBF and BF are valid in simpler
semantics where one unique non-world-relative domain is associated to
a model, as in Kripke 1959 and in the semantic construction used by
Barcan Marcus to argue for BF (1961: 319&ndash;320).</p>

<p>
The addition of BF as an axiom in her 1946 systems seems to indicate
that Barcan found it a natural
 assumption.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup>
 This might have been due to Barcan&rsquo;s semantic preference for a
unique domain and the philosophical predilection for actualism she
explicitly expresses in her later work. Yet, if Barcan had semantic
considerations in mind at this early stage in her work, they remained
unvoiced. In the early papers, at least CBF appears to be a
syntactically-driven result. Moreover, Barcan&rsquo;s explicit
interpretative considerations at the time have to do with strict
implication interpreted as deducibility. Indeed, one may regard BF and
CBF in Barcan&rsquo;s early papers as BF and CBF for strict
implication as deducibility. Only later, when the main philosophical
debates around the interpretation of the modal systems moved away from
implication and logical consistency towards necessity, first logical
and then metaphysical, talk of possible worlds became widespread and
the use of the \(\Rightarrow\) operator became somewhat obsolete.</p>

<p>
In her later work, Marcus strongly supports the Barcan formula based
on philosophical considerations, and often states that her commitment
to actualism is driven by a Russellian strong sense of reality which
also &ldquo;guided [her] original formalizations of quantified modal
logic&rdquo; to start with (1975/76: 42). In her view, the
&ldquo;modalities in their primary use concern counterfactuals about
actual objects&rdquo; (1986b: 114). Marcus interprets BF as expressing
a commitment to actualism insofar as it seems to be saying that if no
(actual) thing can be <em>F</em> then it is impossible that there be
an <em>F</em>. Of BF and CBF she says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Interpreted semantically, that came to assigning the same domain of
objects to every world in the structure. Since this world is one among
them, the domain of each world was coextensive with this one. Nothing
non-actual has been admitted. (1975/76: 42)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The rejection of merely possible entities (possibilia) is one of the
few theses Marcus shares with Quine. However, she is very critical of
Quine&rsquo;s (1948) arguments against possibilia. Her main
dissatisfaction is with Quine&rsquo;s claim that merely possible
objects lack clear criteria of individuation. She interprets this
claim as fundamentally epistemological, rather than metaphysical, and
in any case indecisive given that actual objects too may lack identity
(identification) criteria (1986b: 118). For her instead the fact is
simply that these putative objects do not exist: &ldquo;It is not the
absence of criteria that makes us dubious. It is rather that what is
absent is the individual&rdquo; (1986b: 127). At times her arguments
against possibilia are mixed with linguistic considerations,
suggesting that both the existence of a material object and its
nameability require that it be reachable by ostension, namely,
empirically encounterable.</p>

<p>
Marcus concedes that there are two reasons to favor possibilia. The
first is the intuitive plausibility of the claim that there might have
been more, or different, objects than there actually are (1975/76:
43); the second is that there are some plausible candidates. These are
those possibilia that are embedded in the history of the actual world,
like a half-built house or an alternative chess move that was not
taken (a particular event). Even them however are eventually
rejected:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
These are on the threshold of being candidates for ostension since we
can trace a relevant partial history. But finally, they have no
location in the actual order. (1997: 255)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
See also 1975/76: 46.</p>

<p>
Marcus is somewhat critical of Kripke&rsquo;s variable domain
semantics:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Although in setting up his quantificational structures, Kripke singled
out the actual world as worthy of special designation among
alternatives, his syntax and semantics are as I will suggest too
impoverished to make any use of that special role. (1986b: 113)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is quite a bold claim that is hard to support, especially
considering how Kripke (1965) gives a special role to the actual world
in the semantics of non-normal systems. Her more specific concern
seems to be that variable domains open the door to possibilia,
non-ostensible entities that are nonetheless assigned to variables.
Moreover, these formal assignments fall short of the actual way in
which natural-language names are given to actual objects. Her own
substitutional account of the quantifiers mitigates these concerns,
and affords us the possibility of combining a variable-domain
semantics with a rejection of possibilia, since in the substitutional
interpretation the quantifiers are associated to world-relative stocks
of names available for substitution, not to domains of individuals.
Nonetheless, for the actual world the quantifiers can be given an
objectual reading:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Indeed we can reintroduce full fledged reference by associating a
domain of objects with the actual world and view our quantifiers as
mixed; referential for this world and substitutional otherwise. We can
thus dispense with the artifice of domains of possibilia. (1975/76:
47)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On the BF see Parsons 1995; on BF and the possible worlds model theory
see Williamson 2013b: Chapters 2 and 3. In contrast to Marcus, Linsky
and Zalta 1996, and Williamson 1995 and 1998 interpret BF as committed
to the existence of possibilia. Simchen 2013 supports Marcus&rsquo;s
actualist reading; Williamson 2013b rejects both interpretations.</p>

<h2 id="BeliRati">7. Belief and Rationality</h2>

<p>
Marcus&rsquo;s papers most relevant to this subsection are: &ldquo;A
Proposed Solution to a Puzzle about Belief&rdquo; (1981a),
&ldquo;Rationality and Believing the Impossible&rdquo; (1983b),
&ldquo;Some Revisionary Proposals about Belief and Believing&rdquo;
(1990c) and &ldquo;The Anti-Naturalism of Some Language Centered
Accounts of Belief&rdquo; (1995). The theme of the empirical
complexity of doxastic states is anticipated in
&ldquo;Hilpinen&rsquo;s Interpretations of Modal Logic&rdquo; (1980a),
a commentary on Hilpinen 1980.</p>

<p>
In &ldquo;A Proposed Solution to a Puzzle about Belief&rdquo;, Marcus
puts forward a naturalistic account of belief in contrast to the
linguistic or quasi-linguistic accounts predominant in analytic
philosophy. We discuss the main points of this short but extremely
rich paper. &ldquo;A Proposed Solution&rdquo; centers on
Kripke&rsquo;s extremely influential &ldquo;A Puzzle about
Belief&rdquo; (1979), where Kripke proposes a disquotational principle
linking linguistic assent to belief:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag4em">
<dt>(DQ)</dt>
<dd>If a normal, reflective speaker of English sincerely assents to an
English sentence &ldquo;<em>p</em>&rdquo;, then he believes that
 <em>p</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup></dd>
 </dl>

<p>
Assuming the direct reference theory of proper names, Kripke presents
his famous puzzle. If a speaker, let us say Kripke&rsquo;s own
bilingual Pierre, is ignorant of some facts&mdash;like that Cicero is
Tully, that &ldquo;Londres&rdquo; is the French name of London, or
that Paderewski was both a pianist and a politician&mdash;he may
sincerely assent both to &ldquo;Cicero was bald&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Tully was not bald&rdquo;, &ldquo;Londres est
 jolie&rdquo;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>
 and &ldquo;London is not pretty&rdquo;, &ldquo;Paderewski has musical
talent&rdquo; and &ldquo;Paderewski does not have musical
talent&rdquo;, and even to their conjunctions like &ldquo;Cicero was
bald and Tully was not bald&rdquo;. The propositions expressed by the
two members of each pair are contradictory: in the
&ldquo;Londres&rdquo;-&ldquo;London&rdquo; case we have the singular
proposition containing London itself and prettiness, and then its
negation. Yet Pierre, in the case presented by Kripke, is not
irrational, just ignorant of the fact that the two names co-refer. But
then how can it possibly be right to attribute to him contradictory
beliefs? And, Kripke asks, &ldquo;Does Pierre, or does he not, believe
that London is pretty?&rdquo; (Kripke 1979: 259). This is the
puzzle.</p>

<p>
Kripke&rsquo;s paper focuses on belief reports, our practices of
ascribing beliefs. In her proposed solution to Kripke&rsquo;s puzzle,
Marcus&rsquo;s focus switches to the metaphysics of belief. Her
solution is very radical insofar as it is not just the proposal of
some modifications to Kripke&rsquo;s theory, or the advancement of a
distinct but similarly language-centered theory. Instead, Marcus
rejects the entire framework of theories of belief within which such
puzzles emerge. In a Russellian spirit, she points out that
propositions&mdash;the objects of belief and other epistemic
attitudes&mdash;are not linguistic entities, namely interpreted
sentences, nor quasi-linguistic ones, like Fregean thoughts. They are
instead states of affairs, actual, possible, or even impossible. Thus,
her first thesis is that: &ldquo;knowing and believing are attitudes
towards states of affairs&rdquo; (1981a: 504).</p>

<p>
Her second main thesis is that, as knowledge presupposes truth, belief
presupposes possibility: &ldquo;If <em>x</em> believes that p, then
possible p&rdquo; (1981a: 505). Clearly, this is an external
constraint, one of whose obtaining the believer need not be aware.
Pierre, for example, doesn&rsquo;t know that &ldquo;Londres is pretty
and London is not pretty&rdquo; (importing &ldquo;Londres&rdquo; into
English) expresses a contradiction. But if only the possible can be
believed, it is then the case that, his sincere assent to this
sentence notwithstanding, Pierre does not believe it. So,
Kripke&rsquo;s DQ fails, and Marcus puts forward a modified
version:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag4em">
<dt>(MDQ)</dt>
<dd>If a normal, reflective speaker of English sincerely assents to an
English sentence &ldquo;<em>p</em>&rdquo;, and <em>p</em> is possible,
then he believes that
 <em>p.</em><sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup></dd>
 </dl>

<p>
Marcus&rsquo;s argument for the thesis that only the possible can be
believed is simply that this seems intuitively right to her, though
she is aware that many do not find this plausible. For example, she
claims that if she were in Pierre&rsquo;s situation, and then came to
know that London is Londres, her reaction would not be to say that she
has now changed her beliefs, having relinquished her past belief that
Londres is pretty and London is not pretty; but rather
that&mdash;despite her past assent&mdash;she never really believed
that Londres is pretty and London is not pretty, as she never believed
that one thing was both pretty and not pretty. Something else in the
vicinity may have been what she believed, maybe that
&ldquo;Londres&rdquo;, but not &ldquo;London&rdquo;, is the name of a
pretty city. Marcus also points out that if Kripke&rsquo;s and
Putnam&rsquo;s (1973) referential theory of natural kind terms is
correct, and so &ldquo;water is H<sub>2</sub>O&rdquo; is necessarily
true, then it is impossible to believe that water is not
H<sub>2</sub>O, and similarly for mathematical necessities (1981a:
509). In &ldquo;Some Revisionary Proposals about Belief and
Believing&rdquo;, Marcus qualifies her controversial thesis that it is
impossible to believe the impossible by granting that though speakers
cannot relinquish their alleged beliefs in impossible states of
affairs, as such beliefs were not there to start with, there is
something that they were mistaken about and can relinquish, that is
their (past) claims to have such beliefs (1990c: 150).</p>

<p>
One consequence of Marcus&rsquo;s second thesis is that Pierre
believes that Londres is pretty and he believes that London is not
pretty, but he does not believe their conjunction. This however,
claims Marcus,&nbsp;is not too unusual a conclusion. It is similar to
the lottery paradox where we believe to a very high degree that the
first ticket will not win, and so on for each ticket. Yet, we do not
believe the conjunction of these beliefs. Quite the contrary, we may
be certain that one of the tickets will win. (However, the fact that
in Pierre&rsquo;s case the beliefs are absolute undermines the analogy
with the lottery case). Marcus also points out that though belief
comes in degrees, assent is absolute. Thus, even if one believes that
the first ticket will not win, they may still be reluctant to assent
to this. This undermines the connection between assent and belief.</p>

<p>
One of the most interesting consequences of Marcus&rsquo;s account is
the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If we take seriously that the objects of beliefs are states of
affairs, then for a speaker to believe that <em>p</em> he must be in a
certain psychological and behavioral state relative to that state of
affairs. He thinks, behaves, <em>has dispositions to respond as if he
believed that that state of affairs obtained</em>. (1981a: 508,
emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is unclear why Marcus doesn&rsquo;t simply state that the speaker
<em>has dispositions to respond as if that state of affairs
obtained</em>, and her original formulation seems to generate a
regress. In later papers, she rephrases it as an attribution of
dispositions to respond as if that belief state obtained (1983b: 330)
or to act as if the believed state of affairs obtained (1990c: 140).
Some of these dispositions will be linguistic, like being disposed to
assent to sentences that (the speaker takes to) express the
proposition that they believe. But many dispositions will not be
linguistic. For example, someone who believes that London is pretty
will be disposed to take a trip there, if they desire to visit pretty
cities, do not mind the expense, are not afraid of flying, etc. This
basic dispositional account of belief is also further tightened, for
example to require that the sentence assented to is fully interpreted,
thus excluding sentences with empty names (1990c: 152).</p>

<p>
Additionally, linguistic assent turns out not to be required for
belief, and Marcus rejects the strengthened principle of disquotation
which she attributes to Kripke, which assumes also the converse of DQ,
or of MDQ, i.e., that if a normal, reflective, sincere speaker of
English believes that <em>p</em> (and <em>p</em> is possible) then he
assents to the English sentence &ldquo;p&rdquo;. Marcus points out
that we must reject the requirement of assent given that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Higher animals and infants seem clearly to have beliefs, however
rudimentary. To deny higher animals beliefs is as absurd as
Descartes&rsquo;s denying them pain. (1981a: 509)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
However, Kripke&rsquo;s strengthened disquotation principle is weaker
than what Marcus attributes to him; it requires not assent but
disposition to assent:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A normal English speaker who is not reticent will <em>be disposed</em>
to sincere reflective assent to &ldquo;<em>p</em>&rdquo; if and only
if he believes that <em>p</em>. (Kripke 1979: 429,&nbsp;emphasis
added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Later Marcus will claim that even the disposition to assent is not
required (1983b: 333, fn. 17). Non-speaking animals are not just
unable to assent to linguistic sentences, they are also unable to have
dispositions to assent. But if the disposition to assent is not
required for animals to have beliefs, then it is also not required for
&ldquo;normal language users&rdquo;. Even for them</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
there is no reason to suppose that for every belief they have there is
a sentence that &ldquo;captures&rdquo; the belief and to which they
would assent. (1981a: 509)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the later papers, Marcus develops some of the key points of her
dispositional theory of belief. She also considers in detail the views
of other philosophers (especially in Marcus 1990c and 1995). These
papers also criticize the very limited view of rationality, as tied to
logical reasoning abilities, that underpins linguistic accounts of
belief:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
But this language-centered account is an impoverished view of
rationality. It lacks explanatory force. Why should we dissent from
known contradictions or inconsistent sets of sentences? A computer
would pay no price for that, nor presumably would a brain in a vat.
(1990c: 142)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In contrast, according to her object-centered (i.e., directed to
states of affairs) dispositional account of mental states, rationality
does not just consist in eschewing logical contradictions and drawing
logical conclusions, but in overall coherent behavior, where what one
assents to matches their choices and actions: &ldquo;Rationality is a
feature of behavior writ large&rdquo; (1995: 129). No matter how
coherent our avowals are, dissonant behavior, where our actions do not
match our avowals, is a form of irrationality. Once assent to
&ldquo;<em>p</em>&rdquo; (a speech act) is seen as just one of the
many actions an agent is disposed to perform if he believes that
<em>p</em>, then the door is open to reject not only the necessity of
assent for belief, but also its sufficiency. Hence, the overall
behavioral dispositions of an agent to act as if <em>p</em>&nbsp;did
not obtain&nbsp;may indicate that they do not believe that <em>p</em>,
despite their assent to <em>p</em> (1995: 113).</p>

<h2 id="MoraDile">8. Moral Dilemmas</h2>

<p>
Marcus&rsquo;s papers most relevant to this subsection are:
&ldquo;Iterated Deontic Modalities&rdquo; (1966), &ldquo;Moral
Dilemmas and Consistency&rdquo; (1980b) and &ldquo;More about Moral
Dilemmas&rdquo; (1996).</p>

<p>
In &ldquo;Moral Dilemmas and Consistency&rdquo;, Marcus puts forward a
theory of moral dilemmas that eschews idealizations and takes into
account that our actions are embedded in a world that we only
partially control. Marcus criticizes the dominant view of moral
dilemmas which is based on an excessively demanding notion of
consistency. She attributes this view in some form or other to W.D.
Ross, John Lemmon, Hare, Rawls and Davidson. According to the standard
view, a moral code, a set of moral rules or principles, is
inconsistent if there are situations, actual or possible, where not
all the moral demands generated by the principles can be met. For
example, a moral code that comprises both the duty to keep one&rsquo;s
promises and the duty of preventing harm requires from us incompatible
courses of action if we have promised to return weapons to a party
whose intentions are to hurt innocents. This basic moral code is thus
deemed inconsistent. Nonetheless, the <em>prima facie</em>
inconsistency is supposed to be resolvable by, so to speak,
theoretical means. The principles and rules need to be qualified, or
ranked, or otherwise modified to iron out all dilemmas, for example by
giving more weight to the demands of benevolence than to the duty of
keeping promises. Alternatively, on a particularist view, the
inconsistency can be solved by a moral intuition that will indicate
the right course of action in a particular case. One consequence of
this standard view&nbsp;is that the agent who chooses rightly
according to the complete code (or by her moral intuition), e.g., does
not keep her promise of returning weapons to a malevolent party, is
cleared of all guilt.</p>

<p>
According to Marcus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
What is incredible in such solutions is the supposition &hellip; that
where, on any occasion, doing <em>x</em> conflicts with doing
<em>y</em>, the rules with qualifications or priorities will yield
better clear reasons for doing one than for doing the other. (1980b:
124)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is incredible because the underneath assumption that an idealized
agent, with complete knowledge and a perfect will, won&rsquo;t be
subject to moral dilemmas forgets that agents act in the real world
and that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The circumstances of the world conspire against us. However perfect
our will, the contingencies are such that situations arise where, if
we are to follow one course of action, we will be unable to follow
another. (1980b: 127, fn. 6)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Moral dilemmas are thus, to a certain extent, inescapable; and not
because of our moral and cognitive limits, nor due to a fault in the
moral code, but just because we cannot escape our condition of agents
set in a world that we do not control. But then, claims Marcus, the
demand that a consistent moral theory make all moral dilemmas
impossible is too strong and impossible to be met&mdash;in fact not
even a theory with just one principle can avoid dilemmas, as we may
find ourselves in a symmetrical situation where we owe the same to two
parties but can satisfy only one demand.</p>

<p>
This calls for a revision of the notion of consistency for moral
theories. The notion of consistency used by Marcus in her moral papers
is a &ldquo;semantic&rdquo; notion akin to satisfiability. She claims
that like a set of sentences (a theory) is logically consistent if
there are possible circumstances in which all the sentences are true,
the consistency of a moral code requires only that there be possible
circumstances in which all its demands can be met (1980b: 128).
Moreover, when we face a moral conflict between doing <em>x</em> or
doing <em>y</em>, the unmet demand stays in place. When we refuse to
return weapons to a malevolent party, we have still broken a promise:
our duty to keep our word stays in place because we could indeed have
kept our word. If we ought to have kept our promise to start with, and
could have done so, then we ought to have done so, even if we could
not have done so while also preventing harm. That we cannot do
<em>y</em> because we have chosen to do <em>x</em> does not suffice to
remove the duty to do <em>y</em>. Guilt is thus the appropriate moral
response, even when the intractability of the circumstances is not our
fault.</p>

<p>
The inevitability of guilt is not for Marcus a tragic conclusion, as
guilt and the associated unpleasant feelings play the important role
of motivating us to satisfy the second-order demand &ldquo;to arrange
our lives and institutions so as to minimize or avoid dilemmas&rdquo;
(1980b: 131). And this is what we ought to do. Even if this
second-order ought cannot be fully realized, as the world won&rsquo;t
fully cooperate, it stays in place as a regulative principle. Thus,
rather than attempt to fix a code that isn&rsquo;t broken, as if it
were a defective theory, Marcus calls us to improve the world we act
in. &ldquo;Moral Dilemmas and Consistency&rdquo; ends with the
intriguing suggestion that the choice we make, do <em>x</em> or do
<em>y</em>, when both choices are morally acceptable, may be
legitimately driven by appraisals that are not of a moral nature but
have to do instead with the kind of person we want to be and the kind
of life we want to lead (1980b: 135&ndash;136). Williams (1973) is a
precursor of the view that dilemmas arise from contingent
circumstances. Foot (1983) is critical of Marcus on guilt.</p>

<p>
In the later paper &ldquo;More about Moral Dilemmas&rdquo; Marcus
recognizes that the second-order regulative principle is burdensome
and supererogatory. It generates its own practical dilemmas as there
is some tension between the &ldquo;pursuit of a rich and fulfilling
life&rdquo; and the &ldquo;pursuit of a life without moral
conflicts&rdquo; (1996: 29). For Marcus not all practical demands are
moral demands and not &ldquo;all determinations of values are open to
moral scrutiny&rdquo; (1996: 35).</p>

<p>
Additionally, in this later paper Marcus criticizes a basic axiom and
a rule of standard deontic systems (see Chellas 1980: Chapter 6). She
finds such systems unsurprisingly defective &ldquo;devised as they
were for a kingdom of ends&rdquo; (1996: 32). In &ldquo;Iterated
Deontic Modalities&rdquo; (1966) she had already pointed out some
ambiguities of interpretation of the deontic operators and urged that
the operator &ldquo;\(O\)&rdquo; (ought) be interpreted as expressing
an obligation. She now criticizes the axiom \(\neg (OA \land O\neg
A)\) as false to the facts of moral dilemmas. The closure
rule&mdash;from \((A_1\land A_2 \land \ldots \land A_n\rightarrow B\))
to \((OA_1\land OA_2 \land \ldots \land OA_n \rightarrow
OB)\)&mdash;is also invalid given the intensionality of deontic
operators. Indeed starting from the trivial \(((A\land\neg
A)\rightarrow (A\land\neg A))\) it gives us the false \(((OA\land
O\neg A)\rightarrow O(A\land\neg A))\). Additionally, deontic
operators, like epistemic ones, are more intensional than operators
for causal and logical necessity. Even when \(B\) is a logical or
causal consequence of \(A\), it is not necessarily the case that
\(OA\) implies \(OB\), as deontic operators are sensitive to the way
an action is described. Deontic operators like epistemic ones are not
closed under logical consequence (1996: 29&ndash;30).</p>

<p>
Like her metaphysical views and her extended view of rationality,
Marcus&rsquo;s take on moral dilemmas and her down-to-earth definition
of consistency for a moral theory&mdash;which calls for a practical
rather than theoretical solution to dilemmas&mdash;appear to be driven
by Russell&rsquo;s admonition that a logician must not abandon her
strong sense of reality. No moral code can cover all possible
circumstances and no moral agent can escape the moral choices and
practical responsibilities inherent to the human condition. One last
remark of Marcus, on guilty feelings and the impulse to organize
one&rsquo;s life so as to avoid moral dilemmas, is a vivid reminder of
the attunement to real life underpinning her philosophical work:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Such considerations are particularly appropriate to the question of
the inevitability of dirty hands in public life. We want in public
life those who are moved by such feelings and who would therefore try
to avoid such conflicts, yet who are willing to take the moral risk of
entering into public life. It is in such cases that we see the tension
between life choices and moral risk. (1996: 33)</p>

I corresponded with Ruth Barcan Marcus in 1999 and then 2006. During
the 1998&ndash;99 academic year, Marcus attended some meetings of the
UCLA weekly workshop in philosophy of language run by David Kaplan,
Joseph Almog and Tony Martin. She was kind enough to read some of my
work and in March 1999 she sent me a generous and supportive
hand-written letter of comments where she also expounded some of her
views. In 2006 we corresponded by email about the Barcan formula and
on that occasion she sent me copies of some of her correspondence with
Quine, <em>inter alia</em>. Her last email to me ended with the
self-standing sentence &ldquo;Perhaps you might want to do
that&rdquo;. This I took to be an invitation to write about some of
her work.</p>

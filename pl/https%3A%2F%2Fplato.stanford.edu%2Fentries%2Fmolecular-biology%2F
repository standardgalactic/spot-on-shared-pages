<h2 id="HistMoleBiol">1. History of Molecular Biology</h2>

<p>
Despite its prominence in the contemporary life sciences, molecular
biology is a relatively young discipline, originating in the 1930s and
1940s, and becoming institutionalized in the 1950s and 1960s. It
should not be surprising, then, that many of the philosophical issues
in molecular biology are closely intertwined with this recent history.
This section covers the development of molecular biology: its origins,
its classical period, its subsequent migration into other biological
domains, the turn to genomics and post-genomics, and some of the more
recent developments. The rich historiography of molecular biology can
only be briefly utilized in this shortened history (see, for example,
Abir-Am 1985, 1987, 1994, 2006; Burian 1993a; Canguillhem 1989; de
Chadarevian 2002, 2003; de Chadarevian and Gaudilliere 1996; de

1996. Also see autobiographical accounts by biologists, such as
Brenner 2001; Cohen 1984; Crick 1988; Echols 2001; Jacob 1988;

<h3 id="Orig">1.1 Origins</h3>

<p>
The field of molecular biology arose from the convergence of work by
geneticists, physicists, and structural chemists on a common problem:
the nature of inheritance. In the early twentieth century, although
the nascent field of genetics was guided by Mendel&rsquo;s laws of
segregation and independent assortment, the actual mechanisms of gene
reproduction, mutation and expression remained unknown. Thomas Hunt
Morgan and his colleagues utilized the fruit fly, <em>Drosophila
melanogaster</em>, as a model organism to study the relationship
between the gene and the chromosomes in the hereditary process (Morgan
1926; discussed in Darden 1991; Darden and Maull 1977; Kohler 1994;
Roll-Hanson 1978; Wimsatt 1992). A former student of Morgan&rsquo;s,
Hermann J. Muller, recognized the &ldquo;gene as a basis of
life&rdquo;, and so set out to investigate its structure (Muller
1926). Muller discovered the mutagenic effect of x-rays on
<em>Drosophila</em>, and utilized this phenomenon as a tool to explore
the size and nature of the gene (Carlson 1966, 1971, 1981, 2011; Crow
1992; Muller 1927). But despite the power of mutagenesis, Muller
recognized that, as a geneticist, he was limited in the extent to
which he could explicate the more fundamental properties of genes and
their actions. He concluded a 1936 essay:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The geneticist himself is helpless to analyse these properties
further. Here the physicist, as well as the chemist, must step in. Who
will volunteer to do so? (Muller 1936: 214)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Muller&rsquo;s request did not go unanswered. The next decade saw
several famous physicists turn their attention to the nature of
inheritance (Keller 1990; Kendrew 1967). In <em>What is Life</em>, the
physicist Erwin Schroedinger (1944) proposed ways in which the
principles of quantum physics might account for the stability, yet
mutability, of the gene (see the entry on
 <a href="../life/">life</a>; see also Elitzur 1995; Moore 1989; 
 Olby 1994; Sarkar 1991; for a
reinterpretation see Kay 2000). Max Delbrueck also became interested
in the physical basis of heredity after hearing a lecture by his
teacher, quantum physicist Niels Bohr (1933), which expounded a
principle of complementarity between physics and biology (McKaughan
2005; Roll-Hansen 2000). In contrast to Schroedinger, Bohr (and
subsequently Delbrueck) did not seek to reduce biology to physics;
instead, the goal was to understand how each discipline complemented
the other (Delbrueck 1949; Sloan and Fogel 2011). To investigate the
self-reproductive characteristics of life, Delbrueck used
bacteriophage, viruses that infect bacteria and then multiply very
rapidly. The establishment of &ldquo;The Phage Group&rdquo; in the
early 1940s by Delbrueck and another physicist-turned-biologist
Salvador Luria marked a critical point in the rise of molecular
biology (Brock 1990; Cairns et al. 1966; Fischer and Lipson 1988;
Fleming 1968; Lewontin 1968; Luria 1984; Morange 2020: Ch. 4; Stent
1968). Delbrueck&rsquo;s colleague at Cal Tech, Linus Pauling,
utilized his knowledge of structural chemistry to study macromolecular
structure. Pauling contributed both theoretical work on the nature of
chemical bonds and experimental work using x-ray crystallography to
discover the physical structure of macromolecular compounds (Pauling
1939, 1970; Olby 1979; Hager 1995; Crick 1996; Sarkar 1998).</p>

<p>
As suggested in the brief history above, experimentation figured
prominently in the rise of molecular biology (see the entry on
 <a href="../biology-experiment/">experiment in biology</a>).
 X-ray crystallography allowed molecular biologists to investigate the
structure of macromolecules. Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase (1952)
used phage viruses to confirm that the genetic material transmitted
from generation to generation was DNA and not proteins (see
Hershey-Chase Experiment in
 <a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>).
 Muller (1927) used x-rays to intervene on and alter gene function,
thus revealing the application of methods from physics to a biological
domain (see Elof Carlson on Muller&rsquo;s Research in
 <a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Recognizing quite early the importance of these new physical and
structural chemical approaches to biology, Warren Weaver, then the
director of the Natural Sciences section of the Rockefeller
Foundation, introduced the term &ldquo;molecular biology&rdquo; in a
1938 report to the Foundation. Weaver wrote,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
And gradually there is coming into being a new branch of
science&mdash;molecular biology&mdash;which is beginning to uncover
many secrets concerning the ultimate units of the living
cell&hellip;.in which delicate modern techniques are being used to
investigate ever more minute details of certain life processes (quoted
in Olby 1994: 442).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But perhaps a more telling account of the term&rsquo;s origin came
from Francis Crick, who said he started calling himself a molecular
biologist because:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
when inquiring clergymen asked me what I did, I got tired of
explaining that I was a mixture of crystallographer, biophysicist,
biochemist, and geneticist, an explanation which in any case they
found too hard to grasp. (quoted in Stent 1969: 36)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This brief recapitulation of the origins of molecular biology reflects
themes addressed by philosophers, such as reduction (see
 <a href="#Redu">Section 3.1</a>),
 the concept of the gene (see
 <a href="#Gene">Section 2.3</a>),
 and experimentation (see
 <a href="#Expe">Section 3.4</a>).
 For Schroedinger, biology was to be reduced to the more fundamental
principles of physics, while Delbrueck instead resisted such a
reduction and sought what made biology unique. Muller&rsquo;s shift
from Mendelian genetics to the study of gene structure raises the
question of the relation between the gene concepts found in those
separate fields of genetics. And the import of experimental methods
from physics to biology raised the question of the relation between
those disciplines.</p>

<h3 id="ClasPeri">1.2 Classical Period</h3>

<p>
Molecular biology&rsquo;s classical period began in 1953, with James
Watson and Francis Crick&rsquo;s discovery of the double helical
structure of DNA (Watson and Crick 1953a,b). Watson and Crick&rsquo;s
scientific relationship unified the various disciplinary approaches
discussed above: Watson, a student of Luria and the phage group,
recognized the need to utilize crystallography to elucidate the
structure of DNA; Crick, a physicist enticed by Schroedinger&rsquo;s
<em>What is Life?</em> to turn to biology, became trained in, and
contributed to the theory of x-ray crystallography. At Cambridge
University, Watson and Crick found that they shared an interest in
genes and the structure of DNA.</p>

<p>
Watson and Crick collaborated to build a model of the double helical
structure of DNA, with its two helical strands held together by
hydrogen-bonded base pairs (Olby 1994). They made extensive use of
data from x-ray crystallography work on DNA by Maurice Wilkins and
Rosalind Franklin at King&rsquo;s College, London, appallingly without
Franklin&rsquo;s permission or even knowledge (Maddox 2002),
Crick&rsquo;s theoretical work on crystallography (Crick 1988), and
the model building techniques pioneered by Pauling (de Chadarevian
2002; Judson 1996; Olby 1970, 1994, 2009).</p>

<p>
With the structure of DNA in hand, molecular biology shifted its focus
to how the double helical structure aided elucidation of the
mechanisms of genetic replication and function, the keys to
understanding the role of genes in heredity (see the entries on
 <a href="../replication/">replication and reproduction</a>
 and
 <a href="../inheritance-systems/">inheritance systems</a>).
 This subsequent research was guided by the notion that the gene was
an <em>informational</em> molecule. According to Lily Kay,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Up until around 1950 molecular biologists&hellip;described genetic
mechanisms without ever using the term <em>information</em>. (Kay
2000: 328)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
&ldquo;Information&rdquo; replaced earlier talk of biological
&ldquo;specificity&rdquo;. Watson and Crick&rsquo;s second paper of
1953, which discussed the genetical implications of their recently
discovered (Watson and Crick 1953a) double-helical structure of DNA,
used both &ldquo;code&rdquo; and &ldquo;information&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip;it therefore seems likely that the precise sequence of the
bases is the <em>code</em> which carries the genetical
<em>information</em>&hellip;. (Watson and Crick 1953b: 244, emphasis
added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In 1958, Francis Crick used and characterized the concept of
<em>information</em> in the context of stating the &ldquo;central
dogma&rdquo; of molecular biology. Crick characterized the central
dogma as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
This states that once &ldquo;information&rdquo; has passed into
protein <em>it cannot get out again</em>. In more detail, the transfer
of information from nucleic acid to nucleic acid, or from nucleic acid
to protein may be possible, but transfer from protein to protein, or
from protein to nucleic acid is impossible. Information here means the
precise determination of sequence, either of bases in the nucleic acid
or of amino acid residues in the protein. (Crick 1958: 152&ndash;153,
emphasis in original)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is important not to confuse the genetic code and genetic
information. The genetic code refers to the relation between three
bases of DNA, called a &ldquo;codon&rdquo;, and one amino acid. Tables
available in molecular biology textbooks (e.g., Watson et al. 1988:
frontispiece) show the relation between 64 codons and 20 amino acids.
For example, CAC codes for histidine. Only a few exceptions for these
coding relations have been found, in a few anomalous cases (see the
list in a small table in Alberts et al. 2002: 814). In contrast,
genetic information refers to the linear sequence of codons along the
DNA, which (in the simplest case) are transcribed to messenger RNA,
which are translated to linearly order the amino acids in a
protein.</p>

<p>
With the genetic code elucidated and the relationship between genes
and their molecular products traced, it seemed in the late 1960s that
the concept of the gene was secure in its connection between gene
structure and gene function. The machinery of protein synthesis
translated the coded information in the linear order of nucleic acid
bases into the linear order of amino acids in a protein. However, such
&ldquo;colinear&rdquo; simplicity did not persist. In the late 1970s,
a series of discoveries by molecular biologists complicated the
straightforward relationship between a single, continuous DNA sequence
and its protein product. Overlapping genes were discovered (Barrell et
al. 1976); such genes were considered &ldquo;overlapping&rdquo;
because two different amino acid chains might be read from the same
stretch of nucleic acids by starting from different points on the DNA
sequence. And split genes were found (Berget et al. 1977; Chow et al.
1977). In contrast to the colinearity hypothesis that a continuous
nucleic acid sequence generated an amino acid chain, it became
apparent that stretches of DNA were often split between coding regions
(exons) and non-coding regions (introns). Moreover, the exons might be
separated by vast portions of this non-coding, supposedly &ldquo;junk
DNA&rdquo;. The distinction between exons and introns became even more
complicated when alternative splicing was discovered the following
year (Berk and Sharp 1978). A series of exons could be spliced
together in a variety of ways, thus generating a variety of molecular
products. Discoveries such as overlapping genes, split genes, and
alternative splicing forced molecular biologists to rethink their
understanding of what actually made a gene&hellip;a gene (Portin 1993;
for a survey of such complications see Gerstein et al. 2007: Table
1).</p>

<p>
In parallel with the elucidation of the mechanisms of replication,
transcription and translation, DNA cloning techniques allowing
researchers to isolate and amplify specific genes from the rest of the
cell&rsquo;s genome were developed. In the 1960s, the study of the
molecular mechanisms through which bacteria restricted the growth of
bacteriophages led to the discovery of restriction endonucleases
(enzymes that cleave DNA at specific sequences) by Werner Arber,
Daniel Nathans and Hamilton O. Smith. The subsequent discovery of DNA
ligase made it possible to insert fragments generated by restriction
enzymes into vectors, such as bacteriophages or plasmids, and produce
large quantities of recombinant DNA molecules in bacterial cultures.
In turn, the sequencing of recombinant DNA provided the first clues
about possible protein products and their biological function.</p>

<p>
With the advent of genetic engineering techniques in the 1970s and
80s, it further became possible to directly test hypotheses about the
biological function of genes and their products. When mutated versions
of genes are introduced into cells and multicellular organisms,
changes in specific biological activities are often observed (Craver
and Darden 2013). Loss-of-function (knockout) mutations demonstrate
that a DNA sequence and the protein or RNA products associated with
that sequence are necessary for biological activity. Gain-of-function
(over-expression) mutations further demonstrate that the genomic
sequence and its products not only contribute to biological activity
but are also rate-limiting. Evidence for biological relevance from
genetic engineering experiments played an important role in
establishing a molecular biology of the cell distinct from both
genetics and biochemistry. Classical genetics could only show that
specific genetic loci are associated with specific phenotypes, while
molecular genetics further elucidated the molecular basis of the gene
and the general mechanisms through which the genetic material is
expressed as biochemically active products. Biochemical analysis of
genes and gene products revealed that DNA, RNA and proteins display
specific patterns of chemical activity, such as affinity for other
molecules, without necessarily showing that chemical activity, as
demonstrated in a test tube, has a biological function. The molecular
biology of the cell combined genetics and biochemistry, providing
evidence that DNA sequences and molecular interactions make a
difference to biological activity in the context of the living
organism (Bechtel 2006; Matlin 2022).</p>

<p>
These developments in molecular biology have received philosophical
scrutiny. Molecular biologists sought to discover <em>mechanisms</em>
(see
 <a href="#Mech">Section 2.1</a>),
 drawing the attention of philosophers to this concept. Also,
conceptualizing DNA as an <em>informational</em> molecule (see
 <a href="#Info">Section 2.2</a>)
 was a move that philosophers have subjected to critical scrutiny.
Finally, the concept of the <em>gene</em> (see
 <a href="#Gene">Section 2.3</a>)
 itself has intrigued philosophers. Complex molecular mechanisms, such
as alternative splicing, have obligated philosophers to consider to
what the term &ldquo;gene&rdquo; actually refers. Experimentation also
figured prominently in the classical period (see
 <a href="#Expe">Section 3.4</a>);
 Matthew Meselson and Frank Stahl utilized bacteria grown with
different weights combined with centrifugation to determine how DNA,
as modeled by Watson and Crick, was replicated (Meselson and Stahl
1958; see also The Semi-Conservative Replication of DNA in
 <a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="GoinMole">1.3 Going Molecular</h3>

<p>
In a 1963 letter to Max Perutz, molecular biologist Sydney Brenner
foreshadowed what would be molecular biology&rsquo;s next intellectual
migration:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is now widely realized that nearly all the &ldquo;classical&rdquo;
problems of molecular biology have either been solved or will be
solved in the next decade&hellip;. Because of this, I have long felt
that the future of molecular biology lies in the extension of research
to other fields of biology, notably development and the nervous
system. (Brenner, letter to Perutz, 1963)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Along with Brenner, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, many of the
leading molecular biologists from the classical period redirected
their research agendas, utilizing the newly developed molecular
techniques to investigate unsolved problems in other fields. Francois
Jacob, Jacques Monod and their colleagues used the bacteria
<em>Escherichia coli</em> to investigate how environmental conditions
impact gene expression and regulation (Jacob and Monod 1961; discussed
in Craver and Darden 2013; Morange 1998: Ch. 14; Schaffner 1974a;
Weber 2005; see also the entries on
 <a href="../biology-developmental/">developmental biology</a>
 and theories of biological development [link here to entries
&ldquo;developmental biology&rdquo; and &ldquo;theories of biological
development&rdquo;). The study of behavior and the nervous system also
lured some molecular biologists. Finding appropriate model organisms
that could be subjected to molecular genetic analyses proved
challenging. Returning to the fruit flies used in Mendelian genetics,
Seymour Benzer induced behavioral mutations in <em>Drosophila</em> as
a &ldquo;genetic scalpel&rdquo; to investigate the pathways from genes
to behavior (Benzer 1968; Weiner 1999). And at Cambridge, Sydney
Brenner developed the nematode worm, <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em>,
to study the nervous system, as well as the genetics of behavior
(Brenner 1973, 2001; Ankeny 2000; Brown 2003). In subsequent decades,
the study of cells was transformed from descriptive cytology into
molecular cell biology (Alberts et al. 1983; Alberts et al. 2002;
Alberts et al. 2022; Bechtel 2006; Matlin 2022; see also the entry on
philosophy of cell biology [link here to entry &ldquo;philosophy of
cell biology&rdquo;). The immunological relationship between
antibodies and antigens was recharacterized at the molecular level
(Podolsky and Tauber 1997; Schaffner 1993; see also the entry on the
 <a href="../immunology/">philosophy of immunology</a>).
 And the study of oncogenes in cancer research as well as the
molecular bases of mental illness were examples of advances in
molecular medicine (Morange 1997b; see also the entry on
 <a href="../psychiatry/">philosophy of psychiatry</a>).</p>
 
<p>
While some authors deplored the disconnect between molecular and
evolutionary biology throughout much of the 20<sup>th</sup> century
(Mayr 1985), the past three decades have been marked by a growing
interdisciplinary collaboration which proved beneficial for both
branches of biology. Molecular genomics supplied new phylogenetic
methods for the comparison of DNA sequences and whole genomes, while
molecular systematics sought to research the evolution of the genetic
code as well as the rates of that evolutionary process by comparing
similarities and differences between molecules (Dietrich 1998; see
also the entries on
 <a href="../evolution/">.evolution</a>,
 evolution and development [link here to entry &ldquo;evolution and
development&rdquo;],
 <a href="../heredity/">heritability</a>,
 and
 <a href="../adaptationism/">adaptationism</a>).
 In turn, comparative phylogenetic studies corroborated a key
assumption guiding research in molecular biology, namely the belief
that, despite an astonishing phenotypic diversity, living things are
similar at a molecular level, such that by studying a handful of model
organisms sampling the main branches of the evolutionary &lsquo;tree
of life&rsquo; it is possible to gain generally applicable knowledge.
Evolutionary evidence in favor of the molecular unity of life
assumption has addressed some of the earlier criticisms of
extrapolative practices based on the belief that many species are
fundamentally similar (Logan 2002; W&uuml;rbel 2002). Evolutionary
biology has also had an important impact on cancer research, prompting
a shift in paradigm from &ldquo;cancer as a genetic disease,&rdquo;
which was largely motivated by the discovery of oncogenes and tumor
suppressor genes, to a broader &ldquo;cancer as a microevolutionary
process&rdquo; conceptual framework (Okasha 2021; Plutynski 2018;
Pradeu et al. 2023; see also entry on cancer [link here to entry
&ldquo;cancer&rdquo;].</p>

<p>
This process of &ldquo;going molecular&rdquo; thus generally amounted
to using experimental methods from molecular biology to examine
complex phenomena (be it gene regulation, behavior, or evolution) at
the molecular level. The molecularization of many fields introduced a
range of issues of interest to philosophers. The practice of
generalizing findings from model organisms raised questions about the
validation, limits and potential pitfalls of extrapolative inferences
in both basic science and clinical research (see
 <a href="#Extr">Section 3.3</a>).
 And the reductive techniques of molecular biology raised questions
about whether scientific investigations should always strive to reduce
to lower and lower levels (see
 <a href="#Redu">Section 3.1</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="GoinGenoPostGeno">1.4 Going Genomic and Post-Genomic</h3>

<p>
In the 1970s, as many of the leading molecular biologists were
migrating into other fields, molecular biology itself was going
genomic (see the entry on
 <a href="../genomics/">genomics and postgenomics</a>).
 The genome is a collection of nucleic acid base pairs within an
organism&rsquo;s cells (adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T) and
cytosine (C) with guanine (G)). The number of base pairs varies widely
among species. For example, the infection-causing <em>Haemophilus
influenzae</em> (the first bacterial genome to be sequenced) has
roughly 1.9 million base pairs in its genome (Fleischmann et al.
1995), while the infection-catching <em>Homo sapiens</em> carries more
than 3 billion base pairs in its genome (International Human Genome
Sequencing Consortium 2001, Venter et al. 2001). The history of
genomics is the history of the development and use of new experimental
and computational methods for producing, storing, and interpreting
such sequence data (Ankeny 2003; Stevens 2013).</p>

<p>
Frederick Sanger played a seminal role in initiating such
developments, creating influential DNA sequencing techniques in the
1950s and 1960s (Saiki et al. 1985; for historical treatments see
Sanger 1988; Judson 1992; Culp 1995; Rabinow 1996; Morange 1998; de
Chadarevian 2002; Little 2003; Garcia-Sancho 2012; Sanger Method of
DNA Sequencing in
 <a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>).
 Equally important was Edwin Southern&rsquo;s development of a method
to detect specific sequences of DNA in DNA samples (Southern 1975).
The Southern Blot, as it came to be known, starts by digesting a
strand of DNA into many small DNA fragments; those fragments are then
separated (in a process called gel electrophoresis) based on size,
placed on filter paper which &ldquo;blots&rdquo; the DNA fragments on
to a new medium, and then chemically labeled with DNA probes; the
probes then allow for identification and visualization of the DNA
fragments (see also The Southern Blot in
 <a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>).
 Playing off the &ldquo;southern&rdquo; homonym, subsequent blotting
techniques that detect RNA and proteins came to be called Northern
blotting and Western blotting.</p>

<p>
In the mid-1980s, after the development of sequencing techniques, the
United States Department of Energy (DoE) originated a project to
sequence the human genome (initially as part of a larger plan to
determine the impact of radiation on the human genome induced by the
Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings). The resulting Human Genome Project
(HGP) managed jointly by the DoE and the United States National
Institutes of Health (NIH), utilized both existent sequencing
methodologies and introduced new ones (Kevles and Hood 1992, see also
the entry on
 <a href="../human-genome/">the human genome project</a>).
 While the human genome project received most of the public attention,
thousands of genomes have been sequenced to date, including the cat
(Pontius et al. 2007), the mouse (Waterson et al. 2002), rice (Goff et
al. 2002) and a flock of bird genomes (Zhang et al. 2014). The
increased attention to sequencing genomes encouraged several
disciplines to &ldquo;go genomic&rdquo;, including behavioral genetics
(Plomin et al. 2003), developmental biology (Srinivasan and Sommer
2002), cell biology (Taniguchi et al. 2002), and evolutionary biology
(Ohta and Kuroiwa 2002). What&rsquo;s more, genomics was
institutionalized with textbooks (Cantor and Smith 1999) and journals,
such as <em>Genome Biology</em> and <em>Genome Research</em>. And the
human genome project itself turned its attention from a standardized
human genome to variation between genomes in the form of the Human
Genome Diversity Initiative (Gannett 2003), the HapMap Project
(International HapMap Consortium 2003), and the 1000 Genomes Project
(Siva 2008).</p>

<p>
One of the most surprising results of genome sequencing projects was
the total number of genes (defined in this context as stretches of DNA
that code for a protein product) found in the organisms. The human
genome contains 20,000 to 25,000 genes, the cat contains 20,285 genes,
the mouse 24,174, and rice 32,000 to 50,000. In contrast to early
assumptions, it turned out that neither organismal complexity nor even
position on the food chain was predictive of gene-number (Baedke 2018;
Brigandt, Green, and O&rsquo;Malley 2017; Green 2017) (see the entry
on
 <a href="../genomics/">genomics and postgenomics</a>).
 A related challenge was making sense of the genetic similarity
claims. For example, how to interpret the finding that human and
pumpkin genomes are 75% similar? Does this finding tell us anything
substantive about our overall similarity to pumpkins (Piotrowska
2009)? These challenges led many researchers to focus more closely on
non-coding regulatory sequences and genome expression regulation as an
alternative explanation of organismal complexity (Morange 2006). This
&ldquo;post-genomic&rdquo; approach utilizes the sequence information
provided by genomics but then situates it in an analysis of all the
other entities and activities involved in the mechanisms of
transcription (transcriptomics), regulation (regulomics), metabolism
(metabolomics), and expression (proteomics). (See ENCODE Project
Consortium 2012; Germain et al. 2014; (see also the entry on
 <a href="../systems-synthetic-biology/">philosophy of systems and synthetic biology</a>).</p>
 
<p>
In addition to DNA-binding proteins, RNA molecules that are not
transcribed into protein products play an important role in both the
regulation of protein-coding genes and in protecting the genome from
viruses and transposons. RNA interference (RNAi) are short
single-stranded RNAs that selectively bind other RNA molecules,
inhibiting their translation into proteins. Similar small noncoding
RNAs are part of a defense mechanism, known as CRISPR, which protects
bacteria against invading viruses. Non-coding RNA has become an
extremely powerful experimental tool that allows researchers to
specifically and reversibly inactivate any gene of interest. In
particular, CRISPR systems have been adapted for use in eukaryotic
cells, where they have become the method of choice for genome
manipulation (Doudna and Charpentier 2014). On a conceptual level, the
fact that developmental complexity correlates with an increase in
non-coding sequences, as opposed to protein-coding sequences, led some
authors to conclude that &ldquo;the original conception of genetic
information was deficient and that most genes in complex organisms
specify regulatory RNAs&rdquo; (Mattick 2023).</p>

<p>
Advances in genomics were largely dependent on the development of new
techniques, some of which capitalized on discoveries generated within
molecular biology, while others imported knowledge from other
disciplines. The discovery of viral reverse transcriptases converting
RNA into DNA by Howard M. Temin, Renato Dulbecco and David Baltimore
in the 1970s paved the way to the development of complementary DNA, or
cDNA, libraries containing only DNA sequences that are transcribed
into mRNA. Not only did this technique revolutionize the study of
genomes, but it also provided a first insight into what was later to
become RNomics, or the study of global transcription profiles of
cells. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), developed by Kary B. Mullis in
1983, made use of heat-stable DNA polymerases from thermophilic
bacteria to clone DNA in vitro, greatly simplifying and accelerating
the cloning process. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) combines the two techniques and is currently used to monitor
gene expression, cloning, diagnosis, and forensics. Second generation
sequencing technologies combining fluorescent tagging with traditional
dideoxy sequencing were likewise instrumental in the proliferation of
genome projects. These new techniques reduced cost and time
significantly, propelling molecular biology into the realm of
&ldquo;big data&rdquo; (Leonelli 2016). Finally, with an increase in
the number of sequenced genomes came an increased need and interest in
bioinformatics and the development of genome annotation techniques
(Griffiths and Stotz 2013).</p>

<p>
Developments in genomics and post-genomics have sparked a number of
philosophical questions about molecular biology. Since the genome
requires a vast array of other mechanisms to facilitate the generation
of a protein product, can DNA really be causally prioritized (see
 <a href="#Gene">Section 2.3</a>)?
 Similarly, in the face of such interdependent mechanisms involved in
transcription, regulation, and expression, can DNA alone be privileged
as the bearer of hereditary information, or is information distributed
across all such entities and activities (see
 <a href="#Info">Section 2.2</a>)?
 And is it appropriate to extrapolate from information about other
species&rsquo; genomes to how the human genome operates (see
 <a href="#Extr">Section 3.3</a>)?</p>
 
<h3 id="ReceExpeConcDeve">1.5 Recent Experimental and Conceptual Developments</h3>

<p>
In addition to the experimental and computational techniques that made
possible large scale &ldquo;omics&rdquo; projects, many other
innovations shaped recent research in molecular biology. Unlike x-ray
crystallography, which requires crystalline samples, newly developed
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and cryo-electron
microscopy (cryo-EM) techniques allow researchers to elucidate the
three-dimensional structure of molecules in solution. The plurality of
methods used to investigate the structure of biomolecules, along with
the occasional disagreements between results yielded by different
methods, provided an interesting case study for exploring the question
pluralism vs. monism in science (Mitchell and Gronenborn 2017;
Mitchell 2009; Bolinska 2022; Vallejos-Baccelliere and Vecchi 2024;
see also entry on pluralism [link here to entry
&ldquo;pluralism&rdquo;). These new techniques also revealed that many
proteins contain relatively large unstructured or low-complexity
domains. The fact that many such domains are evolutionarily conserved
suggests that they have biologically relevant functions, such as
providing flexible scaffolds for binding and concentrating
biomolecules in specific areas of the cell. Some scaffolding
structures can form membraneless organelles, or biomolecular
condensates, which, unlike macromolecular machines with a fixed
stoichiometry and geometry (Alberts 1998), behave more like liquids
with a dynamic and variable composition and geometry (Banani et al.
2017).</p>

<p>
Stem cell research was marked by major breakthroughs that received
extensive coverage in the media. In 1958, John Gurdon successfully
cloned a frog using a nuclear transplantation technique. The fact that
nuclei extracted from differentiated cells and transplanted into
enucleated eggs develop into apparently normal organisms led
scientists to conclude that cell differentiation is not irreversible,
as once thought, but differentiated cells can be
&ldquo;reprogrammed&rdquo; into totipotent and pluripotent stem cells.
Unlike &ldquo;genetic programming,&rdquo; &ldquo;cell
programming&rdquo; does not involve the alteration of coding
sequences, but rather the overexpression of transcription factors
responsible for the activation of the embryonic stem critical genes
(Fagan 2013, 2021). </p>

<p>
Although it has long been suspected that cellular behaviors must be
inherently probabilistic due to the stochastic nature of the molecular
mechanisms underpinning them, it was generally assumed that cells
manage to minimize molecular noise in order to reliably generate the
deterministic behaviors typically observed by studying large
populations of cells. This assumption is, however, challenged by an
increasing number of studies demonstrating that even isogenic
populations of cells grown in the same environment can display
phenotypic differences. For example, the expression levels of genes
coding for ion channels in neurons of the same type can vary
drastically between cells and between individuals, resulting in
measurable differences in the values of synaptic and membrane
conductances (Marder and Taylor 2011). This, and other similar
phenomena are relevant to the problem of extrapolation, albeit this
time it concerns inferences about individual or singular behaviors
given knowledge of population-level statistics. For example, while
studies on cell populations support the conclusion that cells respond
in a graded fashion to stimuli, it is possible that, in reality, each
cell adopts a categorical, &ldquo;on&rdquo; or &ldquo;off&rdquo;
response phenotype.</p>

<p>
Finally, while many branches of biology have &ldquo;gone
molecular,&rdquo; molecular biology itself embraced mathematical
modelling. Mathematical modelling is a common practice in many
branches of biology, including classical and clinical genetics,
ecology, epidemiology, systems biology, as well as in chemistry and
biochemistry. In contrast, molecular biology traditionally relies on
qualitative descriptions that have inspired various philosophical
characterizations of mechanisms (see Section 2.1). This changed over
the past two decades and the latest edition of the widely used
<em>Molecular Biology of the Cell</em> textbook (Alberts et al. 2022,
Ch. 8) has a substantive section dedicated to the mathematical
analysis of biological function meant to complement biochemical and
molecular methods of analysis. The dynamic properties of molecular
mechanisms are often investigated by mathematical modelling approaches
borrowed from chemistry, cybernetics, mechanical engineering and
computer science. Likewise, in vitro reconstitution experiments [for a
discussion of in vitro reconstitution experiments, see (Weber 2005;
Matlin 2022)] are supplemented by in silico experiments used to
generate evidence that, in principle, a proposed mechanism suffices to
produce a phenomenon of interest (Bechtel 2011; Braillard &amp; Malaterre
2015) [although such simulations cannot demonstrate that the proposed
mechanism is actually responsible for the phenomenon (Craver
2006)].</p>

<p>
The mathematization and subtle shifts in explanatory approaches in
molecular biology and related fields, the development of new
experimental techniques, as well as the experimental and theoretical
exchanges with other disciplines within and outside biology introduce
new problems of interest for philosophers of science and biology.
These include the questions concerning the nature of mechanisms
(Section 2.1) and the completeness of mechanistic explanations
(Section 3.2), reduction and integration (Section 3.1), extrapolations
to individual biological systems (Section 3.3) and experimentation
(Section 3.4).</p>

<h2 id="ConcMoleBiol">2. Concepts in Molecular Biology</h2>

<p>
The concepts of <em>mechanism</em>, <em>information</em>, and
<em>gene</em> all figured quite prominently in the history of
molecular biology. Philosophers, in turn, have focused a great deal of
attention on these concepts to understand how they have been, are, and
should be used.</p>

<h3 id="Mech">2.1 Mechanism</h3>

<p>
Traditionally, philosophers of science took successful scientific
explanations to result from derivation from laws of nature (Hempel and
Oppenheim 1948; see the entries on
 <a href="../laws-of-nature/">laws of nature</a>
 and
 <a href="../scientific-explanation/">scientific explanation</a>).
 Philosophers of biology have criticized this traditional analysis as
inapplicable to biology, and especially molecular biology. (For
further discussion, see Beatty 1995; Brandon 1997; Lange 2000;
Mitchell 1997; Smart 1963; Sober 1997; Waters 1998; Weber 2005).</p>

<p>
Working in the causal-mechanical tradition pioneered by Wesley Salmon
(1984, 1998), philosophers turned to understanding mechanism
elucidation as the avenue to scientific explanation in biology
(Bechtel and Abrahamsen 2005; Bechtel and Richardson 1993; Craver
2007; Darden 2006a; Glennan 2017; Machamer, Darden, and Craver 2000;
Sarkar 1998; Schaffner 1993; Woodward 2002, 2010). Several
characterizations of what a mechanism is have emerged over the years
(Bechtel and Abrahamsen 2005; Glennan 2002; Machamer, Darden, and
Craver 2000). Stuart Glannan summarizes the essential features of
mechanisms as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A mechanism for a phenomenon consists of entities (or parts) whose
activities and interactions are organized so as to be responsible for
the phenomenon. (Glennan 2017: 17) [for a similar characterization see
(Illari and Williamson 2012: 120)]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As an example, consider the phenomenon of DNA replication. The double
helix of DNA (an entity with an organization) unwinds (an activity)
and new component parts (entities) bond (an activity) to both parts of
the unwound DNA helix. DNA is a nucleic acid composed of several
subparts: a sugar-phosphate backbone and nucleic acid bases. When DNA
unwinds, the bases exhibit weak charges, properties that result from
slight asymmetries in the molecules. These weak charges allow a DNA
base and its complement to engage in the activity of forming hydrogen
(weak polar) chemical bonds; the specificity of this activity is due
to the topological arrangements of the weak polar charges in the
subparts of the base. Ultimately, entities with polar charges enable
the activity of hydrogen bond formation. After the complementary bases
align, then the backbone forms via stronger covalent bonding. The
mechanism proceeds with unwinding and bonding together (activities)
new parts, to produce two helices (newly formed entities) that are
(more or less faithful) copies of the parent helix. (This process of
&ldquo;semi-conservative replication&rdquo; and the Meselson-Stahl
experiment that confirmed it are discussed in more detail in
 <a href="#Expe">Section 3.4</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
There are several virtues of the causal-mechanical approach to
understanding scientific explanation in molecular biology. For one, it
is truest to molecular biologists&rsquo; own language when engaging in
biological explanation. Molecular biologists rarely describe their
practice and achievements as the development of new theories; rather,
they describe their practice and achievements as the elucidation of
molecular mechanisms (Baetu 2019; Craver 2001; Machamer, Darden,
Craver 2000; [link here to entry &ldquo;mechanisms in science&rdquo;).
Second, knowledge of a mechanism shows how something works: elucidated
mechanisms provide understanding. Third, the causal-mechanical
approach captures biological explanations of both regularity and
variation. Unlike in physics, where a scientist assumes that an
electron is an electron is an electron, a biologist is often
interested in precisely what makes one individual different from
another, one population different from another, or one species
different from another (Calcott 2009; Tabery 2009, 2014). Finally,
knowledge of mechanisms potentially allows one to intervene to change
what the mechanism produces, to manipulate its parts to construct
experimental tools, or to repair a broken, diseased mechanism. In
short, knowledge of elucidated mechanisms provides understanding,
prediction, and control.</p>

<h3 id="Info">2.2 Information</h3>

<p>
The language of information appears often in molecular biology. Genes
as linear DNA sequences of bases are said to carry
&ldquo;information&rdquo; to produce proteins. During protein
synthesis, the information is &ldquo;transcribed&rdquo; from DNA to
messenger RNA and then &ldquo;translated&rdquo; from RNA to protein.
With respect to inheritance, it is often said that what is passed from
one generation to the next is the &ldquo;information&rdquo; in the
genes, namely the linear ordering of bases along complementary DNA
strands. Historians of biology have tracked the entrenchment of
information-talk in molecular biology (Kay 2000) since its
introduction.</p>

<p>
The question for philosophers of biology is whether an analysis of the
concept of information can capture the various ways in which the
concept is used in molecular biology (e.g., Maynard Smith 2000). The
usage of &ldquo;information&rdquo; in the mathematical theory of
communication is too impoverished to capture the molecular biological
usage, since the coded sequences in the DNA are more than just a
signal with some number of bits that may or may not be accurately
transmitted (Sarkar 1996b,c; Sterelny and Griffiths 1999; Shannon and
Weaver 1949). Conversely, the usage in cognitive neuroscience, with
its talk of &ldquo;representations&rdquo; (e.g., Crick 1988) may be
said to be too rich, since the coded sequences in the DNA are also not
said to have within them a representation of the whole-organism
(K&ouml;lv 2020) or even of the structure of the protein (Darden
2006b). No definition of &ldquo;information&rdquo; as it is used in
molecular biology has yet received wide support among philosophers of
biology.</p>

<p>
Stephen Downes (2006) helpfully distinguishes three positions on the
relation between information and the natural world:</p>

<ol>

<li>Information is present in DNA and other nucleotide sequences.
Other cellular mechanisms contain no information.</li>

<li>Information is present in DNA, in other nucleotide sequences and
other cellular mechanisms, for example cytoplasmic or extra-cellular
proteins; and in many other media, for example, the embryonic
environment or components of an organism&rsquo;s wider
environment.</li>

<li>DNA and other nucleotide sequences do not contain information, nor
do any other cellular mechanisms.</li>
</ol>

<p>
These options may be read either ontologically or heuristically. A
heuristic reading of (1), for instance, views the talk of information
in molecular biology as useful in providing a way of talking and in
guiding research. And so the heuristic benefit of the information
concept can be defended without making any commitment to the
ontological status (Sarkar 2000). Indeed, one might argue that a vague
and open-ended use of information is valuable for heuristic purposes,
especially during early discovery phases in the development of a
field.</p>

<p>
Philosophers&rsquo; discussions of the concept of information in
biology have also focused on its ontological reading. Three different
philosophical accounts of information serve as exemplars of
Downes&rsquo; three categories. Ulrich Stegmann (2005) provides an
example of Downes&rsquo; first category with his analysis of
template-directed synthesis. (Stegmann does explicitly allow that
components other than nucleotide sequences might contain what he calls
instructional information. However, his only example is a thought
experiment involving enzymes linearly ordered along a membrane;
nothing of the sort is known to exist or even seems very likely to
exist.) Stegmann calls this the sequentialization view.
Stegmann&rsquo;s instructional account of genetic information requires
that the component carrying the information satisfy the following
conditions: an advance specification of the kind and order of steps
that yield a determinate outcome if the steps are carried out. On his
account, DNA qualifies as an instructional information carrier for
replication, transcription and translation. The sequence of bases
provides the order. The hydrogen bonding between specific bases and
the genetic code provides the specific kinds of steps. And the
mechanisms of replication, transcription, and translation yield
certain outcomes: a copy of the DNA double helix, an mRNA, and a
linear order of amino acids. Also, because DNA carries information for
a specific outcome, an error can occur as the mechanism operates to
produce that outcome; hence Stegmann&rsquo;s account allows for errors
and error-correcting mechanisms (such as proof-reading mechanisms that
correct DNA mutations). For more on this topic, see the entry on
 <a href="../information-biological/">biological information</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Eva Jablonka (2002) offers an example of Downes&rsquo; second
category. She argues that information is ubiquitous. She defines
information as follows: a source becomes an informational input when
an interpreting receiver can react to the form of the source (and
variations in this form) in a functional manner. She claims a broad
applicability of this definition. The definition, she says,
accommodates information stemming from environmental cues as well as
from evolved signals, and calls for a comparison between
information-transmission in different types of inheritance systems
&mdash; the genetic, the epigenetic, the behavioral, and the
cultural-symbolic. On this view, genes have no theoretically
privileged informational status (Jablonka 2002: 583).</p>

<p>
In line with Downes&rsquo; third category, C. Kenneth Waters argues
that information is a useful term in rhetorical contexts, such as
seeking funding for DNA sequencing by claiming that DNA carries
information. However, from an ontological perspective, Waters claims
that explication of DNA&rsquo;s causal role has no need for the
concept of information. Genes, he argues, should not be viewed as
&ldquo;immaterial units of information&rdquo; (Waters 2000: 541). As
discussed in
 <a href="#Gene">Section 2.3</a>
 below, Waters&rsquo; focus is on stretches of DNA whose causal roles
are as actual specific difference makers in genetic mechanisms (Waters
2007). Talk of information is not needed; causal role function talk is
sufficient. (For more on Waters&rsquo; view see the entry on
 <a href="../molecular-genetics/">molecular genetics</a>;
 for others who make similar points, see Morange 2020; Sustar 2007;
Weber 2005, 2006.) More generally, Oliver Lean (2020) argues that the
notion of binding specificity characteristic of many molecular
interactions (including those between enzymes and substrates,
transcription factors and DNA binding sites, antibodies and antigens,
DNA and RNA) is intimately linked to &ldquo;the issue of causal
selection &ndash; the practice of singling out one or more causes of
an outcome as being &rdquo;the&ldquo; cause, or of particular
relevance or importance&rdquo; and may provide the equivalent of an
ideal intervention.</p>

<h3 id="Gene">2.3 Gene</h3>

<p>
The question of whether classical, Mendelian genetics could be (or
already has been) reduced to molecular biology (to be taken up in
 <a href="#Redu">Section 3.1</a>
 below) motivated philosophers to consider the connectability of the
term they shared: the gene. Investigations of reduction and scientific
change raised the question of how the concept of the gene evolved,
figuring prominently in C. Kenneth Waters&rsquo; (1990, 1994, 2007,
see entry on
 <a href="../molecular-genetics/">molecular genetics</a>),
 Philip Kitcher&rsquo;s (1982, 1984) and Raphael Falk&rsquo;s (1986)
work. Over time, however, philosophical discussions of the gene
concept took on a life of their own, as philosophers raised questions
independent of the reduction debate: What is a gene? And is there
anything causally distinct about DNA? (see the entry on the
 <a href="../gene/">gene</a>)</p>
 
<p>
Falk (1986) explicitly asked philosophers and historians of biology,
&ldquo;What is a Gene?&rdquo; Discoveries such as overlapping genes,
split genes, and alternative splicing (discussed in
 <a href="#ClasPeri">Section 1.2</a>)
 made it clear that simply equating a gene with an uninterrupted
stretch of DNA would no longer capture the complicated
molecular-developmental details of mechanisms such as gene expression
(Downes 2004; Luc-Germain, Ratti and Boem 2015). In an effort to
answer Falk&rsquo;s question, two general trends have emerged in the
philosophical literature: first, distinguish multiple gene concepts to
capture the complex structural and functional features separately, or
second, rethink a unified gene concept to incorporate such complexity.
(For a survey of gene concepts defended by philosophers, see Griffiths
and Stotz 2007, 2013; Rheinberger and Muller-Wille 2018. In contrast,
for an argument as to why philosophers should stop investigating the
question, &ldquo;What is a gene?&rdquo; see Boem et al. 2016.)</p>

<p>
An example of the first line came from Evelyn Fox Keller&rsquo;s
distinction between the gene as a structural and functional entity
(Keller 2000). A structural gene concept picks out an ordered sequence
of DNA, usually one that corresponds to a single protein or a single
structural, catalytic, or regulatory RNA molecule. In contrast, a
functional gene concept picks out entities that give rise to
phenotypes, which include other parts of the genome. For example,
stretches of regulatory DNA, which do not code for proteins, dictate
when and where proteins are made. Since they play a causal role in
phenotypic expression, they are included under a functional gene
concept. (Lenny Moss (2001, 2002) offers another example of a
gene-concept divider.)</p>

<p>
A second philosophical approach for conceptualizing the gene involved
rethinking a single, unified gene concept that captured the
molecular-developmental complexities. For example, Eva Neumann-Held
(Neumann-Held 1999, 2001; Griffiths and Neumann-Held 1999) claimed
that a &ldquo;process molecular gene concept&rdquo; (PMG) embraced
complicated developmental intricacies. On her unified view, the term
&ldquo;gene&rdquo; referred to &ldquo;the recurring process that leads
to the temporally and spatially regulated expression of a particular
polypeptide product&rdquo; (Neumann-Held 1999). More recently,
Francesca Bellazzi (2022) has argued for an even more flexible and
context dependent gene concept. According to Bellazzi, genes are
weakly emergent entities that are both relational and temporal.
Specifically, genes emerge from precise segments of DNA during the
process of transcription, which occurs when intricate mechanisms
operate within the surrounding context. (Falk (2001) offers another
example of a gene-concept unifier.)</p>

<p>
Relatedly, philosophers have also debated the causal distinctiveness
of DNA. Although there is wide agreement that phenotypes are caused by
stretches of DNA and by all the other developmental resources involved
in gene expression, there is disagreement about how to weigh the
importance of the causal contribution of all the factors involved.
Proponents of the &ldquo;causal parity thesis&rdquo; argue that all
developmental resources involved in the generation of a phenotype
should be treated as being on par (Griffiths and Knight 1998;
Griffiths and Stotz 2013; Robert 2004; Stotz 2006). In contrast,
proponents of the &ldquo;causal specificity&rdquo; of genetic material
argue that the ability to exercise more precise control over its
effects sets genetic material apart from other biological causes
(Griffiths et al. 2015; Waters 2007; Weber 2017). Waters was the first
to offer an influential response to the causal parity thesis, based on
his distinction between &ldquo;potential&rdquo; and &ldquo;actual
difference makers.&rdquo; According to Waters, DNA is causally
distinctive because it fulfills the conditions of being an actual
difference maker (see the entry on
 <a href="../molecular-genetics/">molecular genetics</a>
 [link here to entry &ldquo;molecular genetics&rdquo;] for more on
this distinction).</p>

<p>
Related to the debate about the causal distinctiveness of DNA has been
the question of how to classify so-called junk DNA. Most biologists
and philosophers of biology do not consider junk-DNA to be on causal
par with coding DNA, because mutations in junk-DNA do not affect
function (although for an alternate account of junk-DNA&rsquo;s
non-coding function see Doolittle 2013). However, Joyce Havstad and
Alexander Palazzo (2022) have argued that despite its paradigmatically
non-functional role, junk DNA meets the criteria of being an actual
difference maker. But since junk-DNA is not considered to be on causal
par with coding DNA, this suggests that Waters&rsquo; account of what
makes coding DNA causally distinctive is incomplete. According to
Havstad and Palazzo, the missing components are &lsquo;causal
reach&rsquo; and &lsquo;causal efficacy.&rsquo; While junk DNA can
indeed produce causally specific proximate effects, its causal
specificity has limited reach and efficacy, which is why it is not
considered to be on par with coding DNA in terms of causality.
Nonetheless, Havstad and Palazzo maintain that the diminished causal
status of junk-DNA in relation to coding DNA does not diminish its
significance within the cell.</p>

<h2 id="MoleBiolGenePhilScie">3. Molecular Biology and General Philosophy of Science</h2>

<p>
In addition to analyzing key concepts in the field, philosophers have
employed case studies from molecular biology to address more general
issues in the philosophy of science, such as reduction, explanation,
extrapolation, and experimentation. For each of these philosophical
issues, evidence from molecular biology directs philosophical
attention toward understanding the concept of a mechanism for
addressing the topic.</p>

<h3 id="Redu">3.1 Reduction</h3>

<p>
Reduction may be understood in multiple ways depending on what it is
that is being reduced (see the entry on
 <a href="../scientific-reduction/">scientific reduction</a>).
 Theory reduction pertains to whether theories from one scientific
field can be reduced to theories from another scientific field. In
contrast, explanatory reduction (often united with methodological
reduction) pertains to whether or not explanations that come from
lower levels (often united with methodologies that investigate those
lower levels) are better than explanations that come from higher
levels. Philosophical attention to molecular biology has contributed
to debates about both of these senses of reduction (see the entry on
 <a href="../reduction-biology/">reductionism in biology</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Philosophy of biology first came to prominence as a subspecialty of
philosophy of science in the 1970s when it offered an apparent case
study by which to judge how theories from one field may reduce to
theories from another field. The specific question was: might classic,
Mendelian genetics reduce to molecular genetics (see the entry on
 <a href="../molecular-genetics/">molecular genetics</a>)?
 Kenneth Schaffner used and developed Ernst Nagel&rsquo;s (1961)
analysis of derivational theory reduction to argue for the reduction
of classical Mendelian genetics (<em>T</em><sub>2</sub>) to molecular
biology (<em>T</em><sub>1</sub>) and refined it over many years
(summarized in Schaffner 1993). The goal of formal reduction was to
logically deduce the laws of classical genetics (or its improved
successor, &ldquo;modern transmission genetics&rdquo;
<em>T</em><sub>2</sub>*) from the laws of molecular biology. Such a
derivation required that all the terms of <em>T</em><sub>2</sub>* not
in <em>T</em><sub>1</sub> had to be connected to terms in
<em>T</em><sub>1</sub> via correspondence rules. Hence, Schaffner
endeavored to find molecular equivalents of such terms as
&ldquo;gene,&rdquo; as well as predicate terms, such as &ldquo;is
dominant.&rdquo; David Hull (1974) criticized formal reduction, argued
against Schaffner&rsquo;s claims, and suggested, instead, that perhaps
molecular biology replaced classical genetics. However, the absence of
explicit laws in most fields of biology raised doubts about the
relevance of intertheoretical reduction in biology, prompting a shift
of attention to explanation and methodology. William Wimsatt (1976)
highlighted the importance of decompositional explanation via
mechanisms, while Lindley Darden and Nancy Maull (1977) focused
attention on the bridges between fields formed by part-whole
relations, structure-function relations, and cause-effect
relations.</p>

<p>
With the emergence of the new mechanistic philosophy (Glennan and
Illari 2017; Machamer et al. 2000), the question of the relationship
between molecular biology and other biological disciplines has been
analyzed through the lens of mechanisms. The decomposition of
biological systems often reveals a hierarchical organization, which
led some authors to propose that lower-level components are organized
as mechanisms underlying higher-level components (Bechtel 2006;
Bechtel and Richardson 2010; Craver 2007; Craver and Povich, 2017;
Craver et al. 2021). The notion that explanations in biology can occur
at different levels of description fueled a new reductionism debate
concerning whether lower-level molecular explanations (often united
with methodologies that investigate those lower levels) are better or
more complete than higher-level explanations. On the reductionist
side, it has been argued that higher-level explanations involving
biological or functional kinds such as organism, cell, and gene
ultimately need to be completed, and occasionally replaced, by
molecular biology explanations and, in more general terms, by
explanations in terms of chemical and physical entities and
interactions (Bickle 1998, Rosenberg 2020). In response to
reductionistic proposals, critics highlighted the fact that
biologically relevant information is coded not only in the specificity
of molecular interactions, but also in a variety of organizational and
contextual features not captured by molecular biological principles,
such as spatial, regulatory, and dynamical properties of developing
systems (Delehanty 2005; Frost-Arnold 2004; Keller 1999; Laubichler
and Wagner 2001; Love et al. 2008; Robert 2001, 2004).</p>

<p>
Eschewing the traditional reductionism-antireductionism dichotomy,
Darden (2005) argued that classical genetics and molecular biology
elucidated sequentially operating chromosomal and molecular
mechanisms, each involving different working entities operating at
different spatiotemporal scales. This suggested that an integrative
account should replace talk of reduction or replacement. Molecular
biology was born by integrating approaches from physics, chemistry and
biology (Section 1.1) and similar interdisciplinary and integrative
tendencies are illustrated by recent exchanges between molecular
biology and evolutionary biology in comparative phylogenetics,
developmental biology, and cancer research (Section 1.5). Integrative
approaches have also been proposed in an attempt to reconcile
mechanistic explanations with other types of explanation that may be
relevant to molecular biology (Section 3.2 below). For example, it has
been argued that, while essential to the understanding of life (as
well as gaining experimental control and developing new treatments and
technologies), molecular explanations are incomplete or insufficient,
and need to be complemented by mathematical models in order to account
for dynamical and quantitative aspects of biological phenomena
(Bechtel and Abrahamsen 2010; Braillard et Malaterre 2015; Brigandt
2013). This particular debate can be understood as an instance of a
more general debate about the relationship between molecular and
systems biology (Bechtel 2020; Bechtel and Abrahamsen 2010; De Backer,
De Waele, and Van Speybroeck 2010; Huettemann and Love 2011; Marco
2012; Morange 2008; Pigliucci 2013; Powell and Dupre 2009; see also
section 3.2 below and the entries on
 <a href="../feminist-philosophy-biology/">feminist philosophy of biology</a>,
 <a href="../systems-synthetic-biology/">philosophy of systems and synthetic biology</a>, and
 <a href="../multiple-realizability/">multiple realizability</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="Expl">3.2 Explanation</h3>

<p>
In addition to mechanistic approaches (Section 2.1), other accounts of
explanation in molecular biology have been proposed (Braillard and
Malaterre 2015). Philip Kitcher (1989, 1993) developed a
unificationist account of explanation, and he and Sylvia Culp
explicitly applied it to molecular biology (Culp and Kitcher 1989).
Among the premises of the &ldquo;Watson-Crick&rdquo; argument schema
were &ldquo;transcription, post-transcriptional modification and
translation for the alleles in question&rdquo;, along with details of
cell biology and embryology for the organisms in question (Kitcher
1989). An explanation of a particular pattern of distribution of
progeny phenotypes in a genetic cross resulted from instantiating the
appropriate deductive argument schema: the variables were filled with
the details from the particular case and the conclusion derived from
the premises.</p>

<p>
Several authors have raised the possibility that explanations in terms
of pathways are distinct from mechanistic explanations (Boniolo and
Campaner 2018; Brigandt 2018), most notably on the grounds that
&ldquo;a single pathway can be instantiated by different mechanisms,
that distinct pathways can have similar mechanisms, and that pathways
can be discovered without any knowledge of the mechanisms that
underlie them&rdquo; (Ross 2018: 132). While Lauren Ross argued for
drawing a sharper distinction between mechanistic and pathway
explanations, Stavros Ioannidis and Stathis Psillos (2017) proposed to
revise the concept of mechanism along the lines of a causal pathway or
structure, arguing for a minimalist mechanistic ontology committed
solely to the existence of causal dependencies between measured or
manipulated variables. The realization that unstructured proteins can
have biologically relevant functions and the discovery of biomolecular
condensates (Section 1.5), contributed to a renewed philosophical
interest in process ontologies. Proponents of processual approaches
(Bapteste and Dupre 2013; Bickhard 2011; Campbell 2015; Dupre 2012;
Jaeger and Monk 2015; Jaeger et al. 2012; Meincke 2018; Nicholson and
Dupre 2018) argue that processes are ontologically primary and that
mechanistic accounts mistakenly assume that parts composing a
biological mechanism can be identified independently of the activities
or processes in which they are involved. However, other authors
challenged the idea that processual explanations can be sufficiently
grounded &ldquo;<em>without</em> the metaphysical underpinning of the
very mechanisms which processes purport to replace&rdquo; (Austin
2016: 639).</p>

<p>
Finally, the concept of mechanistic explanation itself evolved in
response to recent trends in molecular biology. Traditionally,
mechanistic explanations in molecular biology are construed as
qualitative representations consisting of narratives or diagrams.
These representations, which may be called &ldquo;models of a
mechanism&rdquo; (see the entry on
 <a href="../models-science/">models in science</a>),
 are meant to convey an intuitive understanding by simulating the
working of mechanisms in our imagination (Bechtel and Abrahamsen 2005)
or by analogy with more common types of activities (Machamer 2004).
While qualitative representations play an important role in scientific
practice, they remain heavily idealized (Baetu 2017; Love and Nathan
2015). Quantitative and dynamic aspects are absent or highly
simplified, while known facts are distorted in order to outline a
deterministic sequence of events tracking the fate of single molecules
(a more accurate biochemical description would be that of a series of
back and forth equilibria involving populations of colliding
molecules), each assumed to be rigidly structured (ignoring the fact
that molecules vibrate and cycle through various configurations), as
they modify one another in order to bring about a change from an
initial to a final state (thus masking an underlying variety of
chemical pathways that contribute to the same final state and
alternate pathways where mechanisms fail to contribute to the output).
Mathematical modelling aims to circumvent these shortcomings by
formally describing quantitative, dynamic and stochastic aspects of
molecular mechanisms that are not adequately represented by narratives
and diagrammatic representations. The use of formal methods for
understanding molecular mechanisms attracted the attention of
philosophers, who explored the extent to which mathematical modelling
and computer simulations complement and extend mechanistic
explanations (Bechtel and Abrahamsen 2010; Brigandt 2013; Braillard
and Malaterre 2015) or constitute a significant departure from a
strictly mechanistic mode of explanation (Braillard 2010; Silberstein
and Chemero 2013).</p>

<p>
The fact that many biological mechanisms are stochastic contributed to
a general debate about the extent to which regularity is an essential
characteristic of mechanisms (Andersen 2012; Darden 2008), with some
authors emphasizing the highly irregular of some mechanisms (Bogen
2005). In the case of molecular biology, the intrinsically stochastic
nature of molecular mechanisms further led scientists and philosophers
to question the hegemony of the traditional
&ldquo;order-from-order&rdquo; paradigm of molecular biology initially
suggested by Schroedinger (1944) and reinforced by the specificity of
molecular interactions [for a discussion of the concept of
specificity, see (Lean 2020)], and introduce an alternative,
&ldquo;order-from-disorder&rdquo; explanatory approach (Ilan 2020;
Kupiec et al. 2011). For example, probabilistic biases in the
distribution of adhesion proteins suffice to generate the right amount
of twisting in the developing gut, while stochastic gene expression is
responsible for generating blue- to ultraviolet-sensitive cells ratios
in the <em>Drosophila</em> eye. Another interesting example is that of
molecular ratchet mechanisms exploiting thermal noise to do mechanical
work (Astumian 2001), which led Bechtel and Bollhagen (2021: 12705) to
argue that the traditional mechanistic ontology of mechanisms
&ldquo;should be expanded to include constraints and
energetics.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="Extr">3.3 Extrapolation</h3>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing">
As discussed earlier in the historical sections, molecular biologists
have relied heavily on model organisms (see the entry on
 <a href="../models-science/">models in science</a>).
 For example, research on <em>E. coli</em> and yeast provided the
foundation needed to understand genetic mechanisms in various cells,
but the advent of recombinant DNA technology in the 1970s enabled
researchers to modify model organisms to fit their needs. The fruit
fly was often used in the early recombinant DNA experiments. According
to Marcel Weber &ldquo;The molecular Drosophilists <em>genetically
engineered</em> their favorite lab animal until it became a highly
productive system for identifying and isolating DNA regions that
interested them&rdquo; (Weber 2005, 169). The latest CRISPR technology
has made the modification of model organisms even more precise and
affordable. Today, researchers often &ldquo;humanize&rdquo; laboratory
mice by inserting human genes or cells into the animal to model some
aspect of human physiology (Piotrowska 2013). However, humanized
animals are not human, which means that researchers must still justify
their beliefs that these mice are similar enough to their human
counterparts to mimic human physiology. Relatedly, when a therapy
tested on humanized mice shows promising results, researchers must
still justify any inference about the likelihood of the therapy being
effective in humans despite causally relevant differences between the
model and the target.</p>

<p>
This difficulty, of &ldquo;transferring causal generalizations from
one context to another when homogeneity cannot be presumed&rdquo;
(Steel 2008: 3) is known as the <em>problem of extrapolation</em>. A
number of philosophers have explored this problem in the context of
molecular biology (see, for example, Ankeny 2001; Baetu 2016; Bechtel
and Abrahamsen 2005; Bolker 1995, 2009, 2017; Burian 1993b; Darden
2007; LaFollette and Shanks 1996; Love 2009; Nelson 2018; Piotrowska
2013; Schaffner 1986; Steel 2008; Weber 2005; Wimsatt 1998). Solving
the problem of extrapolation has proven difficult because determining
whether the model and its target are similar enough in causally
relevant respects often leads to a trap&mdash;what Daniel Steel (2008)
calls the &ldquo;extrapolator&rsquo;s circle.&rdquo; One way to escape
the extrapolator&rsquo;s circle is to black box the mechanisms being
compared and instead treat the problem of extrapolation as a
statistical problem (cf. Cook and Campbell 1979). This method hinges
on demonstrating statistically significant outcomes from the same
intervention, sidestepping the need to establish mechanism similarity.
One problem with relying merely on statistics to solve the problem of
extrapolation, however, is that it cannot show that an observed
correlation between model and target is the result of intervention and
not a confounder. A more promising formal approach to the problem of
extrapolation exploits the fact that certain probability distributions
and patterns of statistical dependency are insensitive to changes in
causal structure (Hern&aacute;n and Vanderweele 2011; Pearl and
Bareinboim 2014).</p>

<p>
A different strategy for avoiding the extrapolator&rsquo;s circle is
to remove the black box and compare the two mechanisms but argue that
they do not have to be causally similar at every stage for
extrapolation to be justified. This approach avoids the circle because
the suitability of a model can be established given only partial
information about the target. For example, Steel argues that only the
stages downstream from the point where the mechanisms in the model and
target are likely to differ need to be compared, since the point where
differences are likely will serve as a bottleneck through which the
eventual outcome must be produced. Despite its promise, criticisms
have emerged. Jeremy Howick et al. (2013) express concern that
identifying bottlenecks and downstream differences requires more
target information than Steel acknowledges, potentially reintroducing
the extrapolator&rsquo;s circle. Another critique, raised by Julian
Reiss (2010), Federica Russo (2010), and Brendan Clarke et al. (2014),
is that Steel&rsquo;s approach doesn&rsquo;t address the masking
problem, leaving open the possibility of multiple paths linking X to
Y. For example, there may be an upstream difference that affects the
outcome but does not pass through the downstream stages of the
mechanism. (This problem is taken up again below in
 <a href="bookmark://Expb">Section 3.4</a>.)
 A third concern, voiced by Baetu (2016), is that mechanistic accounts
often combine data from various experimental setups, creating a
theoretical chimera unsupported by a consistent mechanism present in
any cell or organism. Instead, as several authors have also pointed
out (Huber and Keuck 2013; Lemoine 2017; Nelson 2013, 2018), the
mechanism of interest is often stipulated first and then verified
piecemeal in many different experimental organisms. The result is what
Mael Lemoine (2017) has called a &ldquo;theoretical chimera&rdquo;, a
hypothesis supported by heterogeneous partial models. On the chimera
view of extrapolation, it&rsquo;s possible that all one-to-one
analogies work, and yet the aggregate theoretical chimera model
fails.</p>

<h3 id="Expe">3.4 Experimentation</h3>

<p>
The history of molecular biology is in part the history of
experimental techniques designed to probe the macromolecular
mechanisms found in living things. Philosophers in turn have looked to
molecular biology as a case study for understanding how
experimentation works in science&mdash;how it contributes to
scientific discovery, distinguishes correlation from causal and
constitutive relevance, and decides between competing hypotheses
(Marcum 2007; Baetu 2019; Barwich and Baschir 2017; Craver and Darden
2013; Rheinberger 1997; Weber 2009, 2008, 2005; see also Experiment in
Biology [link here to entry &ldquo;Experiment in Biology&rdquo;]).</p>

<p>
Lindley Darden has focused on the strategies that scientists employ to
construct, evaluate, and revise mechanical explanations of phenomena;
on her view, discovery is a piecemeal, incremental, and iterative
process of mechanism elucidation. In the 1950s and 1960s, for example,
scientists from both molecular biology and biochemistry employed their
own experimental strategies to elucidate the mechanisms of protein
synthesis that linked DNA to the production of proteins. Molecular
biologists moved forward from DNA using experimental techniques such
as x-ray crystallography and model building to understand how the
structure of DNA dictated what molecules it could interact with;
biochemists simultaneously moved backward from the protein products
using <em>in vitro</em> experimental systems to understand the
chemical reactions and chemical bonding necessary to build a protein.
They met in the middle at RNA, ultimately leading to Watson&rsquo;s
famous mechanism schema DNA &rarr; RNA &rarr; protein. Far from being
philosophically inscrutable, Darden points out that the molecular
biologists were &ldquo;forward chaining&rdquo; while the biochemists
were &ldquo;backward chaining&rdquo;, using information about the
working entities and activities that they knew about to infer what
could come next or before in the mechanism of protein synthesis
(Darden 2006a: chapters 3, 12; Craver and Darden 2013: chapter
10).</p>

<p>
Tudor Baetu (2019) has attempted a reconstruction of the discovery
process in molecular biology using the mechanisms of inflammatory
responses as a case study. Following Bechtel and Richardson (1993), he
argues research in molecular biology typically involves the
development of standardized experimental models in the context of
which phenomena can be systematically replicated. For example, an
experimental model of inflammation specifies a replicable and
recognizable physical object of investigation, namely the experimental
setup likely to contain within its spatiotemporal boundaries all the
causal ingredients required for producing an inflammatory response of
the skin. Putative mechanistic components are identified by
systematically targeting variables describing the experimental setup
in the hope of demonstrating that specific changes in the experimental
setup and the physical systems of which it is composed result in
changes in the phenomenon under investigation (Craver and Darden
2013). However, in contrast to &ldquo;levelled&rdquo; mutual
manipulability accounts proposed in the mechanistic literature
(Craver, Glennan, and Povich 2021; Craver 2007; entry on
 <a href="../science-mechanisms/">mechanisms in science</a>),
 Baetu argues that experiments in molecular biology can only generate
evidence for causal mediation, which only allows for the
reconstruction of &ldquo;flat&rdquo; mechanisms in which levels of
decomposition are replaced by levels of graininess of causal
descriptions [For similar views see (Fazekas 2022; Harinen 2014).]
Finally, a mechanism must be &ldquo;recomposed&rdquo; to show how it
generates the phenomenon (Bechtel 2011). In practice, a
mechanism&rsquo;s recomposition often relies on in vitro
reconstitution experiments (Weber 2005; Matlin 2022) or mathematical
models (Braillard and Malaterre 2015) aiming to demonstrate that
components organized, acting, and having the properties described in
the mechanistic explanation can, and ideally are sufficient to produce
the phenomenon under investigation. A physical interpretation of the
variables measured and manipulated in experiments, based on a
theoretical commitment of molecular biology to the ontology of
chemistry or an understanding of how experimental techniques work
(Weber 2009), is also an important ingredient in the recomposition of
mechanisms.</p>

<p>
Experiments from molecular biology have also figured into
philosophical discussions about the possibility of &ldquo;crucial
experiments&rdquo;. An experiment is taken to be a crucial experiment
if it is devised so as to result in the confirmation of one hypothesis
by way of refuting other competing hypotheses. But the very idea of a
crucial experiment, Pierre Duhem pointed out, assumes that the set of
known competing hypotheses contains all possible explanations of a
given phenomenon such that the refutation of all but one of the
hypotheses deductively ensures the confirmation of the hypothesis left
standing. However, if there are in fact unknown alternatives that
weren&rsquo;t considered in the set of competing hypotheses, Duhem
warned, then the refutation cannot guarantee the confirmation of the
last hypothesis standing (also see the entry on Pierre Duhem [link
here to entry &ldquo;Pierre Duhem&rdquo;). (Duhem raised two problems
for crucial experiments&mdash;the problem mentioned above, as well as
the problem of auxiliary assumptions, which any hypothesis brings with
it; for reasons of space, we will only discuss the former here.)
Marcel Weber has analyzed two famous discovery episodes in molecular
biology, Peter Mitchell&rsquo;s elucidation of the mechanism for
oxidative phosphorylation (Weber 2009) and the Meselson-Stahl
experiment corroborating the semiconservative DNA replication
mechanism proposed by Watson and Crick (Weber 2005: Chapter 4) to
offer a different vision of how crucial experiments work. He concludes
that, in both cases, experiments generated strong evidence favoring
one mechanistic hypothesis while ruling out the most important rival
explanations proposed at the time, thus approximating the ideal of a
crucial experiment. However, Weber argues that we should understand
the quick uptake of Meselson and Stahl&rsquo;s experimental result
(Meselson and Stahl 1958; Holmes 2001) as an instance of inference to
the best explanation (as opposed to Duhem&rsquo;s deductive
characterization). Meselson and Stahl, Weber claims, took the
physiological mechanism of DNA replication and then embedded it in an
&ldquo;experimental mechanism&rdquo;; that experimental mechanism then
generated the observed data pattern of heavy-vs-light DNA. Moreover,
any hypothesis of DNA replication had to satisfy mechanistic
constraints imposed by what was already known about the physiological
mechanism&mdash;that DNA was a double helix, and that the sequence of
nucleotides in the DNA needed to be preserved in subsequent
generations. So Duhem&rsquo;s concern about unknown alternatives was
alleviated because known mechanistic constraints limited the set of
possible hypotheses that could generate the phenomenon. On
Weber&rsquo;s reading, the mechanistic constraints culled the set of
possible hypotheses for DNA replication to semi-conservative
replication, conservative replication, and dispersive replication;
then, among that set, Meselson and Stahl devised an experimental
mechanism such that semi-conservative replication was the best
explanation of the data pattern they found.</p>

<h2 id="Conc">4. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
An overview of the history of molecular biology revealed the original
convergence of geneticists, physicists, and structural chemists on a
common problem: the nature of inheritance. Conceptual and
methodological frameworks from each of these disciplinary strands
united in the ultimate determination of the double helical structure
of DNA (conceived of as an informational molecule) along with the
mechanisms of gene replication, mutation, and expression. With this
recent history in mind, philosophers of molecular biology have
examined the key concepts of the field: mechanism, information, and
gene. Moreover, molecular biology has provided cases for addressing
more general issues in the philosophy of science, such as reduction,
explanation, extrapolation, and experimentation.</p>

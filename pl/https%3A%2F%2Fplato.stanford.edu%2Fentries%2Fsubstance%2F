<h1>Substance</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Sun Oct 3, 2004; substantive revision Mon May 6, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Many of the concepts analysed by philosophers have their origin in
ordinary &ndash; or at least extra-philosophical &ndash; language.
Perception, knowledge, causation, and mind are examples. But the
concept of substance is a philosophical term of art. Its uses in
ordinary language tend to derive, often in a rather distorted way,
from the philosophical senses. There is an ordinary concept in play
when philosophers discuss &ldquo;substance&rdquo;, and this, as we
shall see, is the concept of <em>object</em>, or <em>thing</em> when
this is contrasted with properties or events. But such
&ldquo;individual substances&rdquo; are never termed
&ldquo;substances&rdquo; outside philosophy.</p>

<p>
There exist two rather different ways of characterising the
philosophical concept of <em>substance</em>. The first is the more
generic. The philosophical term &ldquo;substance&rdquo; comes from an
early Latin translation of the Greek <em>ousia</em>. <em>Ousia</em> is
a noun derived from the verb &ldquo;<em>einai&rdquo;</em> (to be) and
is naturally translated &ldquo;being&rdquo;. According to the generic
sense, substances are those things that best merit the title
&ldquo;<em>beings&rdquo;</em>. This is usually interpreted to mean
those things that are the foundational or fundamental entities of a
given philosophical system. Thus, for an atomist, atoms are the
substances, for they are the basic things from which everything is
constructed. In David Hume&rsquo;s system, impressions and ideas are
the substances, for the same reason. In a slightly different way,
Forms are Plato&rsquo;s substances, for everything derives its
existence from Forms.</p>

<p>
The second use of the concept is more specific. According to this
usage, substances are a particular kind of entity, and some
philosophical theories acknowledge them and others do not. This
conception of substance derives from the intuitive notion of
individual <em>thing</em> or <em>object</em>, which contrasts mainly
with properties and events. According to this usage, it is a live
issue whether the fundamental entities are substances or something
else, such as events, or properties located at space-times. The issue
is how we are to understand the notion of an object, and whether, in
the light of the correct understanding, it remains a basic notion, or
one that must be characterised in more fundamental terms. Whether, for
example, an object can be thought of as nothing more than a bundle of
properties, or a series of events. </p>

<p>
The reason &ldquo;substance&rdquo; has acquired these two usages is
that the work that introduced the term to philosophy,
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Categories</em>, claims that the things that
most merit the title &ldquo;<em>beings&rdquo;</em> (substances in the
generic sense) <em>are</em> individual objects as opposed to
properties or events (substances in the specific sense). </p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="UndeIdea">1. Underlying Ideas</h2>

<p>
The idea of substance has its first theoretical articulation in
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Categories</em>, where he distinguishes between
individual substances, such as a man or a horse, and the various kinds
of properties they can possess, such as being five foot, white, lying
down, or in the Lyceum (1b25&ndash;2a4). The <em>Categories</em> would
go on to be one of the most &ndash; perhaps the most &ndash; widely
studied philosophical texts of antiquity, the middle ages, and early
modernity. It has had a profound impact on discussions of substance
ever since. </p>

<p>
There is an important distinction pointed out by Aristotle between
individual objects and kinds of individual objects. In the Categories,
this distinction is marked by the terms &ldquo;primary
substance&rdquo; and &ldquo;secondary substance.&rdquo; Thus Fido the
dog is a primary substance &ndash; an individual &ndash; but dog or
doghood is the secondary substance or substantial kind. Each arm of
this distinction raises different issues, as we will see in
 <a href="#SubsSort">section 2</a>
 and
 <a href="#SubsSort">section 3</a>.
 </p>

<p>
In addition to distinguishing substances from properties, Aristotle
also distinguishes substances from events. As a result, the term
&ldquo;substance&rdquo; is frequently taken to signify durability or
even permanence.</p>

<p>
In summary, we have inherited from Aristotle two main senses of
&ldquo;substance&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
i. those things that best merit the title &ldquo;beings&rdquo;
<br />
ii. individual objects, in contrast with properties or events</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In spelling out what exactly it is that makes something a substance in
sense ii, philosophers tend to have focussed either on the contrast
with properties or with events, leading to:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
ii.a things that possess properties but do not belong to other things
as properties
<br />
ii.b things that are relatively permanent and persist through change
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The following sections outline some landmark events in the history of
the concept of substance and some of the main topics in contemporary
discussions. </p>

<h2 id="HistPhilDebaSubs">2. History of the Philosophical Debate on Substance</h2>

<p>
Almost all major philosophers have discussed the concept of substance
and an attempt to cover all of this history would be unwieldy. This
entry concentrates on those discussions that have the greatest
continuing influence, while attempting to give a joined-up story.
Although the focus is on the concept of substance in Western
philosophy, which can be traced to Aristotle, some attention is also
given to relevant ideas in non-Western philosophy. For more on these,
see the entry on
 <a href="../early-modern-india/">Analytic Philosophy in Early Modern India</a>
 and Weir (2023b [Other Internet Resources]).</p>

<h3 id="SubsBefoAris">2.1 Substance before Aristotle</h3>

<p>
The idea that there is some fundamental kind of entity underlying the
cosmos, a substance in the generic sense, existed before Aristotle.
Perhaps the earliest influential example of this idea occurs in the
first texts of classical Indian philosophy, the <em>Upanishads</em>,
where brahman is identified as that entity that underlies all beings.
A similar idea appears in the first Western philosopher, Thales&rsquo;
claim that all is water, and his successor in the Milesian school,
Anaximander&rsquo;s claim that the fundamental entity is the
&ldquo;<em>apeiron</em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;infinite&rdquo;,
&ldquo;limitless&rdquo;). There is some evidence that both ideas were
influenced by their Indian precursors (McEvilley 2002).</p>

<p>
Another candidate for substance in the generic sense is identified by
atomists such as Democritus and several early Indian schools including
Nyaya-Vaisheshika and Jainism. These thinkers hold that the cosmos is
ultimately composed of individual, indestructible objects, entities
that therefore satisfy both the generic and the specific concepts of
substance &ndash; the former, in being the fundamental entities, and
the latter both in being objects that are do not belong to things as
properties and in their relative permanence. </p>

<p>
In his identification of fire, &ldquo;the least substantial and the
most evanescent of elemental stuffs&rdquo; as the principle underlying
the cosmos, Heraclitus can be viewed as advancing a theory on which
&ldquo;the process of change is more real than the material substances
that undergo change&rdquo; (see the entry on
 <a href="../heraclitus/">Heraclitus</a>).
 On this reading, Heraclitus is an early critic of the idea of
substance as something permanent or unchanging, a criticism that
recurs in early Buddhist philosophy, Hume, and Alfred North Whitehead
(see section 2.6, Weir 2021b: &sect; 2.c, Zycinski 1989). </p>

<p>
At the other end of the spectrum, Parmenides and his followers Xeno
and Melitus appear to argue that reality really consists in one
permanent, unchanging individual entity. This idea is a precursor to
the thesis that reality consists of just one substance that appears,
albeit in a more moderate form, in Descartes and Spinoza (see section
2.4).</p>

<p>
Plato rejects materialist attempts to explain everything on the basis
of that of which it was made. According to Plato, the entities that
best merit the title &ldquo;beings&rdquo; are the intelligible Forms,
which material objects imperfectly copy. These Forms are not
substances in the sense of being either ordinary objects as opposed to
properties or the subjects of change. Rather they are the driving
principles that give structure and purpose to everything else. At
Sophist (255c), Plato also draws a distinction between things that
exist &ldquo;in themselves&rdquo; and things that exist &ldquo;in
relation to something else&rdquo;. Though its precise nature is
subject to interpretation, this distinction can be seen as a precursor
to Aristotle&rsquo;s distinction between substances and non-substances
described in the next section, and later followers of Aristotle often
adopt Plato&rsquo;s terminology. </p>

<h3 id="ArisAccoSubs">2.2. Aristotle&rsquo;s account of substance</h3>

<p>
There are two main parts to Aristotle&rsquo;s approach to substance,
the basic account of substance in the <em>Categories</em>, and the
analysis of material substances into matter and form in the
<em>Physics</em> and <em>Metaphysics</em> Z. These will be discussed
in turn.</p>

<h4 id="Cate">2.2.1 Categories</h4>

<p>
Aristotle&rsquo;s account in <em>Categories</em> can, with some
oversimplification, be expressed as follows. The <em>primary
substances</em> are individual objects, and they can be contrasted
with everything else &ndash; secondary substances and all other
predicables &ndash; because they are not predicable of or attributable
to anything else. Thus, Fido is a primary substance, and <em>dog</em>
&ndash; the secondary substance &ndash; can be predicated of him.
<em>Fat</em>, <em>brown</em>, and <em>taller than Rover</em> are also
predicable of him, but in a rather different way from that in which
dog is. Aristotle distinguishes between two kinds of predicables,
namely those that are &ldquo;said of&rdquo; objects and those that are
&ldquo;in&rdquo; objects. The interpretation of these expressions is,
as usually with Aristotelian cruxes, very controversial, but a useful
way of looking at it is as follows. <em>Dog</em> is <em>said of</em>
Fido because it characterises him as a whole. Fat and the others are
described as <em>being in</em> because they pick out a constituent
feature that could be said to be, in a logical though not a physical
sense, part of, or <em>in</em> him. Fido the individual is not
attributable to any further thing at all.</p>

<p>
Aristotle (1a24&ndash;5) adds that when he speaks of the predicables
&ldquo;in&rdquo; a substance he means &ldquo;what is in something not
as a part, and cannot exist separately from what it is in&rdquo;.
Hence Fido might be in a certain location, <em>in</em> a kennel, or
<em>in</em> a litter while remaining a substance, so long as he is
capable of existing separately from these things. </p>

<p>
Aristotle does not further characterise the &ldquo;said of&rdquo; or
&ldquo;in&rdquo; relations upon which the account of substance in the
<em>Categories</em> depends. And so, it is perhaps best to see
Aristotle in <em>Categories </em>not as defining
&ldquo;substance&rdquo;, so that someone wholly lacking the concept
might come to understand it, but as exhibiting the marks and
characteristics of a primitive concept on which we have an intuitive
grasp. If we understand his project in this way, we can see Aristotle
as presenting various marks of substance in the <em>Categories</em>.
The marks of primary substance are:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
1. Being objects of predication but not being themselves predicable of
anything else (at least, not in the way entities in the other
categories are).</p>

<p>
2. Being able to receive contraries (4a10). A substance can go from
being hot to being cold, or from being red to being blue, but the
instance of blue in an object cannot similarly take on and lose a wide
range of attributes.</p>

<p>
3. If substance did not exist it would be impossible for things in any
of the other categories to exist. There could be no instances of
properties if there were no substances to possess them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But these criteria do not show why &ldquo;dog&rdquo; is a secondary
substance term and &ldquo;brown thing&rdquo; is not. So we need marks
for being a secondary substance, or substance concept. On this he says
two things.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
4. &ldquo;It is reasonable that, after the primary substances, their
species and genera should be the only other things called (secondary)
substance. For only they, of things predicated, reveal the primary
substance&rdquo;. (2b28&ndash;30)</p>

<p>
5. &ldquo;Of the secondary substances the species is more a substance
than the genus, since it is nearer to the primary substance. For if
one is to say of the primary substance what it is, it will be more apt
to give the species than the genus&rdquo;. (2b8&ndash;11)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The second of these two points is less controversial than the first,
for it is indubitable that species terms focus more precisely on
particular things than generic terms. The first is, however, once
again intuitive but not compelling. It appeals to the fundamental
intuition that &ldquo;dog&rdquo; tells you what Fido is better than
&ldquo;brown thing&rdquo; does, but does not really give a reason for
this claim. Only in
 <a href="#SubsSort">section 3.3</a>,
 when we discuss Wiggins&rsquo;s theory, will we find more formal
reasons for treating species or sortal concepts as more revealing of
&ldquo;what something really is&rdquo; than are other terms.</p>

<p>
A related issue is what constitutes the unity of the species or
secondary substance: why is it not just a collection of properties
and, if it is just such a collection, why is it so different from any
other collection of properties? In order to begin to see how Aristotle
tackled this problem we need the apparatus of form and matter, which
does not appear in the <em>Categories</em>. (We will see when
discussing contemporary theories in
 <a href="#SubsSort">section 3.1</a>,
 however, that it is not clear that even now can we provide a wholly
non-circular account of substance.)</p>

<h4 id="Meta">2.2.2 Physics and Metaphysics</h4>

<p>
The <em>Categories </em>sets out important logical distinctions
between different kinds of attribute, but it does not enter into a
metaphysical analysis of substance itself. This takes place mainly in
the <em>Physics</em> and in <em>Metaphysics</em>, Book Z. In these
works, Aristotle analyses substances in terms of matter and form,
whereas these notions have no place in <em>Categories</em>. The
distinction has led some commentators to talk of Aristotle&rsquo;s
&ldquo;two systems&rdquo;, containing two radically different
conceptions of substance (Graham 1987). In the earlier,
<em>Categories</em>, substances are simply individuals; in the later
work they are complexes of matter and form. Whether this represents a
change of view, or whether the purposes of the Categories simply did
not require reference to the metaphysical analysis of substance is not
clear, however. </p>

<p>
Aristotle analyses substance in terms of matter and form. Aristotle
uses the term &ldquo;matter&rdquo; not as the name for a particular
kind of stuff, nor for some ultimate constituents of bodies, such as
atoms (Aristotle rejects atomism). &ldquo;Matter&rdquo; is rather
Aristotle&rsquo;s name for whatever, for a given kind of object, meets
a certain role or function, namely being that from which the object is
constituted. Relative to the human body, matter is flesh and blood.
The matter of an axehead is the iron from which it is made. Relative
to the elements, earth, fire, air, and water, matter is an
intrinsically characterless &ldquo;prime matter&rdquo; that underlies
the qualities of them all.</p>

<p>
Aristotle uses the term &ldquo;form&rdquo; both for accidental
predicables such as having a certain shape or colour, and for the
essential predicables that make a substance what it is, such as
<em>human</em> or <em>dog</em>. These essential predicables are
referred to as &ldquo;substantial forms&rdquo; and resemble the
&ldquo;secondary substances&rdquo; of the <em>Categories</em>. In the
<em>Physics</em> (190a34&ndash;191a21) Aristotle introduces the
analysis of substances into matter and form to explain how change
occurs. Every change, Aristotle argues, involves an underlying
subject, the matter that persists through it, and a form that is
either gained or lost. Where the relevant form is a substantial form a
new substance comes into existence. The new substance does not come
into existence out of nothing, however, but out of a preexisting
matter lacking the relevant substantial form. Aristotle is motivated
by the need to show that persistence through change is possible,
despite the arguments of Parmenides and Heraclitus mentioned in
section 1 (cf. Simpson 2023: 2&ndash;3). </p>

<p>
In the <em>Physics</em>, as in the <em>Categories</em>,
&ldquo;substance&rdquo; refers to individual objects. In the
<em>Metaphysics</em>, Aristotle returns to the question of
<em>which</em> of the three items, matter, form, or the composite of
matter and form, best merits the title &ldquo;substance&rdquo;.
Aristotle acknowledges that matter can be a subject of predication and
of change, thereby meeting one of the main criteria for substance in
the <em>Categories</em> (1028b35ff). This suggests an inadequacy or
incompleteness in the account in <em>Categories</em>, for there he had
seemed to assume that a subject is an individual of an appropriate
kind &ndash; what he calls a &ldquo;this such&rdquo; &ndash; and
matter is not an individual, but that from which an individual is
made. In the <em>Metaphysics</em>, Aristotle acknowledges that matter
is a subject, but rejects the claim that it best merits the title
&ldquo;substance&rdquo; on the basis that it is not an individual.</p>

<p>
The elimination of matter as a good candidate for being substance,
leaves either form alone or the composite of form and matter. The
composite seems more consonant with the doctrine of
<em>Categories</em>, for the composite is the individual. Aristotle,
however, chooses the form as more paradigmatically substance. This has
puzzled some commentators (e.g. Wiggins 1998: 232ff). The choice of
form as substance causes perplexity because the form seems to be a
universal and equivalent to the secondary substance, and in his
attacks on Plato, Aristotle makes it plain that universals are not
substances. But whether substantial forms are universals in Aristotle
is a controversial matter. Interpreters disagree about whether the
doghood in Fido is best regarded as the universal, or as the
particular <em>instance</em> of the universal doghood, other dogs
exemplifying numerically different instances of the same universal
(for example, Lloyd 1981, Irwin 1988, Woods 1991, and Bostock&rsquo;s
commentary to Aristotle 1994). On the latter view, the most
perspicuous way of regarding the individual substance is not as the
composite of form and matter (though this is not wrong) but as the
form individualised in the matter. </p>

<p>
There are at least three serious questions about Aristotle&rsquo;s
substantial forms. One we have already noticed, namely (i) whether
such forms are universals or particulars. The others are (ii) what is
the relationship between the substantial form and the properties that
enter into its definition? We have already noticed this question when
discussing <em>Categories</em>. (iii) What is the ontological status
of such forms? This is connected with the second question, for it is
connected with the question of what the substantial form is over and
above the properties essential to it. Let us agree, for purposes of
argument, that <em>human being</em> is a kind of substance and that
<em>rationality</em> and <em>animality</em> are the properties in
terms of which that substance is defined. But what is the relation
between the substantial form and those properties? Is the presence of
the substantial form <em>human being</em> nothing more than the
presence of those properties, or is the form something further that
is, in some sense <em>responsible for</em> the presence of those
properties? </p>

<p>
Aristotle is undoubtedly a realist about substantial forms, in the
sense of thinking them to be something more than a mere collection of
properties, but how are we to understand this &ldquo;more&rdquo;? It
would be universally agreed by scholars that substantial forms are
meant to be real in the sense that they play an irreducible and
ineliminable explanatory role in the behaviour of the things in which
they are the form. There are two interpretations of what Aristotle
meant by this, one of which seems compatible with modern science and
the other not. </p>

<p>
On the compatibilist interpretation, Aristotle is merely making the
point made by contemporary non-reductionists about scientific
explanation: even if the behaviour of complex entities follows from
the laws that govern their parts or their matter, certain higher-level
(e.g. chemical, biological, psychological) explanations of their
behaviour may be impossible to capture using the terminology of
lower-level entities and laws (e.g. physics). On this interpretation,
Aristotle is attributing to substantial forms an explanatory role that
is compatible with a closed system at the level of basic physics
(Nussbaum 1978, 1984). </p>

<p>
The stronger, incompatibilist interpretation is that Aristotle did not
believe that the behaviour of complex entities followed from the laws
that govern their parts or their matter (Gotthelf 1987, Robinson
1983). Rather, the behaviour of the matter is influenced by what it is
the matter of. The nature of the matter places restrictions on what
the enmattered thing can do &ndash; an animal can only be made from
living tissue, not of stone or fire &ndash; but exactly how that
matter behaves depends on the substantial form present in it.
Whichever of these is the correct interpretation of Aristotle, it was
the second that was the core of &ldquo;Aristotelian science&rdquo; as
found in scholastic philosophy, and it was this aspect of the
Aristotelian doctrine of substance that aroused most opposition
amongst seventeenth century philosophers and scientists. </p>

<h3 id="MediAccoSubs">2.3 Medieval accounts of substance</h3>

<p>
Aristotle is not the last ancient philosopher to discuss substance. On
the contrary, most important philosophers of the ancient period made
use of Aristotle&rsquo;s concept, and the <em>Categories</em> became
the first philosophical text standardly taught to students as part of
a curriculum that dominated the Roman and post-Roman world for more
than a millennium (Weir 2021: 276&ndash;7). Nonetheless,
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>is</em> the last work on the topic of substance
in the Western tradition until the Middle Ages that retains a
significant influence in contemporary philosophy. </p>

<p>
In the intervening period important discussions of the parallel notion
of <em>Dravya</em> continue to be authored in the Indian tradition. As
mentioned above, these include Buddhist criticisms of the concept
which may have influenced Hume&rsquo;s famous criticisms of the idea
of substance in the Early Modern period (see the entry on
 <a href="../abhidharma/">Abhidharma</a>).
 Meanwhile Aristotle&rsquo;s account of substance in the
<em>Categories</em> was transmitted to scholars in the Latin West in a
translation by Boethius and underwent a revival in the Arabic-Islamic
world beginning with Al Farabi (Druart 1987).</p>

<p>
In his <em>Book of Letters</em>, Al Farabi recapitulates
Aristotle&rsquo;s account of primary and secondary substance from
<em>Categories</em>, both of which he classes as &ldquo;absolute
substance&rdquo;. To these Al Farabi adds a third variety, consisting
of that which makes known the quiddity or essence of a non-substance.
This, he classes as substance &ldquo;for something else&rdquo;.
Substance &ldquo;for something else&rdquo; stands to non-substances as
secondary substance stands to primary substance. </p>

<p>
Al Farabi also evaluates alternative candidates for the title of
&ldquo;substance&rdquo;, concluding that primary substances best merit
the title because they are &ldquo;more perfect&rdquo; than other
candidates. In his paraphrase of the <em>Categories</em>, Al Farabi
explains this idea of being &ldquo;more perfect&rdquo; as a matter of
being &ldquo;more fitted to be ontologically self-sufficient and more
fitted to be ontologically more independent from anything else&rdquo;.
(Druart 1987: 94) Al Farabi makes one exception, suggesting that a
being that is not predicated of anything else and is not a subject of
predication either will be more perfect still, and to that extent even
more worthy of the title &ldquo;substance&rdquo;. Al Farabi
nonetheless adds that it would be wrong to call such a being
&ldquo;substance&rdquo; on the basis that it is &ldquo;beyond the
categories&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
A second important contribution from the Arabic-Islamic world was made
by the Jewish Neoplatonist, Solomon ibn Gabirol (see the entry on
 <a href="../ibn-gabirol/">Solomon Ibn Gabirol [Avicebron]</a>).
 Ibn Gabirol&rsquo;s most important innovation, respecting our topic,
is his claim that all substances, apart from God, are composed of form
and matter. This contrasts with the ordinary Aristotelian
hylomorphism, that leaves room for or affirms the existence soul or
intellect as immaterial substances. Ibn Gabirol&rsquo;s position is
therefore, in a sense, an example of materialism. An important caveat,
however, is that Ibn Gabirol distinguishes the &ldquo;corporeal&rdquo;
matter of lower substances and the &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; matter of
higher substances. This spiritual matter counts as
&ldquo;matter&rdquo; because of the role it plays in a substance
&ndash; that of being the subject of form. It is not clear that
spiritual matter counts as &ldquo;matter&rdquo; in a sense that would
entail any kinship between Ibn Solomon&rsquo;s position and ordinary
materialism of the sort advocated by Democritus, Epicurus or Hobbes.
</p>

<p>
Ibn Gabirol&rsquo;s claim that all created substances are composed of
matter and form &ndash; &ldquo;universal hylomorphism&rdquo; as it is
known &ndash; had a significant impact on Scholastic philosophy of the
Latin West, convincing Bonaventure and other Franciscan philosophers.
The most influential philosopher of this period was Thomas Acquinas.
His principal contribution to the topic of substance consisted in the
development of a sophisticated response to universal hylomorphism.</p>

<p>
On the one hand, Acquinas recognised a case for extending
Aristotle&rsquo;s distinction between matter and form to all created
substances. For Acquinas holds that all created substances are
characterised by potentiality, and that in material substance
potentiality is contributed by matter. Nonetheless Acquinas objected
to the idea of attributing matter to spiritual substances, souls and
angels, on the basis that the potentiality of matter consists in its
ability to move through space, a property belonging only to corporeal
beings (Questiones Disputate de Anima: 24.1.49.142&ndash;164). </p>

<p>
Instead, Acquinas accounts for the potentiality of spiritual
substances in terms of the distinction between essence and existence,
a distinction he defends in De Ente et Essentia. In spiritual
substance it is not matter, but essence, that contributes
potentiality. While essence thus plays the same role in spiritual
substance as matter plays in corporeal substance, it does not merit
the title &ldquo;matter&rdquo; because the potentiality it contributes
does not consist in the ability to move through space. </p>

<p>
Another important feature of Ibn Gabirol&rsquo;s philosophy was his
view that one substance instantiates a &ldquo;plurality of
forms&rdquo; rather than a single substantial form. The same view was
defended by Duns Scotus. Scotus argued that a dead person&rsquo;s body
was the same body as had existed when that person was alive. The soul
had departed, so the form that was the immortal soul could not be
identical with the form of the body. This argument may seem to be
specialised to the case of the human immortal soul, but, presumably, a
similar problem applies to a dead parrot: it has lost its perceptive
and vegetative souls, yet is the same body &ndash; even if it is no
longer a parrot. By contrast, according to Aquinas, a substance
possessed only one form, and its matter was the essentially
characterless prime matter. In other words the informed parts of an
object &ndash; in the case of a living creature, its organs, and the
various kinds of stuff that constituted it (in the end, quantities of
earth, fire, air, and water) did not possess their own forms, but were
informed by the overall substantial form (see Lagerlund 2012).</p>

<p>
This line of thought proved to be a slippery slope, and, as so often,
the downward slide was led by William of Ockham. On the one hand,
Ockham was committed to hylomorphism, in that a substance is composed
of form and matter. But he reverses the priorities of Aquinas and
Scotus by saying that the parts are actual in their own right and do
not derive their actuality from the whole: rather, the whole is
nothing but the sum of its parts. This line of thought opened the way
to atomism and to treating the unity of wholes as a matter of
convention or degree. Buridan, who represents a further development in
this direction, says</p>

<blockquote>
In this sense, I am not the same as I was yesterday, because something
was part of my integrity yesterday, which has already been used up,
and something was not part of my integrity, which has meanwhile been
added by nourishment. (Buridan, <em>Physics</em> I,q.10, f. xiii;
cited Lagerlund 2012: 476)
</blockquote>

<p>
It is clear that this way of thinking paves the way for atomism and
its associated problems as they emerged in early modern
philosophy.</p>

<h3 id="DescSpinLeib">2.4 Descartes on substance</h3>

<p>
The concept of substance figures centrally in Early Modern philosophy,
playing a positive role for Descartes, Leibniz, and Spinoza, but
attracting criticism from the empiricists, Locke and Hume.
Descartes&rsquo; and Locke&rsquo;s discussions are especially
influential on later work. </p>

<p>
In replying to the second set of objections to his
<em>Meditations</em>, Descartes provides the following definition:
</p>

<blockquote>
<em>Substance</em>. This term applies to every thing in which whatever
we perceive immediately resides, as in a subject, or to every thing by
means of which whatever we perceive exists. By &ldquo;whatever we
perceive&rdquo; is meant any property, quality or attribute of which
we have a real idea. (AT 7: 161)
</blockquote>

<p>
Setting aside the epistemic designation of properties, qualities and
attributes as &ldquo;whatever we perceive&rdquo;, this resembles
Aristotles&rsquo; definition in the <em>Categories</em>, with which
Descartes would have been familiar from his schooling at <em>La
Fl&egrave;che</em>. </p>

<p>
Elsewhere, however, Descartes says that a substance is something
&ldquo;capable of existing independently&rdquo;; &ldquo;that can exist
by itself&rdquo;; or &ldquo;which exists in such a way as to depend on
no other thing for its existence&rdquo; (AT 7: 44, 226, VIII A 24).
Descartes contrasts substances, so defined, with modes, qualities and
attributes, which can depend for their existence on substances. </p>

<p>
In these locations, Descartes affirms an independence criterion of
substancehood. This idea may be implicit in Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Categories</em> and is gestured at by Al Farabi, but Descartes
appears to be the first influential philosopher who explicitly defines
substances as those things that are capable of existing by themselves.
Descartes adds that only God truly qualifies as a substance so
defined, because nothing else could exist without God, a view that
would be reaffirmed with greater emphasis by Descartes&rsquo; most
influential follower, Spinoza. However, Descartes recognises two kinds
of &ldquo;created substance&rdquo; &ndash; things that can exist
without anything else, leaving aside God: material body, which is
defined by extension, and mental substance, which is defined by
thought, which, in this context, is more or less equivalent to
consciousness. </p>

<p>
Descartes believed that matter operates in an entirely mechanical way.
For this reason, he saw no causal role for substantial form to play in
material substances and, hence, no need for such forms. His two
substances are each defined in terms of one property (extension for
matter and thought for mind), hence there is no problem about the
relation between substance and the properties in terms of which it is
defined. Indeed, Descartes asserts that there is no &ldquo;real
distinction&rdquo; between the properties, extension and thought, and
the substances body and mind: a concrete instance of extension
<em>just is</em> one or more bodies, a concrete instance of thought
<em>just is</em>, one or more minds, there is nothing further in which
these substances consist. </p>

<p>
Spinoza and Leibniz, were heavily influenced by Descartes&rsquo; ideas
on substance. Spinoza, like Descartes, asserts that there is only one
substance. This substance is thought of as being both God and Nature.
It is an unending controversy whether Spinoza was a pantheist, or an
atheist who called nature &ldquo;God&rdquo; because it was the one
true substance and existed necessarily. Everything else is a mode of
this one substance. </p>

<p>
The view is analogous to a claim that the universe is space-time as a
whole, with matter as distortions in it. If this were true, material
objects would be modes of space-time. The analogy would be more exact
if one also thought of the laws of nature as equivalent to the divine
intellect immanent in nature. Spinoza&rsquo;s view represents the
extreme end of stressing the status of substance as the fundamental
existent conceived of as wholly necessary and self-subsistent. Nothing
but the universe as a whole meets this criterion fully.</p>

<p>
Leibniz acknowledges created substances, though they are very
intimately dependent on God. In the <em>Discourse on Metaphysics</em>
(&sect; 14), he says:</p>

<blockquote>
it is clear that created substances depend on God, who conserves them
and indeed who produces them continuously by a kind of emanation, just
as we produce our thoughts. (1998: 66)
</blockquote>

<p>
The analogy with thought hardly emphasises the independence of
substance! Nevertheless, created substances do constitute the created
world, and they are also both the subjects of predication and the
bearers of change, albeit in a very different way from
Aristotle&rsquo;s individual substances. An Aristotelian individual
possesses some properties essentially and some accidentally. The
accidental properties of an object are ones that can be gained and
lost over time, and which it might never have possessed at all: its
essential properties are the only ones it had to possess and which it
possesses throughout its existence. By contrast, for Leibniz, even the
properties that an object possesses only for a part of its existence
are essential to it. Every &ldquo;monad&rdquo; (his term for a
substance) bears each of its properties as part of its nature, so if
it were to have been different in any respect, it would have been a
different entity. Furthermore, Leibniz argues that every substance
reflects in its nature the rest of the world, for &ldquo;the result of
each view of the universe, as looked at from a certain position,
is&hellip; a substance which expresses the universe in conformity with
that view.&rdquo; (1998: 66)</p>

<p>
Apart from advancing his own, idiosyncratic account of substance,
Leibniz also advances an objection to Descartes&rsquo; independence
criterion for created substance:</p>

<blockquote>
I do not know whether the definition of substance as that which needs
for its existence only the concurrence of God fits any created
substance known to us. . . . For not only do we need other substances;
we need our own accidents even much more. (<em>Critical Thoughts</em>:
389)
</blockquote>

<p>
According to this objection, a substance cannot exist &ldquo;by
itself&rdquo; (even once we set aside God) because it cannot exist
without its own attributes. As we will see below, this kind of
objection to the independence criterion has been highly influential in
contemporary discussions (Weir 2021: 287&ndash;91).</p>

<h3 id="Lock">2.5 Locke on Substance </h3>

<p>
According to Locke, we have two conceptions of substance. One is a
&ldquo;<em>notion of pure substance in general</em>&rdquo;
(<em>Essay</em> II xxiii 2), the other &ldquo;<em>ideas of particular
sorts of substance</em>&rdquo; (II xxiii 3). Both these conceptions of
substance provide difficulties of interpretation. They also both
relate to issues in contemporary philosophy of substance, in which
Locke&rsquo;s influence is almost as important as
Aristotle&rsquo;s.</p>

<h4 id="LockPureSubsGene">2.5.1 Locke on &ldquo;<em>pure substance in general</em>&rdquo;</h4>

<p>
Locke expresses this idea as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
The idea then we have, to which we give the general name substance,
being nothing, but the supposed, but unknown support of those
qualities, we find existing, which we imagine cannot subsist, <em>sine
re substante</em>, without something to support them, we call that
support <em>substantia</em>, which, according to the true import of
the word, is in plain English, <em>standing under</em> or
<em>upholding</em>. (II xxiii 2)
</blockquote>

<p>
The traditional rationale of Locke&rsquo;s doctrine of
&ldquo;substance in general&rdquo; is as follows. Properties &ndash;
or, in Locke&rsquo;s terms qualities &ndash; must belong to something
&ndash; &ldquo;cannot subsist&hellip;without something to support
them&rdquo;. Of course, they belong to objects, but what are objects
over and above their properties? The special category of substantial
form, as found in Aristotle, is rejected. All that seems to be left is
a bare &ldquo;something&rdquo;, which on pain of regress, has no
properties in its own right, except the property of being the owner or
support of other properties. For a helpful discussion of the
difference between this idea, and the Aristotelian idea of substance
see Broackes (2006).</p>

<p>
This interpretation of Locke&rsquo;s notion of &ldquo;substance in
general&rdquo; is, however, a matter of controversy. It is contested
whether Locke actually believed in substance as a characterless
substratum. Although the first quotation above seems to affirm it,
Locke also in the same section speaks disparagingly about the idea,
comparing it to the notion that the world rests on an elephant, which
rests on a tortoise, and so on: in other words, as not constituting a
real explanation at all. Michael Ayers (1975, 1991b: 39&ndash;50)
believes that the only substratum that Locke acknowledges is the
unknown &ndash; and, Locke thinks, unknowable by us &ndash; structure
of the minute parts. This is what he elsewhere characterises as the
real essence. It is clear from the text that Locke is at least uneasy
with the idea of &ldquo;pure substance in general&rdquo;, but it is
less clear whether he feels obliged to accept an idea he dislikes, or
whether he rejects it. (For the view that he accepts it, and why, see
Bennett 1971 and 1987.)</p>

<p>
There are indications that Locke is confused about what he means by
&ldquo;substratum&rdquo;. He argues that the notion of spiritual
substance is in no worse a predicament than material substance,
because</p>

<blockquote>
<em>we have as clear a notion of the substance of spirit as we have of
body</em>: the one being supposed to be (without knowing what it is)
the <em>substratum</em> to those simple ideas we have from without;
and the other supposed (with a like ignorance of what it is) to be the
<em>substratum</em> to those operations which we experiment in
ourselves within. &lsquo;Tis plain then, that the idea of corporeal
<em>substance</em> in matter, is as remote from our conceptions, and
apprehensions, as that of spiritual <em>substance</em>, or
<em>spirit</em>;&hellip;. (II 23 v)
</blockquote>

<p>
This argument seems to conflate the notions of substratum as pure
logical support with that as minute parts. If he means minute parts,
then, though it is true that we do not and, in his view, cannot know
in detail what they are, we have a theory, which he endorses, that
they are probably minute parts as conceived by the atomists, which
means they have primary qualities similar in kind though not in scale
to those possessed by macroscopic objects. This gives a coherent,
though speculative, conception of material substance. Of spiritual
substance, we have no similar hypothesis. If, on the other hand, he
means pure logical substratum, there is nothing to know, for there is
no more to it, in either the material or spiritual case, than its role
as substratum. He seems to conflate the ignorance we have of minute
parts with the logical emptiness of the idea of pure substratum.</p>

<p>
In fact there are three issues concerning the material underpinning of
things that Locke regards as mysterious, and he seems to move
indifferently from one to the other. First, there is organisation of
the minute parts of particular kinds of objects, which is responsible
for the manifest properties of those objects, and which he thinks will
always fall beyond our knowledge. Second is the mystery of what holds
the minute parts together: the problem of explaining attraction in a
system that only understands influence by impact (xxiii 23). Third, is
that idea of substance as a bare substratum, which is &ldquo;a
supposed, I know not what, to support those ideas we call
accidents&rdquo; (xxiii 15).</p>

<p>
Perhaps it is more profitable to ask whether, in his own terms, Locke
ought to have accepted a bare substratum. If we accept that the
question of what binds together the qualities of a macroscopic object
can be answered by appeal to the minute parts, the issue would then be
what binds the primary qualities of atoms. Do the size, shape, mass,
solidity of a particular atom require a bare substratum to inhere in
for them to constitute a coherent object? Would they, without such a
substratum be just a stack of qualities, a house of cards with nothing
holding them together? There does not seem to be anywhere in the text
where Locke discusses this problem &ndash; that is, the coherence of
atoms as opposed to composite objects &ndash; explicitly. One possible
resort is to treat solidity as the core or master quality and all the
others as features of it. One would never ask what binds together a
patch of colour and its shape, because the shape is the shape of the
colour patch, and, though the shape of something can change, its shape
cannot come away from it, like a separable component (cf. Martin 1980,
Denkel 1992, Weir 2023a: 143&ndash;5). Perhaps the shape, size and
density of an atom are similarly features of the solidity. The quality
solidity would then become equivalent to the notion of material stuff
or material substance and Locke shows no sign of wanting to elide the
ideas of quality and substance in this way, though it should be noted
that this is what Descartes does with extension. For Descartes,
because he does not believe in void, extension carries with it the
other basic properties of matter as features of it.</p>

<h4 id="LockIdeaPartSortSubs">2.5.2 Locke on &ldquo;<em>ideas of particular sorts of substance</em>&rdquo;</h4>

<p>
The ideas of particular sorts of substance &ndash; called
<em>sortals</em> &ndash; are formed</p>

<blockquote>
by collecting such combinations of simple ideas, as are by experience
and observation of men&rsquo;s senses, taken notice of to exist
together, and are therefore supposed to flow from the particular
internal constitution, or unknown essence of that substance. Thus we
come to have the ideas of a man, horse, gold, water,
<em>etc</em>&hellip; (II xxiii 3)
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, for Locke, the real essence is an unknown atomic constitution.
By contrast, the types that we categorise substances in depend on the
properties we happen to be able to perceive and kinds or sorts are
defined in terms of these observable properties. Definition in these
terms Locke calls &ldquo;nominal essence&rdquo;. Our concepts of
natural substances presuppose that the nominal essence hides a real
essence &ndash; that is, that all water, gold, horses etc. are in some
way similar at a microscopic level. But Locke both denies that these
real essences play any role in the formation of our concepts and is
deeply sceptical of our ever being able to discover what they are. His
attitude towards the Aristotelian view is expressed later in the
paragraph just quoted:</p>

<blockquote>
&hellip;a philosopher&hellip;whatever substantial forms he may talk
of, has no other idea of those substances than what is framed by a
collection of those simple ideas which are found in them&hellip;.
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke&rsquo;s doctrine of sortals is in some respects realist and in
some conceptualist or conventionalist. It is realist in at least the
following ways.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
i. The properties [ideas] in terms of which sortals are defined do
correspond to real qualities and powers in the world. There is no
sense in which these building blocks of reality are creatures of our
conceptual scheme.</p>

<p>
ii. The properties invoked by nominal essences are &ldquo;supposed to
flow from the particular internal constitution, or unknown essence of
that substance&rdquo;(xxiii 3). This internal constitution
&ldquo;makes the whole subsist by itself&rdquo; (xxiii 6).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus Locke is entirely realist about individual bodies and their
properties. He is more conventionalist, however, about their
classification under particular sortals. There are four ways in which
he is a conceptualist about particular substances, as we classify
them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
i. There is nothing over and above the properties of an object
corresponding to our substance concepts &ndash; nothing, that is, like
a substantial form &ndash; present in the world. Sortals are entirely
formed by our minds, in the light of the properties perceived to be in
the world.</p>

<p>
ii. The boundaries we draw between kinds of things are, to some degree
at least, arbitrary and concept relative.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I do not deny, but nature, in the constant production of particular
beings, makes them&hellip; very much alike and of kin one to another:
but I think it nevertheless true, that <em>the boundaries of the
species, whereby men sort them, are made by men</em>&hellip; (III vi
37: italics in original)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
iii. The situation in (ii) is greatly aggravated by our ignorance of
real essences. If we could know those more accurately, we would know
better where to draw the boundaries.</p>

<p>
iv. The disposition of properties in nature need not have been as it
is and might actually contain oddities not corresponding to any of our
sortals. Sortals, unlike Aristotelian species, place no constraints on
how individual objects must or ought to be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke&rsquo;s contribution is, therefore, three-fold. He brings to
centre stage the question of whether properties require some
substratum or bare particular to inhere in or belong to. He asserts
that the substantial nature of the physical world is the unknown
structure of atomic parts, not a substantial form which reflects our
usual concepts. Third, he develops a theory of substance which is
realist about particular objects and their properties, but
conceptualist or conventionalist about our classifications, within the
constraints that the facts about particulars and properties
impose.</p>

<p>
There is one important context, however, where Locke does not appear
to talk in a conventionalist way about sortal identity, but in a way
that seems to be reminiscent of substantial forms. This is when he is
discussing the individuation of living things. He understands ordinary
bodies as mereological sums of atoms. As such, any change of particle
constitutes a new object, for a mereological sum is individuated by
its parts and a change of parts means a change of the object
constituted by those parts. Treating ordinary, non-living, bodies as
complex enduring objects is a matter of convention determined by the
concepts we happen to possess. Living things, however, have a deeper
principle of unity.</p>

<blockquote>
That being then one plant which has such an organization of parts in
one coherent body, partaking of one common life, it continues to be
the same plant as long as it partakes of the same life, though that
life be communicated to new particles of matter vitally united to the
living plant&hellip;. (<em>Essay</em> II.27.4)
</blockquote>

<p>
One might wonder what this &ldquo;common life&rdquo; is supposed to
be, especially in the light of his rejection of Aristotelian
&ldquo;substantial forms&rdquo;. Furthermore, it is tempting to argue
that all coherent, solid bodies &ndash; such as a lump of rock or
plasticene &ndash; have some principle of organisation that persists
through change. Living objects are simply the most dramatic case of
this. (Though Peter van Inwagen (1990) defends the view that only
living things and atoms are real entities: inanimate complex bodies
are not true individuals.) Nevertheless, though the appeal to
&ldquo;life&rdquo; seems to modify Locke&rsquo;s conventionalism, it
still leaves open the possibility that the divisions we make between
different species are conventions, because, though we can recognise
life (or a &ldquo;continuing principle of organisation&rdquo;) itself,
it is still relatively arbitrary and concept-dependent where life (or
&ldquo;principle of organisation&rdquo;) of one kind ends and another
starts. So our division of things into species, though grounded in
real continuities in the way that our non-biological (or non-natural)
concepts are not, is still nominal.</p>

<p>
As we shall see, the idea that there is a real unity that is passed on
through the life of an object or through any principle of organisation
is something that Hume criticises and rejects.</p>

<p>
The potential for a stronger realism in Locke has been exploited by
Putnam and Kripke in their development of a modern, essentialist
conception of natural kind terms. Locke was pessimistic in two
connected respects. First he was sceptical about the possibility of
science discovering the nature of the real essences &ndash; the
structures of atoms or molecules &ndash; that underlie kinds of
substance picked out by our ordinary sortals. Second, he doubted
whether the objects picked out by our actual substance concepts really
shared a real essence in the way we assume that they do. He was not
confident, that is, that everything we call gold, or iron, or a
monkey, was actually interestingly similar at a non-superficial level.
More recent work suggests that these forms of pessimism were
unfounded. The consequence of this is the possibility of bringing
together real essence and the sortal concepts originally picked out by
a nominal essence. If we now know water to be H<sub>2</sub>O and iron
to be the element of atomic weight 56, it follows that our substance
concepts were, often at least, tracking real essences in the
world. This involves reinterpreting the rationale of our substance
concepts. Locke thought that our concept of gold was properly
expressed as &ldquo;anything gold in colour, malleable, soluble in
aqua regia&rdquo;. He thought that we add the optimistic assumption
that there will be similarity at the microscopic level. What many
philosophers, under Putnam&rsquo;s influence, now think he should have
said is that gold is <em>that kind of thing which is individuated by a
particular kind of minute structure that underlies</em> the stuff that
is gold in colour, malleable, soluble in aqua regia. In other words,
our confidence that these kinds have a genuine real essence is built
into the concept. If this is correct, then our ordinary &ldquo;natural
kind&rdquo; concepts, like <em>water</em> and <em>gold</em>, have
built into them intimations of a deeper unity than that supplied by
superficial features, even if it be allied to a complete agnosticism
about what that unity might consist in or whether we might ever
uncover it.</p>

<h3 id="HumeKantSubs">2.6 Hume and Kant on substance</h3>

<p>
It is plausible to maintain the general thesis that there are many
issues on which Hume was a sceptic or nihilist, but where his legacy
is more reductionist than sceptical or nihilist. This general thesis
can be explained and illustrated by considering his treatment of
substance, for it is a case in question.</p>

<p>
According to Hume, in the <em>Treatise</em>, our belief in substance
is the result of a mistake or illusion.</p>

<blockquote>
When we gradually follow an object in its successive changes, the
smooth progress of the thought makes us ascribe an identity to the
succession&hellip;When we compare its situation after a considerable
change the progress of the thought is broken; and consequently we are
presented with the idea of diversity: In order to reconcile which
contradictions, the imagination is apt to feign something unknown and
invisible, which it supposes to continue the same under all these
variations; and this unintelligible something it calls a
<em>substance, or original and first matter</em>. (1978: 220)
</blockquote>

<p>
Hume&rsquo;s target is any account that postulates a unifying
&ldquo;something&rdquo; that underlies change, whether this be a
characterless substratum, a substantial form or (though this is not
explicitly mentioned) something like the &ldquo;continuing life&rdquo;
that Locke sees as passed on in living things. The crucial point is
that a succession of very similar things does not constitute the real
continuation of anything, only the illusion of real continuation.</p>

<p>
Thus Hume&rsquo;s treatment of substance is like his treatment of
causation, in that he sees both as the projection onto the world of a
tendency of our minds either to pass from one thing to another or to
associate them in some way. He either doubts that there are such
things as substance or causation (scepticism) or even positively
denies that there are (nihilism). Both arguments resemble much earlier
Buddhist philosophical criticisms of the ideas of substance and
causation mentioned in section 2.3. This may be no coincidence. Alison
Gopnik (2009) suggests Hume was plausibly influenced by Buddhist
philosophy via the Jesuit missionary Charles Fran&ccedil;ois Dolu
during his stay at La Fl&egrave;che, in 1735&ndash;37.</p>

<p>
Out of Hume&rsquo;s very forthright negative attitude there developed
two more subtle variants. One of these variants is in the empiricist
tradition. That tradition modified Hume&rsquo;s approach by developing
it into a form of reductionism. The experiences that gave rise,
through habit, to the mistaken belief (in, for example, substance or
causation) are presented as what the belief really affirms. That is,
the empirical basis for what Hume deems to be an illusion, is
reinterpreted as the reductive account of the concept. Causation then
becomes constant conjunction, or substance a name for a bundle of
properties organised in a certain way or the continuing of the
possibility of certain sensations.</p>

<p>
Kant developed the other variant. He took Hume&rsquo;s
&ldquo;tendencies of the mind to pass&rdquo; from one idea to another,
without which we could not construct the world, and canonised them as
a priori categories of the understanding. Hume&rsquo;s empiricist
emphasis is psychological. It concerns what we are habituated to do.
Because of his empiricism, he will not bring non-psychological
necessity into it. Nevertheless, there is the implication that making
these transitions is the only way in which one <em>can</em> understand
the world. Kant drops the empirical psychology and makes it a matter
of a priori psychology, that only by employing certain categories
could we have experience as of a physical world. It is only by
understanding the world as possessing enduring spatio-temporal
objects, which enter into causal relations with each other (that is,
it is only by applying the categories of substance and causation) that
we can have intelligible experience. Substances &ndash; that is, a
framework of stable, enduring objects &ndash; are essential, but the
source of this necessity lies not in how the world is in itself, but
in the framework that we are obliged to impose.</p>

<p>
In the Kantian philosophy of P. F. Strawson (1959, 1966), this
framework of necessity is taken in a more common-sense and realist
spirit. The world must possess such enduring objects for it to be
intelligible for us &ndash; indeed, for us to be part of it, for we
are essentially stable bodies amongst other stable bodies. The
important point for both Strawson and Kant is that there must be
substances for there to be a coherent empirical, spatio-temporal
world. <em>Substance</em> has become a formal concept of central
importance &ndash; that is a concept with a special central role in
the structure of our conceptual scheme &ndash; rather than being the
name for certain kinds of important things in the world. This
distinction, however, is one that has to be handled carefully,
especially within a realist Kantian framework, such as Strawson
provides. This should become clear below when we discuss
Wiggins&rsquo;s theory, which is both Aristotelian and
Strawsonian.</p>

<h2 id="ContCont">3. Contemporary Controversies</h2>

<p>
Two major areas of controversy require attention. First, there are the
issues concerning how to characterise substance in contradistinction
to properties and the other categories. There are at least two major
questions here. One concerns defining the notion of substance. In
particular, there has been much debate about whether substance can be
accounted for in terms of its special kind of <em>independence</em>.
The other is whether substancehood requires some extra component
beyond properties, (and, if so, what?) or whether a &ldquo;bundle of
properties&rdquo; theory of substance is adequate. Second there is the
relation between substances and our practices of individuation and
reidentification. In particular, we shall look at the issue of whether
objects must be individuated under the kind of sortal expressions that
correspond to Aristotelian substance concepts, or whether a more
generic notion, such as <em>physical body</em>, will suffice. This
latter concern will lead on to a consideration of the connection
between substance and teleology.</p>

<h3 id="HowSubsDistThinOtheCate">3.1. How substances are distinguished from things in other categories</h3>

<p>
A central issue in contemporary discussions of substance is how to
distinguish substances from other categories. Multiple criteria of
substancehood have been proposed. O&rsquo;Conaill (2022: 11&ndash;42)
provides a detailed overview.</p>

<p>
The most discussed criterion for substancehood is independence. A
natural formulation of the independence criterion says that what
distinguishes substances from properties is that properties depend for
their existence on substances, for they are properties <em>of
objects</em> (that is, of individual substances), but that substances
do not similarly depend on properties for their existence. The point
cannot be made quite so simply, however. Properties could not exist
without objects to be properties of, but neither could substances
exist without properties, so the dependence appears to be mutual. This
objection to the independence criterion makes an early appearance in
Leibniz, as mentioned in section 2.4, and has had a significant impact
in recent discussions (see Weir 2021: 287&ndash;91). </p>

<p>
One response, recommended by Rodriquez-Pereyra (2008: 81); Bennett
(2001: 134) and Schechtman (2016: 183), is to make it clear that we
are not talking about properties in general and substances in general,
but about particular instances or cases of a property and the
particular objects to which they belong. A particular property
instance cannot exist and could not have existed without the substance
of which it is a property, but the particular substance can exist and
could have existed without that property instance. Thus, a particular
instance of colour cannot exist, and could not have existed, without
the object of which it is the colour, but the object can exist without
the colour instance, for it may change colour and remain the same
object, or it could have had a different colour from the start. </p>

<p>
A second solution, advanced by Lowe (1998) in his very thorough
discussion of all the topics discussed in this section, replaces the
notion of mere independence with independence of
<em>identity</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>x</em> is a substance if and only if <em>x</em> is a particular
and there is no particular <em>y</em> such that <em>y</em> is not
identical to <em>x</em> and the identity of <em>x</em> depends on the
identity of <em>y</em>.
</blockquote>

<p>
A property depends for its identity on the substance to which it
belongs whereas, according to Lowe, the substance does not depend for
its identity on its properties. </p>

<p>
A problem for either solution is that of essential properties. Both
versions of the independence criterion imply that, for any given
property-instance, a substance can exist without it, or does not
depend for its identity on it, neither of which seems true of the
essential properties of substances. </p>

<p>
Lowe responds by saying that essential properties are identical with
the substance, so cannot be cited as something other than substance
that meets his criterion for being substance. It is not clear that
this will work. The idea that the essence is identical with the
substance is Aristotelian, but it is not clear how this applies to
essential properties, taken individually. We have already seen, in our
discussion of Aristotle, that the relation between the essence as some
kind of unity and the properties that seem to constitute it is not
clear.</p>

<p>
A third solution to the problem of formulating the identity criterion,
which purports to avoid either objection just raised, is put forward
by Gorman (2006) and Weir (2021, 2023a: 58&ndash;76). According to
this solution, the independence criterion should be interpreted as
saying that a substance, unlike a property, can exist &ldquo;by
itself&rdquo; in the sense that it can exist without anything it does
not include or subsume within itself. It may be true of a substance
that it can exist by itself in this sense, despite its inability to
exist without even its essential parts and properties. For the parts
and properties are subsumed by the substance to which they belong. By
contrast, a property cannot exist by itself in this sense because a
property cannot exist without belonging to a substance that it does
not include or subsume.</p>

<p>
A problem for all three versions of the independence criterion is that
they do not distinguish between substances and events. The performance
of a symphony, for example, is an event, and it may possess the
property, in one of its movements, of being allegro. It seems
plausible that this particular case of something&rsquo;s being allegro
could not have been exemplified by another performance, but the
performance might go on to be andante in another movement, so the
event can continue to exist without that original property. Hence, it
seems that the event is a substance.</p>

<p>
The idea that an event might be a substance is at odds with a second
traditional criterion of substancehood: that of being a
&ldquo;continuant&rdquo; rather than an &ldquo;occurrent&rdquo;. It
does not seem natural to say that the same event was first allegro,
then andante, because it is more natural to attribute the different
properties to different parts of the event, which are themselves
events (in this case, <em>movements</em>). This brings out a major
difference between traditional examples of substances and events,
namely that the temporal parts of events are themselves events in
their own right, but the temporal parts of objects &ndash; meaning by
that expression the temporal phases of an object&rsquo;s existence
&ndash; are not themselves objects. Indeed, it is not natural to talk
of the temporal parts of objects, though some philosophers (led by
David Lewis (1986), but see also Sider (2001), Hawley (2001) and the
entry on
 <a href="../temporal-parts/">temporal parts</a>)
 think that there are compelling philosophical reasons for doing so.
</p>

<p>
One solution to this further problem is to combine the independence
criterion and a continuant criterion. On this view, we will treat
independence as distinguishing substances and events from properties,
while saying that events are those property-instantiators that, when
they exist through time, are temporally composed of further things of
the same category (i.e., events), whereas substances are those
property-instantiators that, when they exist through time, are not
temporally composed of things of the same category (i.e., of
substances) but endure singly through the period. Alternatively, one
might seek some other characteristic of events that distinguishes them
from substances. For example, if events are structures of objects,
properties/relations, and times, substances might be defined as those
independent entities that are not structures of the relevant sort.</p>

<p>
A final problem that has been raised for the independence criterion of
substance is that it seems unable to cope with the necessity of origin
for individual identity. Lowe (1998) responds by denying that origin
is essential to identity. Unfortunately, he argues for this position
by citing human subjects: Socrates, for example, would still have been
who he was even if he had had different parents. This is, of course,
controversial about humans, but it is our Cartesian intuitions that
make it plausible in that case. That this table, for example, could
have been the same object even if made from different material does
not have the same plausibility. Gorman (2006: 152), Schneider (2006:
400) and Weir (2021: 305&ndash;6) all respond by stipulating that a
substance need only be capable of continuing its existence by itself,
not of existing by itself for the entirety of its existence. </p>

<p>
Hoffman and Rosenkrantz (1994 and 1997) develop a particularly
sophisticated conception of the relative independence of substances
compared to other categories. Substance, they say, is the only
category of thing that might have only one instance through at least a
minimally extended period of time. Thus, for example, there is no
possible world that has, in a given period of time, only one event,
for any non-instantaneous event will be made of events that are its
parts. Similarly for properties or tropes, there can never be only one
because any one entails the existence of others, as, for example, the
existence of a red property (instance) entails the existence of (an
instance of) the property colour. By contrast, there could exist
through a period of time just one substance, provided that it was
atomic.</p>

<p>
As Mackie (2000) points out, the full statement of this theory
involves various relatively ad hoc restrictions. More importantly, it
does not seem to explain what unifies the category of substance, for
it does not say that it is true of any substance that it could
conceivably be the only substance existing for a period of time
&ndash; indeed, it could not apply to non-atomic substances, for
complex ones can exist only if other substances &ndash; those that
constitute their parts &ndash; also exist. It implies only that
<em>something</em> from the category of substance might so exist and
that this could not be true of any other category. One might wonder
what enabled substances that could not exist alone to count as
substances at all.</p>

<p>
The independence and continuant criteria are not the only criteria for
substancehood discussed in recent literature. An alternative criterion
for substancehood that has quickly become important is that of
<em>ungroundedness</em>. One fact or thing is said to be
&ldquo;grounded&rdquo; by a second fact or thing when the first exists
or obtains &ldquo;in virtue of&rdquo; the second. The notion of
grounding, so defined, is imprecise, and there exists much
disagreement about how to further clarify it. Nonetheless, the last
decade or two have witnessed widespread interest in the idea that many
important metaphysical problems will be solved or illuminated by
appeal to the notion of grounding. One possible application of this
notion is in the suggestion that substances are those things that are
fundamental in the sense that they are not grounded by anything
further. O&rsquo;Conaill (2022: 24&ndash;5) discusses two grounding
definitions of substance drawn from Schaffer (2009) and Schneider
(2006).</p>

<p>
A final traditional criterion for substancehood that continues to
receive some support is unity. In its extreme form, defended by
Schaffer (2021) and Heil (2021, 21), this criterion says that a
substance must be a mereological simple &ndash; that is, something
with no proper parts. A more moderate version of the unity criterion
advanced by Koslicki (2018) associates substancehood with the kind of
unity exhibited by hylomorphic compounds. Neo-hylomorphic conceptions
of substance such as Koslicki&rsquo;s are given their own section in
 <a href="#SubsTele">3.4</a>
 below.</p>

<h3 id="BundTheoVersSubsThinPart">3.2 Bundle theories versus substrata and &ldquo;<em>thin particulars</em>&rdquo;</h3>

<p>
A second important issue in contemporary discussions of substance is
whether substances are in some sense reducible to their properties, or
whether there exists some further component, such as Locke&rsquo;s
notion of a substratum discussed in
 <a href="#SubsSort">section 2.5</a>.
 Both views have been defended in recent discussions.</p>

<h4 id="BundTheoTheiProb">3.2.1 Bundle theories and their problems</h4>

<p>
Properties might be conceived of as universals, things that can be
instantiated in multiple bearers at the same time, or as individuals,
property-instances, which are sometimes called &ldquo;tropes&rdquo;.
There are, therefore, two options for the bundle theorist.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
i. Substances are in fact no more than bundles of properties conceived
of as universals.
<br />
ii. Substances are in fact no more than bundles of properties
conceived of as individuals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On either view, the claim that substances are &ldquo;no more than
bundles of properties&rdquo; might be regarded as a conceptual
analysis of the concept of substance, or it might be regarded as a de
facto, but not a conceptual truth. The claim that substances are
&ldquo;no more than bundles of properties&rdquo; means, at minimum,
that there is no further component or ingredient which goes to make up
a substance, beyond its various properties. The term &ldquo;bundle
theory&rdquo; is sometimes used to suggest a stronger view on which
the properties are in some sense more fundamental than, and perhaps
capable of existing separately from the substance to which they
belong. Hume argues that what we usually think of as individual
substances are really bundles of properties in this strong sense. As
he acknowledges, it follows that the properties will themselves be
substances according to definitions that make separability a criterion
of substancehood.</p>

<p>
The main objections to the claim that substances are bundles of
universal properties rest on its apparent commitment to the Identity
of Indiscernibles, for if an object is no more than a bundle of
properties, then if a and b have exactly the same properties, they are
the same bundle. Whether it does carry this commitment may depend on
whether one allows spatial points as particulars, in addition to the
properties that are universal. If one did, then the universal theories
would not entail the identity of indiscernibles, for the same
universals could be in two bundles by being at two different
locations. In this case, however, it is not clear why the properties
themselves should be regarded as universals rather than individuals,
on the basis that they too are present at different locations (see
Weir 2021: 270&ndash;1).</p>

<p>
If properties are conceived of as individuals &ndash; otherwise known
as tropes, property-instances or individualised forms &ndash; then
there cannot be a problem about the distinctness of exactly similar
bundles, for the difference is built into the identity of the elements
of the bundle, as it is not if the bundle is made of universals. The
problem for this version of the bundle theory seems to be that it is
difficult to individuate or distinguish tropes in a way that makes
them suitable to be individuals &ndash; in one sense, the substances
&ndash; from which objects are made (Armstrong 1989: 115ff). For
example, if an object has a size, a mass, and a motion, are the size
and the mass different tropes and is it not strange to think of the
size alone as a genuine particular suited to be treated as an
&ldquo;atomic&rdquo; component of the whole? One way out of this
problem may be to resort to the notion of a master property that was
invoked in the discussion of Locke on substratum
 (<a href="#SubsSort">section 2.1.5</a>);
 that is, to the notion of one property of which all the others are
modes, as extension is the master property of matter for Descartes. It
might be argued that theories of this kind are not ordinary bundle
theories, however, there is a sense in which the master property fills
the role of substratum, while the other properties inhere in, or are
modes of, it.</p>

<p>
One objection often made against the theory is that the identity of a
bundle, like that of a mereological sum, is determined by its members.
It follows that on the bundle theory, any change of property is a
change in the identity of the substance to which it belongs. And yet,
it is ordinarily assumed that substances can survive through changes
in property. Various forms of essentialist solutions to this problem
have been suggested, for example, by Simons (1994), and Barker and
Jago (2018).</p>

<h4 id="ConcSubsThinPart">3.2.2. The concept of substratum or &ldquo;thin particular&rdquo;</h4>

<p>
If one is not satisfied with a bundle theory of substance, so that one
thinks that an individual substance is more than a collection of
properties, how is one to understand this &ldquo;more&rdquo;? This
question can be given a deflationary or a substantive answer. The
deflationary answer is that a substance is a <em>thing which has</em>
properties, and that is all one needs to say (see, for example, Crane
and Farkas 2004: 143f, and Chisholm 1969, cf. Broackes 2006). An
object is not composed of properties and some further ingredient
&ndash; the &ldquo;thingy&rdquo; bit &ndash; an object is something
that simply has properties. Any feature of it can, of course, be
regarded as a property, but that does not render an object nothing but
a collection of properties. There seems to be a clash of intuitions at
this point about what makes sense. An opponent of the deflationary
view will say that properties, however understood, must be components
of objects, conceptually or formally speaking. If they are not the
only components in this sense, one must say something about the nature
of the rest. The deflationist thinks that this line of thought
embodies some kind of category mistake in the way it handles the idea
of a component. The anti-deflationist will argue that the fact that we
are talking about components only in a conceptual sense does not alter
the fact that we are obliged, once we start, to offer an account that
is complete and distinguishes the various elements.</p>

<p>
Bennett offers one way out of the need to postulate a mysterious
substratum:</p>

<blockquote>
When I say &lsquo;This is an orange&rsquo; I mean that there are here
instances of certain properties such as orangeness, sphericality etc.,
and I indicate that I am <em>operating on my ideas of those instances
in a certain combining manner</em>. (1987: 202; italics added)
</blockquote>

<p>
This solution, as Bennett recognises, makes substancehood a function
of how we operate on the properties we perceive. It is, in that sense,
more Kantian than realist. As what it recognises as out there in the
world is just a bundle of properties, it does not dissolve the problem
in the way that a deflationist would require.</p>

<p>
Substantive theories take the thought of a further component
seriously, and, though they are not generally distinguished, there are
two main conceptions of this extra element, which I will call the
&ldquo;thin particular&rdquo; and the &ldquo;substratum&rdquo;
conceptions. &ldquo;Thin particular&rdquo; is an expression of D. M.
Armstrong&rsquo;s. It is the particular in abstraction from its
properties. When considered with its properties it is a <em>thick
particular</em>. The important point is that thin particulars really
are particulars. &ldquo;Bertrand Russell might have been a fried
egg&rdquo;: that is, the thin particular associated with one set of
properties and, hence, with one thing, might have belonged to another.
Different properties might have been hung on this hook. It is not so
clear, by contrast, that a substratum of the kind Locke considers, or
like Aristotle&rsquo;s prime matter, is a particular in this sense. It
is more like a kind of stuff &ndash; the substantiveness on to which
properties are impressed. On this conception, the suggestion that the
&ldquo;piece&rdquo; of substratum or &ldquo;prime matter&rdquo; that
is <em>here</em> in object <em>a</em>, might always instead have been
<em>there</em> in object <em>b</em>, seems to lack content.</p>

<p>
It is useful at this point to take note of the three different
functions the thin particular or substratum might fulfil. Its role
might be (i) to bind the properties into a unity, so that they do not
&ldquo;fall apart&rdquo; as C. B. Martin (1980) suggests: (ii) to
individualise them, if they are universals, as Gustav Bergman (1947)
proposed: (iii) to carry one across the categorial barrier from
property to substance; that is, to be what it is that makes something
to be in the category of substance.</p>

<p>
The first role will not be necessary if one thinks that there is a
&ldquo;master property&rdquo; of which the others are modes, or if one
thinks that unity can come from some causal or organisational
connection. (ii) will not apply to a tropist theory, or if one thinks
that location will do the job. (iii) rests on the intuition that no
collection of <em>properties</em> could, in themselves, amount to a
<em>substance</em>: the very idea is a category mistake, and only the
presence of a special &ldquo;substantializing&rdquo; element could do
that. It might be argued that this intuition begs the question against
the bundle theory.</p>

<h3 id="SubsSort">3.3 Substances and sortals</h3>

<p>
As we mentioned in section 3.2, Aristotle&rsquo;s analysis of
substance into matter and form &ndash; his &ldquo;hylomorphism&rdquo;
&ndash; can be thought of as a version of the substratum theory. It
might make sense, therefore, to include contemporary hylomorphism in
the foregoing section. However, neo-Aristotelian views also emphasise
a second feature of Aristotle&rsquo;s approach which deserves to be
covered before moving onto hylomorphism.</p>

<p>
The Aristotelian tradition anchors the concept of substance, at least
in nature, primarily to instances of species of natural object. The
Kantian tradition ties it to those enduring bodies the individuation
of which gives sense and structure to our spatio-temporal framework.
David Wiggins (1967, 1980, 2001) has made a sustained attempt to prove
that these two objectives necessarily go together and to make the
Aristotelian notion of substance, even including its bias towards the
biological, central to our practice of individuating objects.</p>

<p>
Wiggins assumes that individuating a temporally enduring object
involves being able to re-identify it at different times and under
different descriptions. This assumption makes it possible to state
substance individuation using the language of identity. Within the
scope of this assumption, he makes two claims. The first is the sortal
relativity of identity: that is, when any <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>
are asserted to be the same thing, they must be the same
<em>something-or-other</em>, and the <em>something-or-other</em> must
be the kind of concept that answers &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;
questions. In other words, there is no such a thing as &ldquo;bare
identity&rdquo; &ndash; identity under no concept at all. Furthermore,
the relevant concept must be an Aristotelian substance concept or
sortal. More formally, this can be expressed as follows:</p> If
<em>a</em> = <em>b</em> then there is a sortal <em>F</em> such that:

<ol type="i">

<li><em>a</em> is an <em>F</em></li>

<li><em>b</em> is an <em>F</em></li>

<li><em>a</em> is the same <em>F</em> as <em>b</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The second claim is that if the object picked out by
&ldquo;<em>a&rdquo; </em>also falls under another sortal, <em>G</em>,
then so will the object picked out by &ldquo;<em>b&rdquo;</em>, and it
will be the same <em>G</em> as <em>a</em>. This is represented as an
application of Leibniz&rsquo;s Law, for if <em>a</em> is
the-same-<em>G</em>-as-<em>a</em> (as it must be) then, as <em>a</em>
= <em>b</em>, <em>b</em> must be the-same-<em>G</em>-as-<em>a</em>.
Hence for any sortal <em>G</em>:</p>

<ol type="i">

<li><em>a</em> is <em>G</em> iff <em>b</em> is <em>G</em>,</li>

<li>if <em>a</em> is <em>G</em> then <em>b</em> is the same <em>G</em>
as <em>a</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The conclusion is striking because it is a denial that <em>a</em> and
<em>b</em> might be identical under one form of identification, but
not under another. In fact it implies that every individuable object
falls under just one ultimate sortal. (Wiggins admits this in 2001: 67
n.7. What is meant by <em>ultimate</em> sortal will emerge below.) For
every ultimate sortal has its own principle of individuation, and if
an object fell under more than one, there could be a time at which it
satisfied the criteria for one and not for the other. Wiggins&rsquo;s
thesis is a very strong claim, apparently backed up by a powerful
argument. It is a strong claim for it purports to prove that any world
with individuable objects must be constituted by Aristotelian
substances. The argument is powerful because it follows by simple
logic, granted seemingly plausible claims about identity, and
Leibniz&rsquo;s Law.</p>

<p>
On the other hand, there seem to be many cases of objects, which can
be identified under a variety of concepts, leading to different life
histories. This is termed <em>relativity of identity</em>. For
example, <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> may be the same person but not the
same child because <em>b</em> is a grown up and no longer a child. Or
<em>a</em> and <em>b</em> may be the same lump of clay but not the
same statue because <em>b</em> is the lump after it has been reshaped
out of its statue shape. These are the most typical kinds of counter
examples and Wiggins has responses to both. He deals with the first by
invoking the concept of a <em>phase sortal</em>. A phase sortal is one
that, by its meaning, denotes part of the life history of something,
which, as a whole, is denoted by another sortal. So <em>child</em> is
a phase sortal that applies to a phase of the things fully designated
by <em>human being</em>. This illuminates an important aspect of the
concept of a sortal. It is a necessary condition for
<em>F</em>&rsquo;s being an ultimate sortal that, whenever it applies
to something, it applies in a present-tensed manner to the thing
through the whole of its existence.</p>

<p>
The statue and the lump of clay are dealt with by denying that the
lump and the statue are identical: the lump of clay
<em>constitutes</em> the statue, but is not identical with it. Notice
that he could have argued that the statue was just a phase of the
lump, but he does not do so because <em>statue</em> is not, by its
very meaning, a phase sortal: <em>statue</em>, unlike <em>child</em>,
does not indicate by its meaning a period in the existence of
something.</p>

<p>
So Wiggins deals with objections mainly by two distinctions. One is
between sortals that apply to objects through the whole of their
existence, and sortals appropriate only to a phase of their existence:
the other is between the &ldquo;is&rdquo; of identity and the
&ldquo;is&rdquo; of constitution. Correspondingly, criticism centres
on whether the concepts under which we pick things out behave in as
regimented a way as Wiggins requires, and on whether the
&ldquo;is&rdquo; of constitution is sufficiently different from the
&ldquo;is&rdquo; of identity to perform the task he wants of it.
Wiggins&rsquo; views are discussed further in the following

<h3 id="ContHylo">3.4 Contemporary hylomorphism</h3>

<p>
Since about the mid-1990s there has developed a debate covering
similar territory to that discussed by Wiggins, but having rather
different roots. It claims to be a revival of a broadly Aristotelian
hylomorphism, but it comes mainly from disputes in mereology. A
detailed overview of the topic and a defence of a bold scientifically
informed form of contemporary hylomorphism can be found in Simpson
(2021, 2023).</p>

<p>
David Lewis famously propounded the doctrine of Unrestricted
Composition: that is, any combination of things in the world
constitutes a further thing (e.g., 1986: 211). So my left foot and any
arbitrary stone at the bottom of the sea constitutes an object, though
an object of no descriptive or explanatory interest. In the opposite
corner, Peter van Inwagen (1990) denied that there was any such thing
as composition, at least for inanimate material objects.</p>

<p>
Van Inwagen&rsquo;s main argument is that necessary and sufficient
(particularly sufficient) conditions cannot be given for the kind of
cohesion of parts that is supposed to bind atoms into complexes. None
of the standard candidates &ndash; contact, fastening, adhesion,
fusion, nor any acceptable disjunction of them &ndash; will suffice.
They all have counterexamples. So the notion cannot be well defined.
The arguments are subtle and interesting. The question might be raised
whether van Inwagen gives sufficient consideration to the possibility
of taking a line similar to that taken by Putnam on natural kinds. One
fixes putative paradigm cases of non-living complexes, and says that
the kind of cohesion required is whatever sort of bonding holds in
those cases. It seems unlikely that there will not be a reasonably
tidy, scientific account of how atoms bond. Nevertheless, van
Inwagen&rsquo;s mereological nihilism has a stopping point, namely
that he believes that he, though a composite material object, really
does exist. So organisms do exist.</p>

<p>
Van Inwagen&rsquo;s unwillingness (unlike the early Unger (1975)) to
apply the nihilism to himself, and others like him, prompted the
thought in other philosophers that there may be a way of having a
doctrine of Restricted Composition on the basis of being things of the
right kind &ndash; namely having a structure of the right kind &ndash;
and that this idea resembled Aristotle&rsquo;s notion of form and his
doctrine of hylomorphism. Philosophers following this line of thought
included Fine (1999, 2010), Johnston (2006), Lowe (2011), Koslicki
(2008, 2018), Rea (2011) and Jaworski (2011, 2012). It is difficult to
provide a compact account of these philosophers&rsquo; positions, as
it can seem that all they have in common is a belief in some form of
restricted composition and a sense that the Aristotelian label
&ldquo;hylomorphism&rdquo; helps to give their theories a pedigree.
Our strategy here will be to illustrate modern hylomorphism mainly
using the examples of Jaworski and Johnston, then citing a major
problem for any theory of this general kind, and illustrating this by
reference to Marmodoro (2013), where good discussions of Lowe,
Koslicki and Rea can be found. Following this we outline
Simpson&rsquo;s (2023) defence of a more ambitious version of
hylomorphism that attempts to avoid the main problem facing other
theories.</p>

<p>
For most contemporary hylomorphists the notion that plays the crucial
role in restricting composition is <em>structure</em>. Jaworski
probably deploys this notion in the most straightforward way. He and
Rea both use the following illustration. If you compact a human being
in a machine or waterproof bag, you retain the same matter, but lose
the human being, because you have destroyed the structure. Structure
is, therefore, a real and essential element in many or most complex
objects. He explains his theory as follows.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Hylomorphism claims&hellip;[t]hat structure is a basic ontological and
explanatory category. (2011: 169)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Structure is also a basic explanatory principle in that it explains
why members of this or that kind are able to engage in the behaviors
they do. It is because humans are organized as they are, for instance,
that they are able to speak, to learn, to engage in the range of
activities that distinguish them from other living things and from
non-living ones. (2011: 172)</p>

<p>
Most influential contemporary hylomorphists would agree with these
statements, but they each have their own way of stating the theory and
it is not easy to fit them together. Johnston&rsquo;s central account
is as follows.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A statement of the genuine parts and principle of unity of an
item&hellip;takes the following canonical form:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>What it is for</em>&hellip;(the item is specified
here)&hellip;<em>to be is for</em>&hellip;(some parts are specified
here)...<em>to have the property or stand in the
relation</em>&hellip;(the principle of unity is specified here).
</blockquote>

<p>
As in: <em>What it is for</em> this hydrochloric acid molecule <em>to
be is for</em> this positive hydrogen ion and this negative chlorine
ion <em>to</em> be bonded together. &hellip; The idea that each
complex item will have some such canonical statement true of it might
be fairly called &lsquo;Hylomorphism&rsquo;. For it is the idea that
each complex item admits of a real definition, or statement of its
essence, in terms of its matter, understood as parts or components,
and its form, understood as a principle of unity. (2006: 658)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But Johnston&rsquo;s notion of a &ldquo;principle of unity&rdquo;
turns out to be so generous that his theory almost collapses into
Lewis&rsquo;s.</p>

<blockquote>
Consider then all the myriad ways of constructing putative wholes from
items gravitationally related to other items. Are they all genuine
wholes? Given Hylomorphism, there does not seem to be any happy way to
insist that they are not all <em>wholes</em>, even though very few of
them will be material objects or stable physical systems&hellip; A
whole consisting of your eyeglasses and Pluto is too far from [normal
physical object] paradigms in respect of compactness and maximality to
count as a genuine whole in the ordinary sense. But it is fully,
completely and <em>genuinely</em> true that it is a whole. (2006: 697)
</blockquote>

<p>
One might wonder whether such an apparatus preserves what one might
want to save from a common-sense notion of composition.</p>

<p>
A general worry about the hylomorphist approach might be put as
follows. The modern hylomorphists do not claim to be interpreting
Aristotle, but to be inspired by his concept of form. This means that
it is out of place simply to argue that they have not interpreted him
in a scholarly fashion. Nevertheless, it is relevant to point it out
if they have totally misunderstood his deployment of the concept of
form, for if this is the case, it might suggest that they are
pretending to a solution to the composition problem that they do not
possess. Someone who was sceptical about their claim to a solution
might start by pointing out that the moderns typically reject the
&ldquo;traditional&rdquo; Aristotelian idea that form has a role as an
efficient cause, actually making a difference to the way that its
matter behaves. They deny this because they all want their theories to
be consistent with the closure of the world under physics: the view
that all effects are brought about by microphysical causes in
accordance with physical laws. At the same time, they seem to intend
their composites to have full ontological weight, and to have causal
efficacy.</p>

<p>
Jaworski is particularly clear in emphasising that he is a
<strong>causal pluralist</strong> and that the structural level is in
no sense epiphenomenal or a mere logical construct out of the lower
properties (see his 2011: 174). But one might query whether this is
consistent with accepting the possibility of closure under physics.
Such closure naturally raises the question of the causal claims made
for form or structure, and, hence, for their ontological weight. The
importance of <em>explanations</em> at the level of complex structures
is not disputed, but whether these represent just ways of
<em>conceptualising</em> a fundamental level that we cannot normally
access, is another matter. Johnston raises this question (2006:
660&ndash;62) but leaves it unresolved. Jaworski insists on causal
pluralism, but admits &ldquo;all forces are operating at a fundamental
physical level&rdquo;: This latter remark seems to concede that what
one has in fact is an <em>explanatory</em> pluralism, with causation
included in the domain of explanation, but all the brute
<em>force</em> confined to physics. Johnston is keen to deny that
<em>explanation</em> is a subjective or psychological phenomenon, but
admitting this does not place explanation in the world, in the sense
in which the forces that actually make things happen are in the world:
it only gives them the Platonic objectivity of propositions or
theories.</p>

<p>
It seems that modern hylomorphism faces the following dilemma. The
following argument has appeal.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
1. The concept of structure is essential to all or most natural
sciences.
<br />
2. If something is essential to a valid mode of explanation or
understanding, then it should be conceived realistically.</p>

<p>
therefore</p>

<p>
3. There are real structures in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But the following also has appeal.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
4. It is sufficient for the concept of structure to be applicable that
elements be appropriately arranged in the world, and these
arrangements can be characterised without employing the notion of
structure. This could be done by specifying the spatio-temporal
location of the elements and their causal influence on each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If (4) is correct, it looks as if, though our structural concepts are
well grounded in reality, structures are not part of the basic
furniture of the world. This is, in fact, the same issue as whether
Kim&rsquo;s exclusion principle applies to the special sciences: that
is, if physics gives a sufficient causal account of the location of
all matter, are the other sciences merely heuristics, but strictly
epiphenomenal? (See Kim 2005, Robinson 2014, Simpson 2023:
29&ndash;32) Perhaps the status of form and structure cannot be solved
in a modern context without solving the exclusion issue.</p>

<p>
Anna Marmodoro (2013) argues that the modern hylomorphists have
misunderstood Aristotle in a radical fashion, in a way that is
directly connected with their concern about the unity and hence
reality of composites. She claims, with strong backing from the text,
that form is not structure, because it is not a combination of parts.
The essence of form is its unity, and its unity depends essentially on
the fact that the matter that comes to compose it loses its previous
identity. By contrast, in any kind of structure of parts this identity
is not lost; the parts are merely organised in a certain way.</p>

<p>
On this interpretation, Aristotle must deny the core of (4), which is
that the behaviour of complexes derives necessarily from the primitive
causal powers of the elements and their spatial relations &ndash; this
is a &ldquo;bottom up&rdquo; atomist principle, and presupposes that
the parts retain their identity within composites. But without this
core idea in (4), it is difficult to see how there can be
&ldquo;closure under physics&rdquo;, for if the atoms did not retain
their identity, how could the nomic structure that rests on them be
preserved?</p>

<p>
There seems to be, therefore, a tension between two principles the
modern hylomorphists seem to want to preserve. The tension is between
the role of form as the creator of a genuine, non-conventional unity
in composites, and an openness to the modern belief in the closure of
the world under physics.</p>

<p>
A modern hylomorphist who takes seriously the tension between the
thesis that form plays a genuine causal role and the principle that
all effects are brought about by microphysical causes is William
Simpson (2021, 2023). Simpson (2023: 32&ndash;4) argues that positions
such as Jaworkski&rsquo;s that invoke causal pluralism to reconcile
hylomorphism with closure under physics fail to give form the genuine
causal role that would earn it a place in our ontology. Instead, he
argues that hylomorphists should reevaluate the idea that the material
world is closed under physics in the first place. Though it may be an
entrenched orthodoxy among analytical philosophers, closure under
physics does not follow from our best theory of the behaviour of
matter: quantum mechanics. Rather, the implications of quantum
mechanics for closure under physics depend on the specific
interpretation of the theory one adopts and, in particular, how that
interpretation deals with the &ldquo;measurement problem&rdquo;: the
problem of explaining how macroscopic devices come to register
determinate measurement outcomes when the Schrodinger equation only
describes a distribution of probabilities. According to the physicist
Barbara Drossel and cosmologist George Ellis&rsquo;s contextual wave
function collapse theory, determinate measurement outcomes occur
because macroscopic objects act on microscopic objects in a manner
that is not itself governed by the microphysical laws. Drossel and
Ellis&rsquo;s theory is empirically equivalent to other
interpretations of quantum mechanics and so, Simpson argues,
hylomorphists are not obliged to reconcile their position with the
thesis that all forces are microphysical. Instead, drawing on the work
of Koons (2014, 2022 [Other Internet Resources]), Simpson proposes a
version of hylomorphism that treats macroscopic substances as
fundamental physical entities with causal powers that would not be
expected on the basis of microphysics and are irreducible to the
powers of their microscopic parts (Simpson 2021, 2023:
41&ndash;4).</p>

<h3 id="SubsTele">3.5 Substance and teleology</h3>

<p>
There is one mark of substance that was important to Aristotle that we
have not discussed. This is the connection between substance and
teleology; that is, the notion that <em>what something is</em> is
intimately connected with its natural purpose, end or function. The
association with teleology does not naturally recommend itself to the
modern mind. Wiggins, for example, says that &ldquo;it would have been
both possible and advantageous for Aristotle to distance [his account
of substance] from his concern with final causes&hellip;&rdquo; (2001:
80). The concern with teleology is presumably thought to be too
closely connected with Aristotle&rsquo;s theology, or the idea that it
is divine design or intelligence that gives natural objects their
ends. Nevertheless, it is not easy for an Aristotelian to make a
complete break from teleology, and some contemporary Aristotelians
have defended the compatibility of a teleological conception of
substance with a scientific account of the natural world (e.g. Simpson
2023: 45&ndash;63).</p>

<p>
Teleology is what distinguishes living things that act for purposes
and have organs with functions from lumps and rocks, and it is the
former that Aristotelians see as the paradigm substances. It is no
accident, therefore, that artefacts, which are generally defined by
their function, are often cited as good illustrations &ndash; even if
not paradigm cases &ndash; of substances. So we have a tension
developing. On the one hand, lumps and rocks are good paradigm cases
of our notion of natural enduring objects. But they are bad cases of
objects with purposes or ends. Artefacts are good cases of things with
purposes, and are reasonably enduring, but are not natural objects.
Living things come near to getting the best of both worlds. They are
natural and enduring, and they have purposes, in the sense of natural
goals in their behaviour. (Although, according to the modern
perspective they do not possess a final end, unlike artefacts: a knife
is for cutting, but there is nothing a dog is <em>for</em>, though it
has many ends <em>en passant</em>.)</p>

<p>
This teleological approach to substance could be expressed as the view
that the substances in a given system are those entities crucial from
the teleological or design perspective of that system.
&ldquo;Crucial&rdquo;, here, means that other things exist either to
constitute them or to provide a context of operations for them.</p>

<p>
The tension between the teleological mark of the substantial and the
others we have considered might make it useful to distinguish between
<em>descriptive ontological priority</em> and <em>teleological
ontological priority</em>. The former is interested in a purely
descriptive account of what exists, and it, therefore, rates as the
substances those entities that a purely descriptive science would
count as basic. The latter, however, counts as substances those things
that are deemed fundamental because of the role or function they play
in the world. This contrast is most plain in the case of artefacts. An
artefact is made of its parts, and, in a sense, they are more basic
than it because they constitute it. But if there were not artefacts of
the appropriate kind, those parts would never have come into
existence: if there were no motor cars, there would be no steering
wheels or accelerator pedals. Thus, like Aristotle&rsquo;s severed
finger (<em>Metaphysics</em> 1035b 23&ndash;5), these latter do not
count as substances. But it is not true that the parts would not exist
without the whole if one takes <em>parts</em> right down to the
natural elements and atoms that make the artefact. Then one has a
conflict about what is deemed basic between the descriptive and the
teleological criteria. It is to avoid this conflict that Aristotle
rejects atomism, by allowing that there are no true entities, only
stuffs, more basic than those he wants to treat as substances by the
criteria of teleological significance. He avoids having to face the
problem that one set of things is basic or substantial descriptively,
namely the atoms from which everything is constituted, and another set
of things &ndash; the macroscopic objects of our ordinary lives
&ndash; are substances by the criterion of teleological importance.
Because matter is stuff, not individuals, the objects that are
teleologically important are also the descriptively basic objects,
because what they are made of are not objects at all.</p>

<p>
It could be argued that atomism can be reconciled with treating the
things that are significant for us as substances only if one thinks of
the atoms as existing only in order to constitute such objects. This
would be so if God had created the atoms so as to construct
macroscopic objects from them, just as we create the parts of
artefacts only for the sake of the artefacts. It might be argued that
the same objective could be reached without theism if there is
irreducible teleology in nature that gives significance to the rest.
Thomas Nagel&rsquo;s view in his (2012) either adopts or comes close
to this position. But Nagel&rsquo;s position seems to challenge
natural science within its own realm, whereas the &ldquo;theological
artefact&rdquo; model does not. It is uncontroversial that an
artefact, such as a clock, can be both mechanical and defined as the
kind of thing that it is by its function. Applying this model to
nature as a whole would involve bringing theology into
Aristotle&rsquo;s metaphysics more directly than he, or indeed
Aquinas, intended. The notion that an object is what it is because of
its use is found in Heidegger (1927 [2008]) but this is the use to
which we put objects, not a divinely ordained teleology;
Heidegger&rsquo;s theory imports the subjective perspective implicit
in phenomenology, and this runs counter to Aristotle&rsquo;s
objectivism. If, however, one takes the teleology to be designed into
creation, this subjectivism is eliminated, and if one thinks that
teleology is the key determinant of substantial identity, as with
artefacts, then one has preserved the doctrine of substance, rather
than replacing it by a mere theory of function. This would have the
consequence that if the designer could change the purpose of an object
whilst leaving it physically unchanged &ndash; as we do if we use a
knife as a screwdriver &ndash; then its substantial identity will
change. (Schillebeeckx, 1968, Dummett, 1987, Robinson, 2016)</p>

<h2 id="Conc">4. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
All non-relativist philosophical systems acknowledge substances in the
most generic sense of that term, for that is only to acknowledge that
there are some fundamental entities in their system. Most, if not all,
philosophers acknowledge that we cannot function without using
substance concepts in the narrower sense, for the notion of an
enduring particular or individual substance is essential to our making
sense of the world as we live in it. But three things at least remain
controversial. First, it is disputed what kinds of concepts need to be
deployed to characterise these things: are they the rich variety of
traditional or &ldquo;Aristotelian&rdquo; substance concepts, or will
various ways of identifying things simply as physical bodies with
certain characteristics do the job? Second, it is still unclear how
far our substance concepts purport to reflect a component in reality
(real or imagined) over and above the bundle of properties that
constitute its intelligible aspects. Third, the unclarity of the
connection between <em>what a thing is</em> and <em>what it does</em>
leaves unresolved the degree of interdependence between substance
concepts and notions of purpose and final causation</p>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Adolf Reinach was a leading representative of so-called
&ldquo;realist&rdquo; phenomenology. So pivotal was his role in
shaping the early phases of the phenomenological movement that many
young scholars saw in Reinach their real teacher in phenomenology.
Although his life was tragically cut short at the age of 34 in 1917,
Reinach&rsquo;s production is remarkably wide and diverse in its
thematic breadth, touching on issues of relevance to general ontology,
philosophy of mind and action, philosophy of law, philosophy of
language, philosophy of physics, philosophy of religion, and other
disciplines. Lucidly clear, profoundly insightful, and precisely
argued, Reinach&rsquo;s contributions represent some of the best
results that can be achieved through the phenomenological approach to
philosophizing.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="LifeWork">1. Life and Works</h2>

<p>
Adolf Reinach was born into a prominent Jewish family in Mainz,
Germany in 1883. In 1901 he enrolled at the Ludwig Maximilian
University in Munich to study law, psychology, and philosophy. Four
years later he submitted his dissertation, which was entitled <em>On
the Concept of Causality in the Criminal Code</em>, and written under
the direction of Theodor Lipps. During this time, Reinach joined the
<em>Academic Society for Psychology</em>&mdash;a group of young
philosophers who gravitated around Lipps. This group included Johannes
Daubert, Alexander Pf&auml;nder, Theodor Conrad, Moritz Geiger, among
many others. In 1909 Reinach moved to G&ouml;ttingen, where he
completed his Habilitation on <em>Essence and Systematics of
Judgment</em> under Edmund Husserl&rsquo;s sponsorship. During his
years in G&ouml;ttingen, Reinach inspired and influenced the so-called
 <a href="../phenomenology-mg/">Munich and G&ouml;ttingen Circles of Phenomenology</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Between 1909 and 1913 Reinach published an important series of long
articles. These include: <em>On the Theory of Negative Judgment</em>
(1911), which is a condensed summary of his lost Habilitation
developing his theory of judgment and of states of affairs;
<em>Kant&rsquo;s Conception of Hume&rsquo;s Problem</em> (1911), where
an account of metaphysical necessity is presented; and
<em>Premeditation; its Ethical and Legal Significance</em> (1912/13),
which provides a description of epistemic and practical agency. In
1913 he published his masterpiece <em>The Apriori Foundations of the
Civil Law</em> (<em>Die apriorischen Grundlagen des b&uuml;rgerlichen
Rechtes</em>), which appeared in the first volume of the <em>Yearbook
for Philosophy and Phenomenological Research</em>, which Reinach had
founded and edited together with Moritz Geiger, Edmund Husserl, Max
Scheler, and Alexander Pf&auml;nder. In this monograph, Reinach offers
an account of many fundamental concepts concerning our shared social
world, including normativity, proxy agency, property, positive law,
and speech acts such as promises, orders, requests, and
enactments.</p>

<p>
After the declaration of war in 1914, Reinach enlisted in the German
army, and only some letters and philosophical sketches from the war
years have survived. Shortly after he was baptized into the
Evangelical Church, he died in battle in Flanders in 1917. His death
profoundly influenced the future history of the phenomenological
movement. Herbert Spiegelberg writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Independently of each other, the G&ouml;ttingen students of
phenomenology like Wilhelm Schapp, Dietrich von Hildebrand, Alexander
Koyr&eacute; and Edith Stein, in their accounts of this period, refer
to Reinach, not to Husserl, as their real teacher in phenomenology.
Hedwig Conrad-Martius even goes so far as to call him the
phenomenologist <em>par excellence</em>&hellip; It was his death in
action in 1917 rather than Husserl&rsquo;s going to Freiburg which cut
short not only his own promise but that of the G&ouml;ttingen
phenomenological circle. (1982: 191&ndash;192)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Karl Schuhmann and Barry Smith&rsquo;s critical edition of
Reinach&rsquo;s work includes all his publications as well as his
unpublished manuscripts. In this latter material, one can find the
text of the lecture he gave in 1914 in Marburg entitled <em>Concerning
Phenomenology</em>, which can be considered a manifesto of realist
phenomenology.</p>

<p>
Many of Reinach&rsquo;s ideas have been rediscovered by contemporary
philosophers, often without awareness of his philosophical work and
significance. Notable examples of this include his theory of social
acts, which predates similar theories developed by Austin and Searle;
the thesis that metaphysical necessity is grounded in essences; the
distinction between social and moral normativity; the idea that
acquiring knowledge is a <em>sui generis</em> act of the mind; the
description of the psychological sense of commitment; and his
recognition that there are genuinely social entities, which are
neither physical nor psychological (examples being the claim and
obligation that arise through an act of promising).</p>

<h2 id="ReinRealPhen">2. Reinach&rsquo;s Realist Phenomenology</h2>

<p>
Reinach sees himself as developing a distinctive approach to
philosophy with the goal of being faithful to what is given in
different kinds of experience (linguistic, religious, moral,
perceptual, emotional, aesthetic, and so forth). Reinach argues that
some of these experiences have the power to make their subject
acquainted with objects and their &ldquo;<em>a priori</em>&rdquo; or
&ldquo;essential structures
(<em>Wesenszusammenh&auml;nge</em>)&rdquo;. Thus, Reinach writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We can surely take it as generally granted that there are <em>no
self-evident and necessary</em> relations of essence in the causal
relations of external events. However it is, to speak with Hume, that
we come to know that fire produces smoke, this is <em>surely not
intelligibly grounded in the essence of fire</em>, as it lies in the
essence of the number 3 to be larger than the number 2. (1913a [1989:
155], English translation 2012: 15, emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As this passage illustrates, Reinach draws a fundamental distinction
between contingent and <em>a priori</em>, i.e., general and
metaphysically necessary states of affairs. Three ideas, here, shed
light on Reinach&rsquo;s understanding of phenomenology.</p>

<p>
First, <em>a priori</em> states of affairs are grounded in the very
nature, or essence, of their underlying or &ldquo;founding&rdquo;
objects (Reinach 1911b; for contemporary discussions of this idea, see
Fine 1994a, 1994b, 1995 and Mulligan 2004). For example, 3 is larger
than 2 in virtue of its essence; orange lies between red and yellow in
virtue of its essence; promises generate obligations in virtue of
their essence; and remorse presupposes the memory of a past wrongdoing
in virtue of its essence. Since each and every object, being the
object that it is, carries an essence or a nature, each and every
object is embedded in some <em>a priori</em> or essential structure.
Importantly, such structures are mind-independent states of affairs:
they are not ascribed, imposed, or projected onto the world; rather,
they are grounded in the nature of the entities themselves. This is
not, however, to say that the mind, for Reinach, does not have the
capacity to create entities, as we will see in his account of social
and institutional entities.</p>

<p>
A core aim of phenomenology is thus to accurately describe the <em>a
priori</em> states of affairs that we find in the world. Each and
every object carries an essence, but not all essences are of equal
interest to the phenomenologist, whose attention goes to those
essences which have a higher degree of intelligibility or of
philosophical significance (von Hildebrand 1976: 128&ndash;136). The
task of investigating such philosophically significant essences opens
up an almost inexhaustible domain of eidetic research for the
phenomenologist:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the realm of the <em>a priori</em> is incalculably large &hellip; [and
this] opens up for investigation an area so large and rich that still
today we cannot see its boundaries. (1914 [1989: 546], English
translation 2012: 215f)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In defending the existence of <em>a priori</em> states of affairs,
phenomenological realists thus believe that they have established a
new kind of research agenda for philosophy, illustrated in
Reinach&rsquo;s investigations into the essences of mental states
(emotions, intentions, perceptions, judgments&hellip;), the nature of
social and institutional entities (obligations, claims, rights,
property&hellip;), the nature of movement, and many more. All these
investigations should be understood as contributions to corresponding
eidetic disciplines (eidetic psychology, eidetic social ontology,
eidetic physics, and so on).</p>

<p>
Second, to invoke essences in metaphysical explanations &ldquo;does
not mean anything dark or mystical&rdquo; (1913a [1989: 144], English
translation 2012: 5). Essences are objects of a particular kind: they
are, as the next section clarifies, ideal objects. Hence, essences,
just like objects of other sorts, can&mdash;at least in
principle&mdash;be apprehended, grasped or cognized by a subject
(Reinach 1911c [1989: 104], English translation 1982: 325).
Importantly, Reinach denies that the intuition of essences requires
any special epistemological technique (as the later Husserl argued).
We can intuit essences in experiencing just a single instance: for
example, in making a promise (in realizing a specific instance of the
essence of promise), the promisor can understand that all instances of
promises, by necessity, are directed to an addressee. To put this
differently, the subject understands that, as a matter of necessity,
there can be no promise that is not directed to some promisee. In
fact, Reinach goes so far as to claim that we don&rsquo;t even need to
experience an actual instance of the essence: in some cases, an act of
imagination can make the essence known to the imagining subject. He
writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I can now, in this moment, convince myself with complete certainty of
the fact that orange lies qualitatively between red and yellow, if
only I succeed in bringing to clear intuition for myself the
corresponding natures. I need not have reference to some sense
perception, which would have to lead me to a place in the world where
a case of orange, red, and yellow could be found. Because of this, not
only&mdash;as is often pointed out&mdash;does one need to perceive
merely a single case in order to apprehend the a priori laws involved
in it; in truth, one also does not need to perceive, to
&ldquo;experience&rdquo;, the single case. One need perceive nothing
at all. Pure imagination suffices. (Reinach 1914 [1989: 543], English
translation 2012: 157; see also 1912/13 [1989: 285])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is important that Reinach not be misunderstood on this point. He is
not suggesting that the job of the phenomenologist starts and ends
with intuitions of essences. Quite the contrary: the intuition should
be proved to be veridical, the revealed essence adequately understood,
its relations with other essences described, the conditions of its
instantiation clarified.</p>

<p>
The third idea is that essences may or may not be instantiated. It is
controversial in the literature whether or not this idea commits
Reinach to Platonism (DuBois 1995; Baltzer-Jaray 2009). But it can be
argued that, if it does (see Salice 2009; B. Smith 1987), then Reinach
would not be embracing a na&iuml;ve form of Platonism. For instance,
Reinach explicitly rejects a notion of essences that would generate
any form of third man argument. In his article, <em>The Supreme Rules
of Rational Inference According to Kant</em> of 1911, he observes that
essences (what he calls there &ldquo;general concepts&rdquo;) do not
have the same properties as the objects that instantiate them. He
notes that it would be an ontological mistake to assume that essences
are the same sorts of things as the entities that have them. For
instance, the judgment that &ldquo;the triangle has three sides&rdquo;
does not convey the idea that the essence of the triangle itself
instantiates triangularity&mdash;for that would be nonsensical.
Rather, the judgment should be understood as expressing the thought
that &ldquo;everything that is a triangle has three sides&rdquo;. It
is this general and necessary state of affairs that is the specific
object of our <em>a priori</em> knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="GeneOntoObjeStatAffa">3. General Ontology: Objects and States of Affairs</h2>

<p>
By endorsing the view that the two most general categories in formal
ontology are those of object and state of affairs, Reinach refines a
number of ideas that were already circulating at his time (Husserl
1900/01; Meinong 1904, 1910).</p>

<p>
Objects (<em>Gegenst&auml;nde</em>) are either real or ideal. Real
objects are either physical or mental. So, for instance, a volcano is
a physical entity: it is an individual that is extended in both time
and space. By contrast, the perception of a volcano is a mental
entity, which is also an individual, but extended only in time. Hence,
what gives unity to the category of real objects is that all real
entities are both temporal and individual.</p>

<p>
Ideal objects are atemporal: they are unaffected by the passage of
time. An important distinction Reinach draws within this category is
between sortal and non-sortal essences (1911 [1989: 57], English
translation 1994: 87f, see also 1913b [1989: 420]). Qualities, i.e.,
non-sortal essences or characterizing properties, like redness or
sweetness, do not allow us to count things (or they do so only in
association with the count noun &ldquo;thing&rdquo;). By contrast,
sortal essences help us in counting (one whale, a second whale, a
third whale&hellip;). Objects are instances of types or essences,
while &ldquo;moments&rdquo; (individualized properties or
&ldquo;tropes&rdquo;) are instances of qualities (see Reinach 1912
[1989: 361]).</p>

<p>
The combination of an object with its moments is called by Reinach an
&ldquo;underlying situation [<em>zugrundelieger
Tatbestand</em>]&rdquo; or a &ldquo;unitary complex
[<em>Einheitskomplex</em>]&rdquo; (compare the use of the term
&ldquo;complex&rdquo; by Russell and Wittgenstein, see Potter 2008,
esp. 102&ndash;108). So, for instance, the singular term &ldquo;the
rose&rdquo; refers to an object, where &ldquo;the red rose&rdquo;
points to a complex that is constituted by the rose together with its
moment of redness. Importantly, any complex &ldquo;founds&rdquo;
states of affairs: in this example, the red rose founds the being-red
of the rose. States of affairs (<em>Sachverhalte</em>&mdash;another
term used by Wittgenstein) are categorically different from objects
and complexes, as the following considerations show (many of these
ideas are presented in Reinach 1911c [1989: 112&ndash;120], English
translation 1982: 332&ndash;346).</p>

<p>
First, states of affairs either obtain or not, whereas objects (and,
by extension, complexes) either exist or not. Reinach does not
elaborate on this point, but it stands to reason that a state of
affairs obtains if and only if its underlying complex exists. The
point is made by his close friend Theodor Conrad: &ldquo;Clearly one
can &hellip; say correctly [that states of affairs subsist] only if
the (external) situation [<em>Tatbestand</em>] really is objective
&hellip;&rdquo; (Conrad 1953&ndash;1954). For instance, the being-red of
the rose obtains if and only if the red rose exists.</p>

<p>
Second, states of affairs are either positive or negative, whereas
objects do not exhibit any analogous dichotomy. States of affairs are
negative or positive in virtue of their unique structure, which is
constituted by a predicative component: &ldquo;the being-<em>F</em> of
<em>x</em>&rdquo;. A negative state of affairs is one whose
predicative component is affected by negation: &ldquo;the
<em>not</em>-being-<em>F</em> of <em>x</em>&rdquo;. Since states of
affairs are the only entities constituted by a predicative component,
and since the negation only affects predicative components, only
states of affairs can be negative. Two consequences follow from this
idea:</p>

<ul class="jfy">

<li>Since objects do not carry a predicative component, and since
negation only affects predicative components, there are no negative
objects. Essences, qualities, or complexes are objects and hence there
are no negative essences, qualities or complexes.</li>

<li>States of affairs require an object that saturates or
&ldquo;completes [<em>erg&auml;nzt</em>]&rdquo; their predicative
component. The number of saturating objects varies depending on the
nature of the predicative component. In addition to monadic states of
affairs and polyadic states of affairs (i.e., relations), Reinach
defends the controversial claim that there are also genuinely
impersonal states of affairs (1908). So, for instance, the proposition
&ldquo;it rains&rdquo; refers to a state of affairs that, according to
Reinach, is impersonal. (We will come back to this idea in
 <a href="#ReinLega">Section 5</a>.)</li>
 </ul>

<p>
Reinach argues that the principle of non-contradiction is grounded in
these two properties of states of affairs (obtaining vs non-obtaining;
being negative vs being positive): either a positive state of affairs
obtains, or its negative contradictory does. Insofar as the principle
of non-contradiction applies to states of affairs, it is an
ontological principle and must be distinguished from the principle of
bivalence, which is a logical (not an ontological) principle asserting
that any declarative proposition is either true or false. The two
principles are, however, closely related: a proposition is true if and
only if the corresponding state of affairs obtains. To put this
differently, states of affairs are truth-makers, whereas propositions
are truth-bearers.</p>

<p>
Reinach maintains further that, just like the principle of
non-contradiction, many other principles, which are traditionally held
to be logical in nature, are in fact ontological because they hold of
states of affairs (1911c [1989: 138 fn 1], English translation 1982:
376). For instance, the theory of deduction
(<em>Schlu&szlig;lehre</em>), traditionally conceived as a branch of
logic, in fact belongs to ontology since it concerns states of
affairs. Reinach shows this by pointing out that the relation of
ground and consequent, which is fundamental to the understanding of
deduction, holds among states of affairs and must be distinguished
from causality. For instance, the being-mortal of all humans is the
ground&mdash;not the cause&mdash;of Socrates&rsquo; being mortal.
Events, by contrast, stand in relations of causality, but they never
enter relations of ground and consequent. A first billiard ball
hitting a second ball is the cause&mdash;not the ground&mdash;for the
movement of the second ball.</p>

<p>
Two other properties of states of affairs are of importance.</p>

<p>
First, states of affairs can instantiate modal properties. These
include alethic properties such as possibility and necessity. We have
already seen that a state of affairs is necessary when it is grounded
in an essence. Furthermore, states of affairs can also instantiate
deontic properties: for instance, something can be permissible or
obligatory. (We will come back to the deontic properties of states of
affairs in the next section.)</p>

<p>
Second, Reinach also suggests that states of affairs are either
atemporal (for example, the fact that 3 is bigger than 2) or temporal
(for example, the fact that the tree is blossoming). The temporality
of states of affairs has a specific nature: states of affairs are in
time, even though, in contrast to events, they do not unfold in time.
He writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
events, for example thunder, unfold themselves [<em>konstituieren
sich</em>] in time, things do not, but a thing <em>is</em> in time.
Accordingly, states of affairs do not unfold themselves in time, but
they <em>are</em> in time because they are equipped with temporal
determinations. (1910 [1989: 352])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
How do we come to know states of affairs? Reinach claims that these
entities can be given to us in perceptual acts of a specific kind.
When we report a perception by using a that-clause (&ldquo;I perceive
<em>that</em> this animal is barking&rdquo;) or a qualifier followed
by a property (&ldquo;I perceive this animal <em>as</em> a
dog&rdquo;), then we are reporting an instance of cognizing or of
coming to know something (<em>Erkennen</em>, Reinach 1911c [1989:
118], English translation 1982: 342). Given that states of affairs are
either positive or negative, it follows that, if certain psychological
preconditions are fulfilled, one can also perceive or come to know
negative states of affairs. If, e.g., I open the fridge with the
expectation of finding a can of beer unbeknownst of the fact that
somebody already drank it, then I can perceive that <em>there is no
can of beer in the fridge.</em> Importantly, this experience is not a
belief (or conviction, <em>&Uuml;berzeugung</em>) because belief is
polar (I either believe or disbelieve something). But cognizing is not
polar: either I cognize something or I do not cognize at all. Also,
beliefs endure, whereas acts of cognizing are episodic. This
difference, however, should not let us overlook the important
relations between the two experiences. In particular, acts of
cognizing can motivate beliefs, Reinach argues: the perception that
there is no beer in the fridge can motivate you to believe that there
is no beer in the fridge. And the act of rehearsing that belief in
conscious and linguistic thought by uttering the words &ldquo;there is
no beer in the fridge!&rdquo; is an act of assertion
(<em>Behauptung</em>). Because of the basic and fundamental role that
<em>sui generis</em> acts of cognizing play in making us acquainted
with states of affairs, some authors have claimed that Reinach
anticipates the so-called knowledge-first approach in epistemology
(see Mulligan 2014; on the knowledge-first approach, see Williamson
2000).</p>

<p>
Reinach&rsquo;s description of states of affairs and objects belongs
to general ontology. Yet, his contributions to ontology are not
limited to this area of research. In particular, he must be credited
for uncovering the specific ontology of social and institutional
entities (in a philosophical exercise that nowadays goes under the
label of
 &ldquo;<a href="../social-ontology/">social ontology</a>&rdquo;).
 Consider a promissory obligation (<em>Verbindlichkeit</em>), for
example the obligation to meet you at the pub at 5 p.m., which is
generated by my promising that I will meet you at the pub at 5
p.m.</p>

<p>
This obligation is discharged, which means that it ceases to exist, at
the moment I honor it by meeting you at the pub. But if it can be
discharged, this means that the obligation was there in the first
place. Hence, the obligation is an entity, which invites the question
concerning its ontological nature: do obligations fall under the
category of object or under that of state of affairs? If they were
objects, then they would be either real or ideal.</p>

<p>
If obligations were real objects, then they must be either physical or
mental. But obligations are not physical objects for they are not
extended in space (one cannot stumble upon an obligation; obligations
cannot be seen, heard, set on fire).</p>

<p>
The question then is whether obligations are mental objects. Reinach
first considers whether they are beliefs. They are not, he claims,
because having a belief about an obligation does not obligate the
believer: the belief can, for example, be about someone else&rsquo;s
obligation. Also, my belief about my obligation can be
mistaken&mdash;I have the belief, but there is no obligation. Reinach
then considers whether an obligation boils down to a subjective sense
of commitment. Interestingly, and anticipating much literature on the
matter (see Michael 2022; Tomasello 2020), he insists that feelings
like the sense of commitment (and the sense of entitlement) do indeed
exist and play a crucial role in our psychology (within phenomenology,
Stavenhagen 1931 amplifies on this topic). But such feelings do not
coincide with obligations&mdash;for feelings are warranted or not:
just as my fear of the barking dog in front of me is warranted only if
the dog is dangerous, so my feeling of commitment towards you is
warranted only if I have an obligation towards you, and this
obligation is then in addition to my feeling. In general, Reinach
contends that any hypothesis which aims at reducing obligations to
subjective experiences is doomed to misfire. To illustrate the point,
imagine accepting a car loan and agreeing to pay back the loan over a
36-month period. The very fact that an obligation (or a claim) may
last for years without change shows that it survives (and, in fact,
that it is independent of) changes in the bearer&rsquo;s psychology:
the bearer can forget the obligation, can lose consciousness, can even
die, but none of these impacts the existence of the obligation. But if
obligations are neither mental nor physical, then they are not real
objects either.</p>

<p>
This result leads to the question of whether obligations are ideal
objects. But again, the answer here is in the negative, given that
ideal objects are atemporal, whereas obligations exist in time (all
these arguments are to be found in 1913a [1989: 147&ndash;150],
English translation 2012: 8&ndash;11).</p>

<p>
Are promissory obligations states of affairs? Interestingly, Reinach
points to several similarities between the two. For instance, he tells
us that obligations stand in relations of ground and
consequent&mdash;the existence of a promise (which is a state of
affairs) is a ground (not a cause) of an obligation (Reinach 1913a
[1989: 155], English translation 2012: 15). Also, promissory
obligations appear to be relations (and, thus, polyadic states of
affairs): they hold between a promisor, a promisee, and the content of
the promise; they also are associated in every case with promissory
claims as their converse relations. Further, as we have seen, Reinach
consistently argues that obligations, like some states of affairs, are
in time (although they do not unfold in time). Nowhere, however, does
he explicitly state that promissory obligations and claims
<em>are</em> states of affairs.</p>

<h2 id="SociActsNorm">4. Social Acts and Normativity</h2>

<p>
In the <em>Logical Investigations</em>, Husserl develops a thesis
advanced by Franz Brentano, according to which intentionality, i.e.,
the property of being directed towards an object, is a crucial power
of the mind. Based on this notion of intentionality, Husserl argues
that, since language essentially serves to express intentional
experiences, all uses of language essentially are referential. So, for
example, the sentence &ldquo;this is a whale&rdquo; uttered by a
subject while they perceive a whale expresses their subjective
perception of the whale and, hence, refers to the intentional object
of the perception (which is the perceived whale). To accommodate
non-declarative sentences like promises, questions or commands in this
conceptual framework, Husserl maintains that these sentences express
beliefs about the subject&rsquo;s inner experience. For instance, my
question &ldquo;what time is it?&rdquo; expresses my belief that I
have the desire to know the time and, hence, refers to that desire
(the desire being the intentional object of my belief). Similarly, my
promise to you &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be at the pub at 5 p.m&rdquo;.
expresses my belief that I have the intention of being at the pub at 5
p.m. and, hence, refers to that intention.</p>

<p>
It was in critical reaction to such theses that Reinach developed his
theory of <em>social acts</em> (B. Smith 1990), a theory which bears
striking similarities to the theory of speech acts later developed by
Austin and Searle in the 1960s. Compare promising and reporting
one&rsquo;s intention to do something. According to Reinach, these two
experiences belong to the category of what he calls
&ldquo;spontaneous&rdquo; acts: these are acts which involve a
subject&rsquo;s bringing something about within his own psychic
sphere, as contrasted with passive experiences of, say, feeling a pain
or hearing an explosion (1913a [1989: 158], English translation 2012:
18). Yet, there is a crucial difference between these two spontaneous
acts, namely that they have different conditions of success. In
particular, the promise is successful if it generates a promissory
obligation for the promisor and a claim for the promisee. We will come
back to this point below, but for now it is important to highlight
that the report of an intention does not stand under similar criteria
of assessment. Forming an intention and reporting it are not acts that
aim at the generation of obligations and claims.</p>

<p>
Once this first point is established, one can unearth another crucial
difference between the two acts. For an act of promise to be
successful, that is, for it to generate a claim and an obligation,
this act must be registered by its addressee. For unless the promisee
has heard the act that has been directed to them, the promise will not
have the mentioned consequences. This peculiar property, which Reinach
calls &ldquo;the need of being heard
(<em>Vernehmungsbed&uuml;rftigkeit</em>)&rdquo;, is one that the
promise shares with a vast number of acts like apologizing,
commanding, accusing, answering, asking, requesting, informing. Those
acts and only those acts, which are in need of being heard, are
classified by Reinach as &ldquo;social acts&rdquo;. All social acts
hence require a linguistic utterance or some other overt performance
of a non-natural and rule-governed sort that is addressed to an
addressee. This thereby serves the fulfillment of their need of being
heard, which is a necessary condition for them to achieve their
effects.</p>

<p>
None of this applies to intentions (nor to their mere reports, as it
does not apply also to acts such as cursing, blessing, forgiving, and
so forth). This is not, however, to say that promises and intentions
are unrelated. Quite the contrary: a promise always presupposes the
intention to perform the action that has been promised. If such an
intention is not present, one issues merely a sham promise, which is
not a promise at all (as a false friend is not a friend). Reinach
speaks in this context of the &ldquo;pseudo-performance
(<em>Scheinvollzug</em>)&rdquo; of a promise (1913a [1989: 162],
English translation 2012: 22). Similar considerations apply to all
social acts: to be authentically performed, each social act
presupposes a non-social, internal state on the part of the speaker.
Thus an act of questioning presupposes uncertainty about the content
of the question (otherwise it is a rhetorical question, i.e., a
question to which the questioner already knows the answer); an act of
informing presupposes belief in the content of the information on the
part of the informer; and so on.</p>

<p>
Reinach discusses a plethora of social acts in <em>The A Priori
Foundations of the Civil Law</em>, including commanding, requesting,
warning, questioning and answering, informing, enacting, revoking,
transferring, granting, and the waiving of claims. But he devotes most
of his attention to the act of promising. His account of promise is
rich and insightful, but a few ideas merit extra consideration.</p>

<p>
The first idea is that, for Reinach, promises generate promissory
obligations in virtue of their nature. Promises bring about
obligations because of what they are: obligation-generators. Promising
is a <em>sui generis</em> phenomenon that was discovered and not
invented. This can also be seen in the contrast between promising and
those elements of a code of law which truly are constructed, for
example specific rules concerning primogeniture or the discharging of
liens. In holding this view, Reinach rejects any attempt of tracing
the nature of promises back to other allegedly more well-understood
accounts of obligation-generation, including via: useful social
practices (Hume 1739), social institutions (Searle 1969), expectation
triggers (Scanlon 1990), solicitations of trust (Friederich &amp;
Southwood 2011), and joint decisions (Gilbert 2018). Hewrites:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Strictly speaking, we are not proposing any <em>theory</em> of
promising. For we are only putting forward the simple thesis that
promising as such produces claim and obligation. One can try, and we
have in fact tried, to bring out the intelligibility of this thesis by
analysis and clarification. To try to explain it would be just like
trying to explain the proposition, 1 &times; 1 = 1. It is a fear of
what is directly given, a strange reluctance or incapacity to look the
ultimate data in the face and to recognize them as such, that has
driven unphenomenological philosophies, in this as in so many other
more fundamental problems, to untenable and ultimately to extravagant
constructions. (1913a [1989: 188], English translation 2012: 46)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In insisting on the intrinsic capacity of promises to elicit normative
consequences, Reinach by the same token also insists that promises
generate obligations and claims even when they have an immoral
content: immoral promises are promises and thus they commit the
promisor and entitle the promisee. This important idea requires two
comments for further elaboration.</p>

<p>
First, Reinach recognizes that the promissory obligation only is a
sufficient, <em>pro-tanto</em> reason for keeping the promise and that
the <em>pro-toto</em> reason results from the aggregation of various
other reasons to which the promisor is exposed. To begin with, the
promisor is subject not only to the promissory obligation generated by
the promise, but also to the moral duty to keep the promise.
Crucially, if the content of the promise is immoral, then the promisor
also stands under the moral duty of omitting the promised action.</p>

<p>
Second, in determining the factors that resolve this issue, Reinach
draws a distinction between what might be called &ldquo;social&rdquo;
normativity and &ldquo;axiological&rdquo; normativity (of which
&ldquo;moral normativity&rdquo; is subspecies alongside aesthetic and
epistemic normativity). Promises and other acts of the mind generate
social normativity (social obligations, claims, norms&hellip;).
Axiological normativity, in contrast, is grounded in values (1913a
[1989: 152f], English translation 2012: 13f). He writes on this point:
&ldquo;it is morally right that a morally valuable thing exists, and
the contradictory state of affairs is morally not right
[<em>unrecht</em>], etc.&rdquo; (Reinach 1913a [1989: 153 fn 1],
English translation 2012: 49). Importantly, the morally right state of
affairs that a morally valuable thing exists implies the <em>duty</em>
(<em>Verpflichtung</em>) to realize the morally valuable thing
(Reinach 1989i: 291ff, Eng. trans 99f). For instance, the action of
helping a friend in dire straits is valuable. It therefore is morally
right to help a friend in dire straits. But this just means that one
<em>ought</em> to help a friend in dire straits, which is a state of
affairs marked by a particular kind of deontic modality
(ought-modality). Each of these entities can motivate the moral action
to help the friend, but they do so in different ways, all of which
bear on the moral evaluation of the agent. Thus for example the agent
who acts solely on a duty (without awareness of its underlying value)
is morally less praiseworthy than the agent who is solely motivated by
feeling the value, and maybe even without explicit awareness of the
corresponding duty (see von Hildebrand 1916).</p>

<p>
Values are not valuings. The latter are psychological experiences, the
former ideal objects that can be exemplified in the world. As for all
objects, so it is at least in principle possible to grasp values. The
experience in which values are given to us is feeling: e.g., we feel
the generosity of an action, the beauty of a landscape, the cruelty of
a practice, the elegance of a movement, the vibrancy of a department,
the obscurity of a philosophical text. Feeling is not emoting,
however. For one can feel values, without emotionally responding to
the felt value. For instance, one can feel the injustice of a given
action without any indignation at the unjust action.</p>

<p>
Importantly, values stand in a hierarchical order: some values are
higher than others (1913b [1989: 485&ndash;515]). Reinach shares the
concept of a hierarchy of values with several phenomenologists,
including von Hildebrand, and particularly Scheler (for a comparison
between Reinach and Scheler, see J. Smith 2017, esp. 174&ndash;178).
Higher values ground stronger duties, lower values weaker duties. The
idea that duties have degrees of strength can now be brought to bear
on the issue of immoral promises: if a subject promises an immoral
action, are they morally compelled to keep the promise? It depends,
argues Reinach: if the duty to omit the action is stronger than the
duty to honor the promise, then the promisor ought not to act
according to their promise (1913a [1989: 186f], English translation
2012: 45).</p>

<h2 id="ReinLega">5. Reinach&rsquo;s Legacy</h2>

<p>
Reinach&rsquo;s ideas have been influential in shaping the thoughts of
many early phenomenologists. One of those who most clearly and
generously recognizes his debt towards Reinach is his close friend
Dietrich von Hildebrand, who picks up and advances many of his
insights. Most importantly, von Hildebrand develops an ontology that
has the notion of value at its very core. This notion is explored with
regard to its implications for our understanding of ethics (von
Hildebrand 1959) and aesthetics (1977&ndash;1984), the foundations of
which require values as indispensable and fundamental elements. By
expanding on Reinach&rsquo;s remarks about deliberation (1912/13), von
Hildebrand contributes to our understanding of the phenomenology of
action by distinguishing different kinds of conative experiences
(desire, willing, intention) and their role in shaping our conduct
(see his 1916; this is a project, which is pursued further by Hans
Reiner in his 1927). Von Hildebrand also elaborates on Reinach&rsquo;s
idea of social acts by claiming that some of our emotions are
in-need-of being heard. Romantic love, for example, which is only one
particular kind of love, strives to be understood by its addressee
(1930). Furthermore, he develops Reinach&rsquo;s knowledge-first
approach to epistemology in terms that are more explicit than those
used by Reinach himself: the act of coming to know something,
according to von Hildebrand, is factive insofar as it always makes its
subject acquainted with a fact (1976).</p>

<p>
Von Hildebrand follows Reinach, too, in arguing that philosophical
knowledge is first and foremost knowledge of <em>a priori</em> states
of affairs, meaning: states of affairs that are grounded in essences.
This preoccupation with the very notion of essence is characteristic
of the philosophical work of many early phenomenologists. An entire
battery of publications on this topic, all of which refer to Reinach,
were produced in the decades between the two World Wars. The most
notable are by Jean H&eacute;ring (1921), Roman Ingarden (1925),
Herbert Spiegelberg (1930), and Wilhelm P&ouml;ll (1936).</p>

<p>
All of these works aim to illuminate the meaning of the term
&ldquo;essence&rdquo;, which Reinach considered to be ambiguous
(1912). One attempt at disambiguation is based on the idea that the
&ldquo;individual essence&rdquo; of an entity (the essence that makes
an entity the individual entity that it is) should be set apart from
its &ldquo;essentiality&rdquo; (the essence that makes it an entity of
the kind it is). These two notions should then be further
distinguished from the essence in the sense of &ldquo;idea&rdquo;
(this is the essence considered as such, i.e., as a stand-alone entity
in isolation from its instances).</p>

<p>
Reinach&rsquo;s theory of states of affairs has also sparked a debate
among phenomenologists focusing on whether Reinach&rsquo;s maximally
realist position about states of affairs should be moderated in some
way to render it ontologically more parsimonious. For instance, some
have argued against the idea of negative states of affairs (Ingarden
1964&ndash;65, see: Chrudzimski 2012), others against the idea of
impersonal states of affairs (Pf&auml;nder 1921). Daubert draws a
distinction between the state of affairs as such (described along the
lines of Reinach&rsquo;s notion of unitary complex) and the various
ways in which the state of affairs can be apprehended and
conceptualized (states of affairs &ldquo;as cognized&rdquo;, &ldquo;as
questioned&rdquo;, &ldquo;as commanded&rdquo;, and so on, see
Schuhmann 1987). Maximilian Beck (1938) rejects the idea of state of
affairs as mind-independent entities altogether by claiming that these
entities merely depend on minds.</p>

<p>
Reinach&rsquo;s investigations into legal and social entities has also
influenced a number of phenomenologists. His theory of promises is at
the basis of Wilhelm Schapp&rsquo;s theory of contracts (1930) and has
been reactivated recently to account for economic exchanges (Massin
&amp; Tieffenbach 2017; Salice 2022). Social acts are also discussed
by Edith Stein in her account of the state (1925, see
Gonz&aacute;lez-Di Pierro 2016; Taieb 2020) and by Gerda Walther in
her account of social groups (1923, see Salice &amp; Uemura 2018).</p>

<p>
These are just a few specific examples of ways in which Reinach has
shaped the phenomenological movement. However, Reinach also exerted a
more general influence on the distinctive way in which early
phenomenologists used to philosophize. Exactly in accordance with
Reinach&rsquo;s understanding of phenomenology, they focus on very
specific problems in exchanges that often span decades. The discipline
of phenomenology, on Reinach&rsquo;s view, can neither be reduced to
the activity of a single individual (or &ldquo;ego&rdquo;), nor should
it be conceived on the model of a &ldquo;rigorous science&rdquo;.
Rather, it is a collaborative exercise, which follows a specific
philosophical method (De Santis 2022).</p>

<p>
Reinach concludes his Marburg talk of 1914 with these words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
To future generations it will be just as unintelligible that an
individual could devise philosophies as it is today that an individual
might devise natural science. When continuity within philosophical
work is attained, then that developmental process within world history
in which one science after another separated off from philosophy will
be realized within philosophy itself. Philosophy will become a
rigorous science, not in that it imitates other rigorous sciences, but
rather by keeping in mind that its problems require a peculiar method,
the working out of which is the task of centuries. (Reinach 1914
[1989: 550], English translation [modified] 2012: 165)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Reinach&rsquo;s historical role in forming and propelling the
phenomenological movement is still not fully appreciated. But perhaps
even more importantly, the same can be said of his systematic
insights: many of his ideas still wait to be re-activated within
contemporary debates especially in areas such as the philosophy of
mind, philosophy of action, axiology, philosophy of law, and social
ontology.</p>

This entry outlines the role of the Law of Non-Contradiction (LNC), or
Principle of Non-Contradiction (PNC), as the foremost among the first
(indemonstrable) principles of Aristotelian philosophy and its heirs,
and depicts the relation between LNC and LEM (the law of excluded
middle) in establishing the nature of contradictory and contrary
opposition. &sect;1 presents the classical treatment of LNC as an
axiom in Aristotle&rsquo;s &ldquo;First Philosophy&rdquo; and reviews
the status of contradictory and contrary opposition as schematized on
the Square of Opposition. &sect;2 explores in further detail the
possible characterizations of LNC and LEM, including the relevance of
future contingent statements in which LEM (but not LNC) is sometimes
held to fail. &sect;3 addresses the mismatch between the logical
status of contradictory negation as a propositional operator and the
diverse realizations of contradictory negation within natural
language. &sect;4 deals with several challenges to LNC within Western
philosophy, including the paradoxes, and the relation between systems
with truth-value gaps (violating LEM) and those with truth-value gluts
(violating LNC). In &sect;5, the tetralemma of Buddhist logic is
discussed within the context of gaps and gluts; it is suggested that
apparent violations of LNC in this tradition (and others) can be
attributed to either differing viewpoints of evaluation, as foreseen
by Aristotle, or to intervening modal and epistemic operators. &sect;6
focuses on the problem of &ldquo;borderline contradictions&rdquo;: the
range of acceptability judgments for apparently contradictory
sentences with vague predicates as surveyed in empirical studies, and
the theoretical implications of these studies. Finally, &sect;7
surveys the ways of contradiction and its exploitation in literature
and popular culture from Shakespeare to social media.</p>

<h2 id="LNCInde">1. LNC as Indemonstrable</h2>

<p>
The twin foundations of Aristotle&rsquo;s logic are the law of
non-contradiction (LNC) (also known as the law of contradiction, LC)
and the law of excluded middle (LEM). In <em>Metaphysics</em> Book
\(\Gamma\), LNC&mdash;&ldquo;the firmest of all
principles&rdquo;&mdash;is defined as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
For the same thing to hold good and not to hold good simultanously of
the same thing and in the same respect is impossible (given any
further specifications which might be added against the dialectical
difficulties). (Met. 1005b19&ndash;23, Kirwan translation).
</blockquote>

<p>
It will be noted that this statement of the LNC is an explicitly modal
claim about the incompatibility of opposed properties applying to the
same object (with the appropriate provisos). Since &#321;ukasiewicz
(1910), this <em>ontological</em> version of the principle has been
recognized as distinct from, and for Aristotle arguably prior to, the
<em>logical</em> formulation (&ldquo;The opinion that opposite
assertions are not simultaneously true is the firmest of
all&rdquo;&mdash;Met. 1011b13&ndash;14) and the <em>psychological</em>
formulation (&ldquo;It is impossible for anyone to believe that the
same thing is and is not, as some consider Heraclitus
said&rdquo;&mdash;Met. 1005b23&ndash;25) offered elsewhere in Book
\(\Gamma\); we return to Heraclitus below. Wedin (2004a), who argues
for the primacy of the ontological version (see also Meyer 2008, Other
Internet Resources), formalizes it as \(\neg \Diamond(\exists x)(Fx
\wedge \neg Fx)\). These three formulations of LNC differ in important
respects, in particular as to whether the law is explicitly modal in
character, whether it applies to propositions or to properties and
objects, and whether it requires the invocation of a metalinguistic
truth predicate. (See also the entry
 <a href="../aristotle-noncontradiction/">Aristotle on non-contradiction</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
For Aristotle, the status of LNC as a first, indemonstrable principle
is obvious. Those who mulishly demand a proof of LNC clearly
&ldquo;lack education&rdquo;: since &ldquo;a demonstration of
everything is impossible&rdquo;, resulting in infinite regress. At
least <em>some</em> principles must be taken as primitive
<em>axiomata</em> rather than derived from other
propositions&mdash;and what principle more merits this status than
LNC? (1006a6&ndash;12). In first philosophy, as in mathematics, an
axiom is both indemonstrable and indispensable; without LNC, Aristotle
argues, &ldquo;\(a\) is \(F\)&rdquo; and &ldquo;\(a\) is not
\(F\)&rdquo; are indistinguishable and no argumentation is possible.
While Sophists and &ldquo;even many physicists&rdquo; may claim that
it <em>is</em> possible for the same thing to be and not to be at the
same time and in the same respect, such a position self-destructs
&ldquo;if only our opponent says something&rdquo;, since as soon as he
opens his mouth to make an assertion, <em>any</em> assertion, he must
accept LNC. But what if he does <em>not</em> open his mouth? Against
such an individual &ldquo;it is ridiculous to seek an argument&rdquo;
for he is no more than a vegetable (1006a1&ndash;15). (See also Cohen
1986 and Clay 2019 for more on the indemonstrability of LNC and Coren
2018 on why Aristotle defends LNC against its contrary [&ldquo;All
contradictions are true&rdquo;] rather than its contradictory
[&ldquo;Some contradictions are true&rdquo;].)</p>

<p>
The celebrated Arab commentator Avicenna (ibn S&#299;n&#257;,
980&ndash;1037) confronts the LNC skeptic with a more severe outcome
than Aristotle&rsquo;s vegetable reduction: &ldquo;As for the
obstinate, he must be plunged into fire, since fire and non-fire are
identical. Let him be beaten, since suffering and not suffering are
the same. Let him be deprived of food and drink, since eating and
drinking are identical to abstaining&rdquo; (<em>Metaphysics</em> I.8,
53.13&ndash;15).</p>

<p>
The role of LNC as <em>the</em> basic, indemonstrable &ldquo;first
principle&rdquo; is affirmed by Leibniz, for whom LNC is taken as
interdefinable with the Law of Identity that states that everything is
identical to itself: &ldquo;Nothing should be taken as first
principles but experiences and the axiom of identity or (what is the
same thing) contradiction, which is primitive, since otherwise there
would be no difference between truth and falsehood, and all
investigation would cease at once, if to say yes or no were a matter
of indifference&rdquo; (Leibniz 1696/Langley 1916: 13&ndash;14). For
Leibniz, everybody&mdash;even &ldquo;barbarians&rdquo;&mdash;must
tacitly assume LNC as part of innate knowledge implicitly called upon
at every moment, thus demonstrating the insufficiency of Locke&rsquo;s
empiricism (ibid.,
 77).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
In accounting for the incompatibility of truth and falsity, LNC lies
at the heart of Aristotle&rsquo;s theory of opposition, governing both
contradictories and contraries. (See
 <a href="../square/">traditional square of opposition</a>.)
 Contradictory opposites (&ldquo;She is sitting&rdquo;/&ldquo;She is
not sitting&rdquo;) are mutually exhaustive as well as mutually
inconsistent; one member of the pair must be true and the other false,
assuming with Aristotle that singular statements with vacuous subjects
are always false. As it was put by the medievals, contradictory
opposites divide the true and the false between them; for Aristotle,
this is the primary form of
 opposition.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 Contrary opposites (&ldquo;He is happy&rdquo;/&ldquo;He is
sad&rdquo;) are mutually inconsistent but not necessarily exhaustive;
they may be simultaneously false, though not simultaneously true. LNC
applies to both forms of opposition in that neither contradictories
nor contraries may belong to the same object at the same time and in
the same respect (<em>Metaphysics</em> 1011b17&ndash;19). What
distinguishes the two forms of opposition is a second indemonstrable
principle, the law of excluded middle (LEM): &ldquo;Of any one
subject, one thing must be either asserted or denied&rdquo;
(<em>Metaphysics</em> 1011b24). Both laws pertain to contradictories,
as in a paired affirmation (&ldquo;\(S\) is \(P\)&rdquo;) and denial
(&ldquo;\(S\) isn&rsquo;t \(P\)&rdquo;): the negation is true whenever
the affirmation is false, and the affirmation is true when the
negation is false. Thus, a corresponding affirmation and negation
cannot both be <em>true</em>, by LNC, but neither can they both be
<em>false</em>, by LEM. But while LNC applies both to contradictory
and contrary oppositions, LEM holds only for contradictories:
&ldquo;Nothing can exist between two contradictories, but something
may exist between contraries&rdquo; (<em>Metaphysics</em> 1055b2): a
dog cannot be both black and white, but it may be neither.</p>

<p>
As Aristotle explains in the <em>Categories,</em> the opposition
between contradictories&mdash;&ldquo;statements opposed to each other
as affirmation and negation&rdquo;&mdash;is defined in two ways.
First, unlike contrariety, contradiction is restricted to statements
or propositions; terms are never related as contradictories. Second,
&ldquo;in this case, and in this case only, it is necessary for the
one to be true and the other false&rdquo; (13b2&ndash;3).</p>

<p>
Opposition between terms cannot be contradictory in nature, both
because only statements (subject-predicate combinations) can be true
or false (<em>Categories</em> 13b3&ndash;12) and because any two terms
may simultaneously fail to apply to a given
 subject.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 But two statements may be members of either a contradictory or a
contrary opposition. Such statements may be simultaneously false,
although (as with contradictories) they may not be simultaneously
true. The most striking aspect of the exposition for a modern reader
lies in Aristotle&rsquo;s selection of illustrative material. Rather
than choosing an uncontroversial example involving <em>mediate</em>
contraries, those allowing an unexcluded middle (e.g. &ldquo;This dog
is white&rdquo;/&ldquo;This dog is black&rdquo;; &ldquo;Socrates is
good&rdquo;/&ldquo;Socrates is bad&rdquo;), Aristotle offers a pair of
sentences containing <em>immediate</em> contraries, &ldquo;Socrates is
sick&rdquo;/&ldquo;Socrates is well&rdquo;. These propositions may
both be false, even though every person is either ill or well:
&ldquo;For if Socrates exists, one will be true and the other false,
but if he does not exist, both will be false; for neither
&lsquo;Socrates is sick&rsquo; nor &lsquo;Socrates is well&rsquo; will
be true, if Socrates does not exist at all&rdquo; (13b17&ndash;19).
But given a corresponding affirmation and negation, one will always be
true and the other false; the negation &ldquo;Socrates is not
sick&rdquo; is true whether the snub-nosed philosopher is healthy or
non-existent: &ldquo;for if he does not exist, &lsquo;he is
sick&rsquo; is false but &lsquo;he is not sick&rsquo; true&rdquo;
(13b26&ndash;35).</p>

<p>
Members of a canonical pair of contradictories are formally identical
except for the negative particle:</p>

<blockquote>
An affirmation is a statement affirming something of something, a
negation is a statement denying something of something&hellip;It is
clear that for every affirmation there is an opposite negation, and
for every negation there is an opposite affirmation&hellip;Let us call
an affirmation and a negation which are opposite a
<em>contradiction</em> (<em>De Interpretatione</em> 17a25&ndash;35).
</blockquote>

<p>
But this criterion, satisfied simply enough in the case of singular
expressions, must be recast in the case of quantified expressions,
both those which &ldquo;signify universally&rdquo; (&ldquo;every
cat&rdquo;, &ldquo;no cat&rdquo;) and those which do not (&ldquo;some
cat&rdquo;, &ldquo;not every cat&rdquo;).</p>

<p>
For such cases, Aristotle shifts from a formal to a semantically based
criterion of opposition (17b16&ndash;25). Members of an \(A/O\) pair
(&ldquo;Every man is white&rdquo;/&ldquo;Not every man is
white&rdquo;) or \(I/E\) pair (&ldquo;Some man is
white&rdquo;/&ldquo;No man is white&rdquo;) are contradictories
because in any state of affairs one member of each pair must be true
and the other false. Members of an \(A/E\) pair&mdash;&ldquo;Every man
is just&rdquo;/&ldquo;No man is just&rdquo;&mdash;constitute
contraries, since these cannot both be true simultaneously but can
both be false. The contradictories of these contraries (&ldquo;Not
every man is just&rdquo;/&ldquo;Some man is just&rdquo;) can be
simultaneously true with reference to the same subject
(17b23&ndash;25). This last opposition of \(I\) and \(O\) statements,
later to be dubbed <em>subcontraries</em> because they appear below
the contraries on the traditional square, is a peculiar opposition
indeed; Aristotle elsewhere (<em>Prior Analytics</em> 63b21&ndash;30)
sees \(I\) and \(O\) as &ldquo;only verbally opposed&rdquo;, given the
consistency of the \(I\) statement, e.g. &ldquo;Some Greeks are
bald&rdquo;, with the corresponding \(O\) statement, &ldquo;Some
Greeks aren&rsquo;t bald&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Not all Greeks are
bald&rdquo;, which doesn&rsquo;t necessarily amount to the same thing,
given existential import; see
 <a href="../square/">traditional square of opposition</a>).</p>
 
<p>
The same relations obtain for modal propositions, for propositions
involving binary connectives like &ldquo;and&rdquo; and
&ldquo;or&rdquo;, for quantificational adverbs, and for a range of
other operators that can be mapped onto the square in analogous ways
utilizing the same notions of contradictory and contrary opposition
and with unilateral entailment definable on duals (see Horn 1989).
Thus for example we have the modal square below, based on <em>De
Interpretatione</em> 21b10ff. and <em>Prior Analytics</em>
32a18&ndash;28, where the box and diamond symbols denote necessity and
possibility, respectively. As with universal affirmatives and
universal negatives, necessity and impossibility constitute
contraries: &ldquo;A priest must marry&rdquo; and &ldquo;A priest
can&rsquo;t marry&rdquo; can both be (and, on the Episcopalian
reading, are) false but cannot both be true. &ldquo;A priest can
marry&rdquo; and &ldquo;A priest can (if he wants) not marry&rdquo;
are subcontraries; these can be simultaneously true but not
simultaneously false. And necessity, as in &ldquo;A priest must
marry&rdquo;, unilaterally entails its possibility dual counterpart,
&ldquo;A priest may marry&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
In the twelfth century, Peter of Spain (1972: 7) offers a particularly
elegant formulation in his <em>Tractatus</em>; it will be seen that
these apply to the modal propositions in Figure 1 as well as to the
quantificational statements in the original square:</p>

<ul>

<li>The law of contradictories is such that if one contradictory is
true the other is false and vice versa, for nothing can be
simultaneously true and false.

<ul>

<li>Each contradictory is equivalent to (entails and is entailed by)
the negation of the other.</li>
</ul> </li>

<li>The law of contraries is such that if one is true the other is
false but not vice versa.

<ul>

<li>Each contrary statement entails the negation of the other but not
vice versa. [E.g. &ldquo;I am happy&rdquo; unilaterally entails
&ldquo;I am not unhappy&rdquo;; &ldquo;It is necessary that
\(\Phi\)&rdquo; unilaterally entails &ldquo;It is not impossible that
\(\Phi\)&rdquo;.]</li>
</ul> </li>

<li>The law of subcontraries is such that if one is false the other is
true but not vice versa.</li>
</ul>

<p>
By these definitions, the three central species of
opposition&mdash;contradiction, contrariety, and
subcontrariety&mdash;are mutually inconsistent.</p>

The law of excluded middle, LEM, is another of Aristotle&rsquo;s first
principles, if perhaps not <em>as</em> first a principle as LNC. Just
as Heraclitus&rsquo;s anti-LNC position, &ldquo;that everything is and
is not, seems to make everything true&rdquo;, so too
Anaxagoras&rsquo;s anti-LEM stance, &ldquo;that an intermediate exists
between two contradictories, makes everything false&rdquo;
(<em>Metaphysics</em> 1012a25&ndash;29). Of any two contradictories
\(p\) and \(\neg p\), LNC entails that at most one be true while LEM
entails that at least one be true. A logic validates LEM if \(p \vee
\neg p\) is a theorem in that logic. LEM thus imposes a constraint on
logical syntax and is distinct from the Principle of Bivalence, the
purely semantic property dictating that any given proposition is
either true or false. The latter principle is rejected in some
multivalued and supervaluationist logics that validate LEM, a point to
which we return in &sect;6 (see also
 <a href="../logic-manyvalued/">many-valued logics</a>,
 <a href="../sorites-paradox/">Sorites Paradox</a>,
 <a href="../truth-values/">truth values</a>).
 Despite the logical distinction between these two principles, in
practice they are often conflated.</p>

<p>
For Aristotle, the status of LEM and bivalence comes down to the
problem of future contingents. In a passage that has launched a
thousand treatises, Aristotle (<em>De Interpretatione</em>, Chapter 9)
addresses the difficulties posed by apparently contradictory
contingent statements about future events, e.g. (1a, b).</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt>1.</dt>
<dd>

<dl class="sentag tag15em">
<dt>a.</dt>
<dd>There will be a sea-battle tomorrow.</dd>
<dt>b.</dt>
<dd>There will not be a sea-battle tomorrow.</dd>
</dl> </dd>
</dl>

<p>
Clearly, (1a) and (1b) cannot both be true; LNC applies to future
contingents as straightforwardly as to any other pair of
contradictories. But what of LEM? Here is where the difficulties
begin, culminating in the passage with which Aristotle concludes and
(apparently) summarizes his account:</p>

<blockquote>
It is necessary for there to be or not to be a sea-battle tomorrow;
but it not necessary for a sea-battle to take place tomorrow, nor for
one not to take place&mdash;though it is necessary for one to take
place or not to take place. So, since statements are true according to
how the actual things are, it is clear that wherever these are such as
to allow of contraries as chance has it, the same necessarily holds
for the contradictories also. This happens with things that are not
always so or are not always not so. With these it is necessary for one
or the other of the contradictories to be true or false&mdash;not,
however, this one or that one, but as chance has it; or for one to be
true <em>rather</em> than the other, yet not <em>already</em> true or
false. Clearly, then it is not necessary that of every affirmation and
opposite negation one should be true and the other false. For what
holds for things that are does not hold for things that are not but
may possibly be or not be; with these it is as we have said. (<em>De
Interpretatione</em> 19a30-b4)
</blockquote>

<p>
Unfortunately, given the systematic ambiguity and textual variations
in the Greek text, the difficulty of telling when Aristotle is
speaking with his own voice or characterizing an opponent&rsquo;s
argument, and the lack of formal devices for the essential scopal
distinctions at issue, it has never been clear exactly just what has
been said here and in the chapter more generally. Some, including
Boethius and Lukasiewicz, have seen in this text an argument for
rejecting LEM for future contingent statements, which are therefore to
be assigned a non-classical value (e.g. &ldquo;Indeterminate&rdquo;)
or no truth-value at
 all.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 Their reasoning is based in part on the premise that the alternative
position seems to require the acceptance of determinism. Others,
however, read Aristotle as rejecting not simple bivalence for future
contingents but rather determinacy itself. This interpretive
tradition, endorsed by al-F&#257;r&#257;bi, Saint Thomas, and Ockham,
is crystallized in this passage from Abelard&rsquo;s
<em>Dialectica</em> (210&ndash;22) cited by Kneale and Kneale (1962:
214):</p>

<blockquote>
No proposition <em>de contingenti futuro</em> can be determinately
true or determinately false&hellip;, but this is not to say that no
such proposition can be true or false. On the contrary, any such
proposition is true if the outcome is to be true as it states, even
though this is unknown to us.
</blockquote>

<p>
Even if we accept the view that Aristotle is uncomfortable with
assigning truth (or falsity) to (1a) and (1b), their disjunction in
(2a) is clearly seen as true, and indeed as necessarily true. But the
modal operator must be taken to apply to the disjunction as a whole as
in (2b) and not to each disjunct as in (2c).</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt>2.</dt>
<dd>

<dl class="sentag tag15em">
<dt>a.</dt>
<dd>Either there will be or there will not be a sea-battle
tomorrow.</dd>
<dt>b.</dt>
<dd>\(\Box(\Phi \vee \neg \Phi)\) </dd>
<dt> c. </dt>
<dd>\(\Box\Phi \vee\Box\neg\Phi\) </dd>
</dl> </dd>
</dl>

<p>
For Aristotle, LNC is understood primarily not as the principle that
no proposition can be true simultaneously with its negation, but as a
prima facie rejection of the possibility that any predicate \(F\)
could both hold and not hold of a given subject (at the same time, and
in the same respect). A full rendering of the version of LNC appearing
at <em>Metaphysics</em> 1006b33&ndash;34&mdash;&ldquo;It is not
possible to truly say at the same time of a thing that it is a man and
that it is not a man&rdquo;&mdash;would require a representation
involving operators for modality and truth and allowing quantification
over
 times.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
 In the same way, LEM is not actually the principle that every
statement is either true or has a true negation, but the law that for
any predicate \(F\) and any entity \(x\), \( x\) either is \(F\) or
isn&rsquo;t \(F\).</p>

<p>
But these conceptualizations of LNC and LEM must be generalized, since
the principle that it is impossible for a to be \(F\) and not to be
\(F\) will not apply to statements of arbitrary complexity. We can
translate the Aristotelian language, with some loss of faithfulness,
into the standard modern propositional versions in (3) and (4)
respectively, ignoring the understood modal and temporal
modifications:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt>3.</dt>
<dd> LNC: \(\neg(\Phi \wedge \neg \Phi)\)</dd>
<dt>4. </dt>
<dd> LEM: \(\Phi \vee \neg \Phi\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Taking LNC and LEM together, we obtain the result that exactly one
proposition of the pair \(\{\Phi , \neg \Phi \}\) holds, where
\(\neg\) represents contradictory negation.</p>

<h2 id="ContNegaTermPropLogi">3. Contradictory Negation in Term and Propositional Logic</h2>

<p>
Not every natural language negation is a contradictory operator, or
even a logical operator. A statement may be rejected as false, as
unwarranted, or as inappropriate&mdash;misleading, badly pronounced,
wrongly focused, likely to induce unwanted implicatures or
presuppositions, overly or insufficiently formal in register. Only in
the first of these cases, as a toggle between truth and falsity, is it
clear that contradictory negation is involved (Horn 1989, Smiley
1993). Sainsbury (2004) takes truth-functional contradictory negation
to be a special case of a generalized <em>option negation</em> as a
deselection operator: If there are two mutually exhaustive and
exclusive options A and B, to select A is to deselect B. But the
relevant options may involve not truth, but some other aspect of
utterance form or meaning as in the standard examples of
<em>metalinguistic negation</em> (Horn 1989; see the entry on
 <a href="../negation/">negation</a>).
 In such cases, a speaker uses negation metalinguistically or
echoically to object to a previous or envisaged utterance on any
grounds whatsoever, including its phonetic or grammatical form,
register, or associated presuppositions or implicatures:
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a car, it&rsquo;s a Volkswagen&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Cancer selection is not <em>a</em> but <em>the</em> major force
in the emergence of complex animal life&rdquo;, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not
your old man, he&rsquo;s your father&rdquo;, &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t
call the POlice, we called the poLICE&rdquo;. In such cases, the
relevant target for deselection is what the right thing is to say in a
particular context, where &ldquo;truth is not sufficient for being
right, and may not even be necessary&rdquo; (Sainsbury 2004: 87). Thus
the apparent LNC violation (if it&rsquo;s a Volkswagen, it both is and
isn&rsquo;t a car) is not a real one.</p>

<p>
Given that not every apparent sentential negation is contradictory, is
every contradictory negation sentential? Within propositional logic,
contradictory negation is a self-annihilating operator: \(\neg(\neg
\Phi)\) is equivalent to \(\Phi\). This is explicitly recognized in
the proto-Fregean Stoic logic of Alexander of Aphrodisias:
&ldquo;&lsquo;Not: not: it is day&rsquo; differs from &lsquo;it is
day&rsquo; only in manner of speech&rdquo; (Mates 1953: 126). The
Stoics&rsquo; <em>apophatikon</em> directly prefigures the iterating
and self-cancelling propositional negation of Frege and Russell. As
Frege puts it (1919: 130), &ldquo;Wrapping up a thought in double
negation does not alter its truth value.&rdquo; The corresponding
linguistic principle is expressed in the grammarians&rsquo; bromide,
&ldquo;Duplex negatio affirmat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Not all systems of propositional logic accept a biconditional law of
double negation (LDN), \(\neg(\neg \Phi) \equiv \Phi\). In particular,
LDN, along with LEM, is not valid for the Intuitionists, who reject
\(\neg(\neg \Phi) \rightarrow \Phi\) while accepting its converse,
\(\Phi \rightarrow \neg(\neg \Phi)\). But the very possibility of
applying negation to a negated statement presupposes the analysis of
contradictory negation as an iterative operator (one capable of
applying to its own output), or as a function whose range is identical
to (or a subset of) its domain. Within the categorical term-based
logic of Aristotle and his Peripatetic successors, every
statement&mdash;whether singular or general&mdash;is of
subject-predicate form. Contradictory negation is not a one-place
operator taking propositions into propositions, but rather a <em>mode
of predication</em>, a way of combining subjects with predicates: a
given predicate can be either affirmed or denied of a given subject.
Unlike the <em>apophatikon</em> or propositional negation connective
introduced by the Stoics and formalized in Fregean and Russellian
logic, Aristotelian predicate denial, while toggling truth and falsity
and yielding the semantics of contradictory opposition, does not apply
to its own output and hence does not syntactically iterate. In this
respect, predicate denial both anticipates the form of negation in
Montague Grammar (see the entry on
 <a href="../montague-semantics/">Montague semantics</a>)
 and provides a more plausible representation of contradictory
negation in natural language, whether Ancient Greek or English, where
reflexes of the iterating one-place connective of the Stoics and
Fregeans (&ldquo;Not: not: the sun is shining&rdquo;) are hard to find
outside of artificial constructs like the &ldquo;it is not the
case&rdquo; construction (Horn 1989, &sect;7.2). In a given natural
language, contradictory negation may be expressed as a particle
associated with a copula or a verb, as an inflected auxiliary verb, as
a verb of negation, or as a negative suffix or prefix.</p>

<p>
In addition, there is a widespread pragmatically motivated tendency
for a formal contradictory negation to be strengthened to a semantic
or virtual contrary through such processes as litotes (&ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t like prunes&rdquo; conveying that I dislike prunes) and
so-called neg(ative) raising (&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that
\(\Phi\)&rdquo; conveying &ldquo;I think that \(\neg \Phi\)&rdquo;).
Similarly, the prefixal negation in such adjectives as
&ldquo;unhappy&rdquo; or &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; is understood as a
contrary rather than contradictory (not-Adj) of its base. These
phenomena have been much discussed by rhetoricians, logicians, and
linguists (see the entry on
 <a href="../negation/">negation</a>
 and Horn 1989: Chap. 5).</p>

<p>
In addition to predicate denial, in which a predicate \(F\) is denied
of a subject \(a\), Aristotelian logic allows for narrow-scope
<em>predicate term negation</em>, in which a negative predicate
<em>not-F</em> is affirmed of \(a\). The relations of predicate denial
and predicate term negation to a simple affirmative proposition (and
to each other) can be schematized on a generalized square of
opposition for singular (non-quantified) expressions (<em>De
Interpretatione</em> 19b19&ndash;30, <em>Prior Analytics</em> Chapter
46):</p>

<p>
If Socrates doesn&rsquo;t exist, &ldquo;Socrates is wise&rdquo;
\((A)\) and its contrary &ldquo;Socrates is not-wise&rdquo; \((E)\)
are both automatically false (since nothing&mdash;positive or
negative&mdash;can be truly affirmed of a non-existent subject), while
their respective contradictories &ldquo;Socrates is not wise&rdquo;
\((O)\) and &ldquo;Socrates is not not-wise&rdquo; \((I)\) are both
true. Similarly, for any object \(x\), either \(x\) is red or \(x\) is
not red&mdash;but \(x\) may be neither red nor not-red; if, for
instance, \(x\) is a unicorn or a prime number.</p>

<p>
While Russell (1905) echoed (without acknowledgment) Aristotle&rsquo;s
ambiguist analysis of negation as either contradictory
(&ldquo;external&rdquo;) or contrary (&ldquo;internal&rdquo;), by
virtue of the two logical forms assigned to &ldquo;The king of France
is not bald&rdquo; (see
 <a href="../descriptions/">descriptions</a>),
 such propositionalized accounts are bought at a cost of naturalness,
as singular sentences of subject-predicate grammatical form are
assigned the logical form of an existentially quantified conjunction
and as names are transmuted into predicates.</p>

<p>
The difference between denying \(P\) of \(S\) and affirming
<em>not-P</em> of \(S\) is realized in Ancient Greek as a scopal
distinction reflected in word order: <em>S P [not is] (Socrates
healthy not-is)</em> vs. <em>S [not P] is (Socrates not-healthy
is)</em>. As indicated in Figure 2, for Aristotle only sentences can
be in contradictory opposition. \(P\) and <em>not-P</em> both yield
falsity when predicated of a non-existent subject but one or the other
of the two terms is truthfully predicable of any existent subject in
the relevant domain. \(P\) and <em>not-P</em> are &ldquo;logical
contraries&rdquo; that exclude a true middle, an existent entity which
is neither \(P\) nor <em>not-P</em>. But naturally occurring cases of
prefixal adjectives, those marked by \(a(n)\)- in Greek, may involve
an unexcluded middle, as do polar contraries or antonym pairs. Modern
grammatical discourse departs from Aristotle in allowing for
contradictory terms: middle-allowing contrary adjectives
(<em>white</em>/<em>black</em>, <em>happy</em>/<em>unhappy</em>) are
distinguished from middle-excluding contradictory adjectives
(<em>transitive</em>/<em>intransitive</em>,
<em>alive</em>/<em>dead</em>).</p>

<p>
Jespersen (1917: 144) describes the logical status of negatively
prefixed adjectives in English:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The modification in sense brought about by the addition of the prefix
[<em>un-</em>] is generally that of a simple negative:
<em>unworthy</em> = &lsquo;not worthy&rsquo;, etc. The two terms [P,
unP] are thus contradictory terms. But very often the prefix produces
a &ldquo;contrary&rdquo; term&hellip;: <em>unjust</em> (and
<em>injustice</em>) generally imply the opposite of <em>just</em>
(<em>justice</em>); <em>unwise</em> means more than <em>not wise</em>
and approaches <em>foolish</em>, <em>unhappy</em> is not far from
miserable, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Like Aristotle, Jespersen predicts that the negation of true
contraries like <em>unhappy</em>, <em>unjust</em>, or <em>unwise</em>
will be semantically distinct from their positive bases. Thus, <em>not
unhappy</em> fails to reduce to <em>happy</em> by virtue of allowing
an unexcluded middle: one can be neither happy nor unhappy but just
blaah, in the same way that something can be neither black nor white
but one of the fifty-plus shades of gray. At the same time, even those
adjectives that are semantic contradictories, e.g.
<em>impossible</em>, may be coerced under negation into virtual
contraries. While technically any action or event must be either
possible or impossible, to assess something as <em>not impossible</em>
is often to portray its occurrence as a more remote possibility than
to assess it as <em>possible</em> simpliciter, as reflected in
attestations of &ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible, or at least not
impossible&rdquo;. Similar instances of virtual contrariety are
readily attested with negated verb phrases (&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t NOT
love the dog&rdquo; \(\ne\) I love the dog) or predicate nominals
(&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not NOT friends&rdquo; \(\ne\) We&rsquo;re
friends); see Horn 2017.</p>

<p>
Drawing on an epistemic theory of vagueness, Krifka (2007) argues that
prefixal negation always yields semantic contradictories. On this
view, <em>unhappy</em> is literally just &lsquo;not happy&rsquo;, with
the characteristic stronger understanding derived pragmatically. The
incomplete cancellation of the two negators in <em>not unhappy</em> is
taken to be a purely pragmatic phenomenon, conflating this case with
that of <em>not impossible</em>. But the classical theory has its
advantages. On that approach, <em>un-Adj</em> antonyms (like their
morphologically simplex classmates, <em>sad</em> or <em>bad</em>) are
lexical items that can constitute contraries vis-&agrave;-vis the
corresponding positive. By virtue of their lexical status, they are
candidates to undergo further semantic drift, unlike <em>not Adj</em>
sequences (or <em>non-Adj</em> forms), as evidenced in the semantic
and phonological opacity of <em>infamous</em> or <em>impious</em>.
Note too that many <em>un</em>- and <em>in</em>- adjectives
(<em>unkempt</em>, <em>inchoate</em>, <em>incorrigible</em>) lack
corresponding simple bases. Furthermore, the prefix <em>non-</em>
yields staunch contradictories (typically with objective and/or
technical senses) often contrasting minimally with <em>un-Adj</em> or
<em>in-Adj</em> contraries favoring gradable and evaluative
contexts:</p>

<ul>

<li><em>non-American</em> vs. <em>un-American; non-professional</em>
vs. <em>unprofessional</em></li>

<li><em>non-Christian</em> vs. <em>un-Christian; non-rational</em> vs.
<em>irrational</em></li>

<li><em>non-moral</em> vs. <em>immoral; non-realistic</em> vs.
<em>unrealistic</em></li>

<li><em>non-natural</em> vs. <em>unnatural; non-scientific</em> vs.
<em>unscientific</em></li>
</ul>

<p>
Even more problematically for a unified treatment, the treatment of
all negatively prefixed adjectives as semantic contradictories would
seem naturally to extend from <em>unhappy</em> or <em>unwise</em> to
simplex antonymic pairs like <em>happy</em>/<em>sad</em> or
<em>wise</em>/<em>foolish</em>, where the evidence for semantic
contrariety appears to be incontrovertible. While Krifka (2007: 174)
supports the analysis of e.g. <em>happy</em> and <em>unhappy</em> as
&ldquo;literally contradictories that receive their interpretations as
contraries only via pragmatic strengthening&rdquo;, Horn (2017) argues
that a traditional (neo-Aristotelian) approach invoking parallel but
distinct semantic and pragmatic strengthening processes is on sounder
empirical footing.</p>

<h2 id="GapsGlutLNCDisc">4. Gaps and Gluts: LNC and Its Discontents</h2>

<p>
In addition to the future contingent statements discussed in &sect;2,
vacuous subjects like those in (5a, b) have sometimes been taken to
yield a violation of LEM through the emergence of a truth-value
gap.</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt>5.</dt>
<dd>

<dl class="sentag tag15em">
<dt>a.</dt>
<dd>\(\{\)The present king of France/King Louis\(\}\) is bald.</dd>
<dt>b.</dt>
<dd> \(\{\)The present king of France/King Louis\(\}\) isn&rsquo;t
bald.</dd>
</dl> </dd>
</dl>

<p>
While Aristotle would see a republican France as rendering (5a) false
and (5b) automatically true, Frege (1892) and Strawson (1950) reject
the notion that either of these sentences can be used to make a true
or false assertion. Instead, both statements presuppose the existence
of a referent for the singular term; if the presupposition fails, so
does the possibility of classical truth assignment. Note, however,
that such analyses present a challenge to LEM only if (5b) is taken as
the true contradictory of (5a), an assumption not universally shared.
Russell, for example, allows for one reading of (5b) on which it is,
like (5a), false in the absence of a referent or denotatum for the
subject term; on that reading, on which the description has primary
occurrence, the two sentences are not contradictories. In this way,
Russell (1905: 485) seeks to guide the French monarch out of the
apparent trap without recourse to wigs or truth value gaps:</p>

<blockquote>
By the law of the excluded middle, either &lsquo;A is B&rsquo; or
&lsquo;A is not B&rsquo; must be true. Hence either &lsquo;the present
king of France is bald&rsquo; or &lsquo;the present king of France is
not bald&rsquo; must be true. Yet if we enumerated the things that are
bald and the things that are not bald, we should not find the king of
France on either list. Hegelians, who love a synthesis, will probably
conclude that he wears a wig.
</blockquote>

<p>
In those systems that do embrace truth value gaps (Strawson, arguably
Frege) or non-classically-valued systems (&#321;ukasiewicz, Bochvar,
Kleene), some sentences or statements are not assigned a (classical)
truth value; in Strawson&rsquo;s famous dictum, the question of the
truth value of &ldquo;The king of France is wise&rdquo;, in a world in
which France is a republic, simply fails to arise. The negative form
of such vacuous statements, e.g. &ldquo;The king of France is not
wise&rdquo;, is similarly neither true nor false. This amounts to a
rejection of LEM, as noted by Russell 1905. In addition to vacuous
singular expressions, gap-based analyses have been proposed for future
contingents (following one reading of Aristotle&rsquo;s exposition of
the sea-battle; cf. &sect;2 above) and category mistakes (e.g.
&ldquo;The number 7 likes/doesn&rsquo;t like to dance&rdquo;).</p>

<p>
While LNC has traditionally remained more sacrosanct, reflecting its
position as the primus inter pares of the indemonstrables,
transgressing this final taboo has become increasingly alluring in
recent years. The move here involves embracing not gaps but truth
value <em>gluts</em>, cases in which a given sentence and its negation
are taken to be both true, or alternatively cases in which a sentence
may be assigned more than one (classical) truth value, i.e. both True
and False. Parsons (1990) observes that the two non-classical theories
are provably logically equivalent, as gluts arise within one class of
theories precisely where gaps do in the other; others, however, have
argued that gaps (as in Intuitionist non-bivalent logics) are easier
to swallow than gluts (see papers in the Priest et al. 2004 collection
for further debate). Dialetheists reject the charge of incoherence by
noting that to accept some contradictions is not to accept them all;
in particular, they seek to defuse the threat of logical armageddon or
&ldquo;explosion&rdquo; posed by Ex Contradictione Quodlibet, the
inference in (6):</p>

<dl class="sentag tag20em">
<dt> 6. </dt>
<dd> \(\dfrac{~p,~ \neg p~}{\therefore q~~}\) </dd>
</dl>

<p>
Far from reduced to the silence of a vegetable, as Aristotle ordained,
the proponents of true contradictions, including self-avowed
dialetheists following the lead of Sylvan (n&eacute; Routley) and
Priest have been eloquent. </p>

<p>
Is the status of Aristotle&rsquo;s &ldquo;first principle&rdquo; as
obvious as he believed? Adherents of the dialetheist view that there
are true contradictories (Priest 1987, 1998, 2002; see also the
entries on
 <a href="../dialetheism/">dialetheism</a>
 and
 <a href="../logic-paraconsistent/">paraconsistent logic</a>)
 would answer firmly in the
 negative.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
 In the Western tradition, the countenancing of true contradictions is
typically&mdash;although not exclusively&mdash;motivated on the basis
of such classic logical paradoxes as &ldquo;This sentence is not
true&rdquo; and its analogues; such a statement is evidently true if
and only if it is not true. The Liar, or really the family of
Liar&rsquo;s paradoxes (see
 <a href="../liar-paradox/">Liar Paradox</a>),
 and Russell&rsquo;s paradox, its set-theoretic analogue (a set that
is not a member of itself both is and is not a member of
itself&mdash;see the entry on
 <a href="../russell-paradox/">Russell&rsquo;s Paradox</a>),
 would no longer constitute immediate threats to logical coherence in
the absence of LNC (see papers in Priest et al. for extended
discussion). If we are indeed prepared to jettison LNC, we can regard
&ldquo;This sentence is not true&rdquo; (or &ldquo;This statement is
false&rdquo;) as simultaneously true and not true without deriving the
resultant absurdity taken by Aristotle and his heirs to result from
such a contradiction. As Smiley (1993: 19) has remarked,
&ldquo;Dialetheism stands to the classical idea of negation like
special relativity to Newtonian mechanics: they agree in the familiar
areas but diverge at the margins (notably the paradoxes).&rdquo;
Others have remained unpersuaded, among them Lewis (1982: 434):
&ldquo;No truth does have and no truth could have, a true negation.
Nothing is, and nothing could be, literally both true and false. This
we know for certain, and <em>a priori, </em>an without any exception
for especially perplexing subject matters&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Related to the classic paradoxes of logic and set theory is the
Paradox of the Stone. One begins by granting the basic dilemma, as an
evident instance of LEM: either God is omnipotent or God is not
omnipotent. With omnipotence, He can do anything, and in particular He
can create a stone, call it \(s\), that is so heavy even He cannot
lift it. But then there is something He cannot do, viz. (ex hypothesi)
lift \(s\). But this is a violation of LNC: God can lift \(s\) and God
cannot lift \(s\). This paradox, and the potential challenge it offers
to either LNC or the possibility of omnipotence, has been recognized
since Aquinas, who opted for retaining the Aristotelian law by
understanding omnipotence as the capacity to do only what is not
logically impossible. (Others, including Augustine and Maimonides,
have noted that in any case God is &ldquo;unable&rdquo; to do what is
inconsistent with His nature, e.g. commit sin.) For Descartes, on the
other hand, an omnipotent God is by definition capable of <em>any</em>
task, even those yielding contradictions. Mavrodes (1963), Kenny, and
others have sided with St. Thomas in taking omnipotence to extend only
to those powers it is possible to possess; Frankfurt (1964), on the
other hand, essentially adopts the Cartesian line: Yes, of course God
can indeed construct a stone such that He cannot lift it&mdash;and
what&rsquo;s more, He can lift it! (See also Savage 1967 for a related
solution.)</p>

<p>
As we have seen, the target of Aristotle&rsquo;s psychological
(doxastic) version of LNC was Heraclitus: &ldquo;It is impossible for
anyone to believe that the same thing is and is not, as some consider
Heraclitus said&mdash;for it is not necessary that the things one says
one also believes&rdquo; (Met. 1005b23&ndash;26). But as Aristotle
acknowledges here (even if he is less politic elsewhere), there is
considerable uncertainty over exactly what Heraclitus said and what he
believed. Heraclitus could not have literally rejected LNC, as he is
often accused of (or praised for) doing, as his writings preceded the
statement of that principle in <em>Metaphysics</em> \(\Gamma\) by well
over a century. But the question remains: do his words, as represented
in the extant fragments, anticipate the Dialetheists and other
rejectionists? Yes and no. To be sure, Heraclitus was proud to wear
the mantle of &ldquo;paradoxographer&rdquo; (Barnes 1982: 80) and
enjoyed nothing more than to <em>&eacute;pater les bourgeois</em> of
his day. But the key fragments supporting his proclamation of the
Unity of Opposites can be taken in more than one way. He points out
that sea water is salutary (if you&rsquo;re a fish) and unhealthy (if
you&rsquo;re a human), just as garbage is preferable to gold (for a
donkey) but then again it isn&rsquo;t (for a person). And given the
inevitability of flux (as Heraclitus memorably illustrated by his
river into which one cannot step twice), what is true (today) is also
false (tomorrow). But these astute observations do not so much refute
the LNC as much as demonstrate (through what Barnes calls the Fallacy
of the Dropped Qualification) the need for Aristotle&rsquo;s crucial
codicil: sea water, for example, cannot be both healthful and
unhealthful for the same experiencer at the same time and in the same
respect. (In a similar way, &ldquo;It is raining&rdquo; may of course
be deemed true at this moment in Seattle and false in Palo Alto; we
need admit no contradiction here, whether we deal with the issue by
endorsing unarticulated constituents or in some other manner; cf.
Recanati 2002 inter alia.) Ultimately, whether one follows Kirk
(Heraclitus [1954]) in charging Aristotle with misrepresenting
Heraclitus as an LNC-denier or sides with Barnes (1982) and Wedin
(2004b) in sustaining Aristotle&rsquo;s accusation, it is hard to see
in what respect the evidence presented by Heraclitus, however subtle a
guide he may be for our travels on that path on which up and down is
one and the same, threatens the viability of LNC. (See also
 <a href="../heraclitus/">Heraclitus</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
Within the modern philosophical canon, Hegel has often been seen as
the echt LNC-skeptic, well before his reputed deathbed lament,
&ldquo;Only one man ever understood me, and he didn&rsquo;t understand
me.&rdquo; Hegel saw himself as picking up where Heraclitus left
off&mdash;&ldquo;There is no proposition of Heraclitus which I have
not adopted in my logic&rdquo; (Barnes 1982: 57)&mdash;and indeed the
Heraclitean view of a world shaped by the unity of opposites through
strife and resolution does seem to foreshadow Hegelian dialectic. In
fact, however, an unresolved contradiction was a sign of error for
Hegel. The contradiction between thesis and antithesis results in the
dialectical resolution or superseding of the contradiction between
opposites as a higher-level synthesis through the process of
<em>Aufhebung</em> (from <em>aufheben,</em> a verb simultaneously
interpretable as &lsquo;preserve, cancel, lift up&rsquo;). Rather than
repudiating LNC, Hegel&rsquo;s dialectic rests upon it. In Marxist
theory, too, contradictories do not simply cancel out but are
dynamically resolved (<em>aufgehoben</em>) at a higher level in a way
that both preserves and supersedes the contradiction, motivating the
historical dialectic. (See Horn 1989: &sect;1.3.2.)</p>

<p>
For Freud, there is a realm in which LNC is not so much superseded but
dissolved. On the primary, infantile level, reflected in dreams and
neuroses, there is no <em>not</em>: &ldquo;&lsquo;No&rsquo; seems not
to exist as far as dreams are concerned. Anything in a dream can mean
its contrary&rdquo; (Freud 1910: 155). When the analysand insists of a
dream character &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my mother&rdquo;, the analyst
knowingly translates, &ldquo;So it <em>is</em> his mother!&rdquo;
Freud sought to ground this pre-logical, LNC-free (and negation-free)
realm not just in the primal realm of the dreamer&rsquo;s unconscious
but also in the phenomenon of <em>Gegensinn</em>, words (especially
<em>Urw&ouml;rte</em>, primal words) with two opposed meanings
purported attested widely in ancient and modern languages. The
empirical basis for this latter claim, however, has been widely
discredited; see Benveniste 1956.</p>

<p>
Given Aristotle&rsquo;s observation (<em>Metaphysics</em> 1006a2) that
&ldquo;even some physicists&rdquo; deny LNC and affirm that it is
indeed possible for the same thing to be and not to be at the same
time and in the same respect, he might not have been surprised to
learn that quantum mechanics has brought such challenges once more
into play. Thus, we have Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s celebrated imaginary
cat, placed (within the context of a thought experiment) inside a
sealed box along with radioactive material and a vial of poison gas
that will be released if and only if that material decays. Given
quantum uncertainty, an atom potentially inhabits both
states&mdash;decayed and non-&mdash;simultaneously, seeming to render
the cat (in the absence of an observer outside the system) both alive
and dead. But most physicists would argue that while quantum mechanics
may challenge some aspects of classical logic it does not threaten
LNC. If we could in fact observe a cat, or a particle, as A and not-A
at the same time, then there would be a violation of the Law of
Non-Contradiction; the mere potential for an entity to be in either of
two mutually inconsistent states does not in itself violate the LNC.
</p>

<p>
As we have seen, Aristotle himself anticipated many of the challenges
that have since been raised against LNC. One more such challenge is
posed by the ubiquity of doxastic inconsistency. Take the desires of
Oedipus, for example. In seeking Jocasta as his mate, did he wish to
marry his mother? Certainly he did on the de re reading:
Oedipus&rsquo;s mother (Jocasta) is such that he wanted to marry her,
although he would not have assented to the claim that he wanted to
marry his mother. In a sense, then, &ldquo;Oedipus wanted to marry his
mother&rdquo; is true (de re) and false (de dicto), but no violation
of LNC is incurred, since these represent different propositions, the
semantic distinction neutralized within the sentential form. But what
of the de dicto reading itself: it is <em>really</em> false? After
all, as a young boy Oedipus can be assumed (by some) to have exhibited
the eponymous complex, according to which the falsity of the (de
dicto) proposition that he wanted to marry his mother on a
<em>conscious</em> level belies the truth of this proposition on an
<em>unconscious</em> level. But this does not entail that he both
wished and did not wish to &ldquo;marry&rdquo; his mother at the same
time <em>and in the same respect</em>. Whether it concerns the
unacknowledged incestuous conflict of the Theban king, the indecision
of Zerlina&rsquo;s &ldquo;Vorrei e non vorrei&rdquo; response to Don
Giovanni&rsquo;s invitation, or the unspecified ambivalence of the
respondent in Strawson&rsquo;s exchange (1952: 7)</p>

<blockquote>
&mdash;Were you pleased?
<br />
&mdash;Well, I was and I wasn&rsquo;t.
</blockquote>

<p>
we have ample opportunity to reflect on the foresight of
Aristotle&rsquo;s rider: &ldquo;a is \(F\)&rdquo; and &ldquo;a is not
\(F\)&rdquo; cannot both hold <em>in the same sense, at the same time,
and in the same respect</em>.</p>

<h2 id="LNCBuddTetr">5. LNC and the Buddhist Tetralemma</h2>

<p>
Beyond the Western canon, the brunt of the battle over LNC has been
largely borne by the Buddhists, particularly in the exposition by
N&#257;g&#257;rjuna of the <em>catu&#7779;ko&#7789;i</em> or
tetralemma (c. 200 A.D.; cf. Bochenski 1961: Part VI, Raju 1954,
Garfield 1995, Tillemans 1999, Garfield &amp; Priest 2002), also known
as the four-cornered or fourfold negation. Consider the following four
possible truth outcomes for any statement and its (apparent)
contradictory:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag20em">
<dt>7.</dt>
<dd>

<dl class="sentag tag15em">
<dt>i.</dt>
<dd>\(S\) is \(P\)</dd>
<dt>ii.</dt>
<dd>\(S\) is not \(P\)</dd>
<dt> iii. </dt>
<dd> \(S\) is both \(P\) and not-\(P\) </dd>
<dt> iv.</dt>
<dd> \(S\) is neither \(P\) nor not-\(P\) </dd>
</dl> </dd>
</dl>

<p>
For instances of the positive tetralemma, on
N&#257;g&#257;rjuna&rsquo;s account, all four statement types can or
must be accepted:</p>

<blockquote>
Everything is real and not real.
<br />
Both real and not real.
<br />
Neither real nor not real.
<br />
That is Lord Buddha&rsquo;s teaching.
<br />
&mdash;<em>M&#363;la-madhyamaka-k&#257;rik&#257;</em> 18:8, quoted in
Garfield (1995: 102)
</blockquote>

<p>
Such cases arise only when we are beyond the realm to which ordinary
logic applies, when &ldquo;the sphere of thought has ceased.&rdquo; On
the other hand, more use is made of the negative tetralemma, in which
all four of the statements in (7) can or must be rejected, and thus
one cannot assert either \(\Phi , \neg \Phi\), both \(\Phi\) and
\(\neg \Phi\), or neither \(\Phi\) nor \(\neg \Phi\). Is this
tantamount, as it appears, to the renunciation of LEM and LNC, the
countenancing of both gaps and gluts, and thus&mdash;in
Aristotle&rsquo;s view&mdash;the overthrow of all bounds of rational
argument?</p>

<p>
It should first be noted that the axiomatic status of LNC and LEM is
as well-established within the logical traditions of India as it is
for the Greeks and their
 epigones.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 Garfield (1995) and Tillemans (1999) convincingly refute the claim
that N&#257;g&#257;rjuna was simply an
 &ldquo;irrationalist&rdquo;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup>
 In the first place, if N&#257;g&#257;rjuna simply rejected LNC, there
would be no possibility of <em>reductio</em> arguments, which hinge on
the establishment of untenable contradictions, yet such arguments are
standardly employed in his logic. In fact, he explicitly prohibits
<em>virodha</em> (contradiction). Crucially, it is only in the realm
of the Absolute or Transcendent, where we are contemplating the nature
of the ultimate, that contradictions are embraced; in the realm of
ordinary reality, LNC operates and classical logic holds. (Recall
Freud&rsquo;s dichotomy between the LNC-observant conscious mind and
the LNC-free unconscious.) In this sense, the logic of
N&#257;g&#257;rjuna and of the Buddhist tradition more generally can
be seen not as inconsistent but paraconsistent. Indeed, just as
Aristotle ridiculed LNC-skeptical sophists as no better than
vegetables (see &sect;1), the Buddhists dismissed the arch-skeptic
Sanjaya and his followers, who refused to commit themselves to a
definite position on any issue, as &ldquo;eel-wrigglers&rdquo;
<em>(amar&#257;vikkhepa)</em>. Sanjaya himself was notorious for his
periodic lapses into the extended silence Aristotle described as the
last refuge of the LNC-skeptic (see Raju 1954).</p>

<p>
One aspect of the apparent paradox is precisely parallel to that
arising with some of the potential counterexamples to the LNC arising
in Western thought. In various Buddhist and Jainist systems of
thought, the apparent endorsement of \(Fa \amp \neg Fa\) (or, in
propositional terms, \(\Phi \wedge \neg \Phi)\) is upon closer
examination qualified in precisely the way foreseen by the codicils in
Aristotle&rsquo;s statement of the law: From a certain viewpoint,
\(\Phi\) (e.g. Nirvana exists); from a certain viewpoint, \(\neg
\Phi\) (e.g. Nirvana does not exist). (Compare the observation of
Jainists two millennia ago that &ldquo;\(S\) is \(P\)&rdquo; and
&ldquo;\(S\) is not \(P\)&rdquo; can both be true from different
standpoints; cf. Raju 1954: 698&ndash;701; Balcerowicz 2003. Rahlwes
2022 offers another look at the <em>catu&#7779;ko&#7789;i</em> and
Rahlwes 2023 provides a detailed analysis of the Jainists&rsquo;
<em>saptabhang&#299; </em>or seven-valued logic based on
distinguishing the dimension of truth/falsity from that of
(in)expressibility or (un)assertibility, leveraged as a way to
dissolve contradictions\(.)\)</p>

<p>
To further explore the status of truth-value gluts, in which both
classical values are simultaneously assigned to a given proposition
(e.g. &ldquo;\(x\) is real&rdquo;), let us consider the analogous
cases involving gaps. Recall, for example, the case of future
contingents as in (1a, b) above: we need not maintain that
&ldquo;Machines will surpass human-level cognition&rdquo; is neither
true nor false when uttered today, but only that neither this
statement nor its contradictory &ldquo;&ldquo;Machines will not
surpass human-level cognition&rdquo;&rdquo; is <em>assertible</em>
today in the absence of foreknowledge. Similarly for past unknowables,
such as (to adapt an example from Quine) the proposition that the
number of blades of grass on the Old Campus lawn during the 2005 Yale
commencement exercises was odd. This is again more plausibly viewed as
unassertable than as truth-valueless, even though its truth-value will
never be known. To take a third example, we can argue, with Grice
(1989: 80ff.), that a negation outside the scope of a conditional is
generally intended as a refusal (or hesitation) to assert &ldquo;if
\(p\) then \(q\)&rdquo; rather than as the contradictory negation of a
conditional, whose truth value is determined in accord with the
standard material equivalence:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag20em">
<dt> 8.</dt>
<dd> \(\neg(p\rightarrow q) \equiv(p \amp \neg q)\) </dd>
</dl>

<p>
Thus, in denying your conditional &ldquo;If you give her penicillin,
she will get better&rdquo;, I am allowing for the possibility that
giving her penicillin might have no effect on her, but I am not
predicting that you will administer the penicillin and she will fail
to recover. Nor does denying the apothegm (typically though
inaccurately attributed to Dostoyevsky or Nietzsche) that if God is
dead everything is permitted commit one to the conjoined proposition
that God is dead and something is forbidden. As Dummett (1973:
328&ndash;30) puts the point, we must distinguish negation outside the
scope of a Fregean assertion operator, not \((\vdash p)\), from the
assertion of a negative proposition, \(\vdash\)(not \(p)\). The former
interpretation &ldquo;might be taken to be a means of expressing an
unwillingness to assert&rdquo; \(p\), in particular when \(p\) is a
conditional:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag20em">
<dt> 9. </dt>
<dd>\(X\): If it rains, the match will be canceled.
<br />
\(Y\): That&rsquo;s not so. (<em>or,</em> I don&rsquo;t think
that&rsquo;s the case.) </dd>
</dl>

<p>
\(Y\)&rsquo;s contribution here does not constitute a negation of
\(X\)&rsquo;s content; rather, we can paraphrase \(Y\) as conveying
\((9'\)a) or \((9'\)b):</p>

<dl class="sentag tag20em">
<dt> 9&prime;.</dt>
<dd>

<dl class="sentag tag15em">
<dt> a.</dt>
<dd> If it rains, the match won&rsquo;t necessarily be canceled.</dd>
<dt> b. </dt>
<dd> It may [<em>epistemic</em>] happen that it rains and yet the
match is not canceled. </dd>
</dl> </dd>
</dl>

<p>
Dummett observes, &ldquo;We have no negation of the conditional of
natural language, that is, no negation of its sense: we have only a
form for expressing refusal to assent to its assertion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Similarly with disjunction. Consider the exchange in (10) preceding
the 2000 election, updated from an example of Grice:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag20em">
<dt> 10.</dt>
<dd> \(X\): Bush or Gore will be elected.
<br />
\(Y\): That&rsquo;s not so: Bush or Gore or Nader will be elected.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
\(Y\)&rsquo;s rejoinder cannot be a contradictory of the content of
\(X\)&rsquo;s claim, since the (de jure) election of Bush rendered
both \(X\)&rsquo;s and \(Y\)&rsquo;s statements true. Rather, \(Y\)
objects on the grounds that \(X\) is not in an epistemic position to
assert the binary disjunction.</p>

<p>
Unassertability can be read as the key to the apparent paradox of the
<em>catu&#7779;ko&#7789;i</em> as well. The venerable text in
<em>Majjhima-nik&#257;ya</em> 72, relating the teachings of the
historical Buddha, offers a precursor for N&#257;g&#257;rjuna&rsquo;s
doctrine of the negative tetralemma. Gotama is responding to a
monk&rsquo;s question concerning the doctrine of rebirth (quoted in
Robinson 1967: 54):</p>

<blockquote>
Gotama, where is the monk reborn whose mind is thus freed?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vaccha, it is not true to say that he is reborn.
<br />
Then, Gotama, he is not reborn.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vaccha, it is not true to say that he is not reborn.
<br />
Then, Gotama, he is both reborn and not reborn.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vaccha, it is not true to say that he is both reborn
and not reborn.
<br />
Then, Gotama, he is neither reborn nor not reborn.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vaccha, it is not true to say that he is neither
reborn nor not reborn.
</blockquote>

<p>
Note the form of the translation here, or similarly that of the
standard rendering of the negative <em>catu&#7779;ko&#7789;i</em> that
&ldquo;it profits not&rdquo; to assert \(\Phi\), to assert \(\neg
\Phi\), to assert both \(\Phi\) and \(\neg \Phi\), or to assert
neither \(\Phi\) nor \(\neg \Phi\): the relevant negation can be taken
to operate over an implicit modal, in particular an epistemic or
assertability operator. If so, neither LEM nor LNC is directly at
stake in the tetralemma: you can have your Aristotle and Buddha
too.</p>

<p>
We tend to recalibrate apparent violations of LNC as conforming to a
version of the law that incorporates the Aristotelian qualifications:
a sincere defense of &ldquo;\(p\) and not-\(p\)&rdquo; plausibly
involves a change in the context of evaluation or a shift in
viewpoint, or alternatively a suppression of modal or epistemic
operators. This practice can be seen as an instance of a general
methodological principle associated with
 <a href="../davidson/">Davidson</a>
 and Quine that has come to be called the <em>principle of
charity</em> (or, alternately, the <em>principle of rational
accommodation</em>): when it is unclear how to interpret
another&rsquo;s argument, interpret it in a way that makes the most
sense. At the same time, this procedure evokes the standard Gricean
mode of explanation (Grice 1989; see the entry on
 <a href="../implicature/"> implicature</a>):
 granted the operation of the Cooperative Principle and, more broadly,
the shared premise of rationality, we reinterpret apparent violations
of valid principles or maxims so as to conserve the assumption that
one&rsquo;s interlocutor is a rational and cooperative agent. And as
Aristotle would remind us, no principle is more worthy of conservation
than the Law of Non-Contradiction.</p>

<h2 id="VaguBordCont">6. Vagueness and borderline contradictions</h2>

<p>
We have seen that two of the more significant threats to the
unchallengeable status of LNC tend to dissolve under closer scrutiny.
Heraclitus-type contradictions <em>(Sea water is healthy and sea water
is not healthy)</em> are rendered LNC-compatible by the Aristotelian
rider designed for that purpose (&ldquo;a is \(F\)&rdquo; and &ldquo;a
is not \(F\)&rdquo; cannot both hold <em>in the same sense, at the
same time, and in the same respect</em>) once the &ldquo;dropped
qualification&rdquo; or contextual specification is restored
(&sect;4). Buddhist-type contradictions <em>(Nirvana exists and
Nirvana does not exist)</em> can be understood as modalized, embedded
under an epistemic modal or assertability operator.</p>

<p>
We are left with two significant challenges for LNC: (i) the case of
the Liar and related paradoxes of self-reference as touched on in
&sect;3 and work cited therein (see the entries on Liar Paradox,
Russell&rsquo;s Paradox, Dialetheism, Paraconsistent Logic) and (ii)
the case of vagueness and its implications for borderline truth,
discussed in this section. As we have seen, the admission of
truth-value gaps (exceptions to LEM) is mirrored by the admission of
truth-value gluts (exceptions to LNC). As intellectual heirs of the
Hegelian tradition, Marxists have willing to accept paradox, and
indeed the pre-Revolutionary theorist Plekanov (1909) suggests that
Sorites (in the form of the bald man; see sorites entry) can be
resolved by rejecting LNC. Hyde (1997) traces the history of
vagueness-based arguments for paraconsistency from Plekhanov through
Ja&#347;kowski, McGill, and Parry in the 1940s to the dialetheist
logics of today. Pointing out the parallels between treatments of
vagueness via truth-value gap theories (including the supervaluation
theory of van Fraassen 1969) and their truth-value glut counterparts,
Hyde laments the unwarranted neglect of the latter option: &ldquo;The
thought that an adequate response might require the recognition of
cases of overdetermination and and truth-value gluts has few
supporters&rdquo; (Hyde 1997: 641). In the two decades since the
publication of his important paper, that neglect has been largely
rectified, especially with the accretion of empirical support for
glut-oriented approaches endorsing the acceptability of a range of
true contradictions of the form <em>a is P and a is not P,</em> in
particular when P is a vague predicate like <em>tall</em>,
<em>vague</em>, or <em>red</em>.</p>

<p>
Supervaluation theory utilizes the concept of admissible sharpening or
precisification of vague predication (see the entry on
 <a href="../vagueness/"> vagueness</a>).
 I may be unable to assert truthfully of a given color chip in the
red-orange range that it is red, while also being unable to assert
that it is not red. Once the notion of red is sharpened or precisified
to a particular interval of wave-lengths, I am in a position to assert
either the positive proposition &ldquo;a is red&rdquo; or its negation
&ldquo;a is not red&rdquo;, but which one depends on the details of
the sharpening. A sentence \(S\) is supertrue iff it is true on every
sharpening and superfalse if it is false on every sharpening; if is
true on some sharpenings and false on others, it is neither supertrue
nor superfalse, thus corresponding to a truth-value gap. One salutary
result of this approach is that LEM can be retained: <em>P or not
P</em> is supertrue since it is true on every sharpening. Hyde (1997)
draws on the dual status of gaps and gluts to define a paraconsistent
&ldquo;subvaluation&rdquo; theory: \(S\) is subtrue iff is true on at
least one sharpening, subfalse iff it is false on at least one
sharpening, and neither subtrue nor subfalse if it is true on some
sharpenings and false on others. Given the status of supervaluation
and subvaluation as duals, each is equally defensible and applicable
to the semantics of vagueness. Crucially, it is the notion of
supertruth, or subtruth as the case may be, that tracks our natural
language intuitions of truth, and similarly for falsity. In this
sense, the logic of supervaluation is paracomplete (allowing for
violations of LEM) and the logic of subvaluation paraconsistent
(allowing for violations of LNC). In the tradition of paraconsistent
logics, Hyde stresses the need for &ldquo;quarantining the
gluts&rdquo; to avoid the explosive consequences of <em>ex
contradictione quodlibet</em> (see &sect;4).</p>

<p>
Where supervaluation theory allows <em>a is not tall</em> or <em>a is
not bald</em> to be neither (super)true nor (super)false if \(a\)
represents a borderline instance of tallness, subvaluation theory
would characterize such an assessment as both (sub)true and
(sub)false. But since tautologies are preserved if validity is defined
in terms of truth and not subtruth (or supertruth)&mdash;an assumption
that some might challenge&mdash;<em>a is tall and a is not tall</em>
can never be true, even when <em>a is tall</em> and <em>a is not
tall</em> are both true:</p>

<blockquote>
A vague sentence &lsquo;\(A\)&rsquo; and its negation might both be
true (since they each have some true disambiguation&mdash;i.e. the
sentence &lsquo;\(A\)&rsquo; itself as some true and some false
disambiguation&mdash;but their conjunction can never be. &lsquo;\(A
\amp\neg A\)&rsquo; has only false disambiguations; LNC is retained.
(Hyde 1997: 654)
</blockquote>

<p>
For Akiba (1999), however, paraconsistent subvaluation theories, like
paracomplete supervaluation theories, should be recast in a modal
light, by supplying an epistemic possibility operator <em>Pos</em> in
the former case (reminiscent of the modalized accounts of the
tetralemma explored in &sect;5) and its dual, an abstract modal
concept Akiba defines as \(\textit{Def}\) (corresponding to necessary
truth) in the latter. Thus, while \(P \amp \neg P\)
remainsafull-fledged contradiction, its
modalizedcounterpart\(\textit{Pos}(P) \amp \textit{Pos}(\neg P)\) is
coherent, and while \(P\vee \neg P\) is a valid instance of LEM,
\(\textit{Def}(P) \vee\textit{Def}(\neg P)\) is not: &ldquo;Super- and
subvaluation systems can be considered not really alternatives to
classical logic but in fact just modal extensions of it.&rdquo;
Akiba&rsquo;s key departure from Hyde&rsquo;s approach is in rejecting
the move to identify truth <em>simpliciter</em> with subtruth (or
supertruth).</p>

<p>
Confronted with the task of applying semantically vague predicates
like <em>tall</em> and <em>red</em> to borderline cases, the
intuitions of respondents in psycholinguistic studies often tend to
become uncertain. Subjects produce varying responses for the crucial
data, and the framers of the studies have produced varying
explanations for the data. In one of the earlier studies, Bonini et
al. point to the asymmetries in judgments of truth and falsity for
borderline cases of <em>a is red/tall</em> and ultimately reject
truth-gap and truth-glut accounts in favor of an LEM- and
LNC-compatible epistemic theory of &ldquo;vagueness as
ignorance&rdquo;. That is, the subject \(S\) &ldquo;mentally
represents vague predicates in the same way as other predicates with
sharp true/false boundaries of whose location \(S\) is
uncertain&rdquo; (Bonini et al. 1999: 387).</p>

<p>
Kyburg (2000) offers a pragmatic explanation for why <em>a is
tall</em> might be judged neither true nor false in a case of
borderline tallness, or why <em>a is tall and a is not tall</em> might
be judged true in the same circumstance. Without conceding gaps or
gluts, she points to a disconnect between truth-value intuitions and
assertability intuitions for a cooperative speaker aiming to be
maximally informative. Of course, in some cases, the felicity of <em>a
is tall and a isn&rsquo;t tall</em> might simply reflect the awareness
that different cut-off points apply depending on the relevant
comparative class of entities (children vs. adults, male adults vs.
male professional basketball players, etc.)&mdash;the instances
foreseen by the Aristotelian rider. But in other cases, such a
statement would indeed convey that a possesses a borderline degree of
tallness, while simply affirming or denying the vague
predicate&mdash;<em>a is tall</em> or <em>a is not
tall&mdash;</em>would communicate too high or too low a degree. Just
as speakers might refrain from uttering a sentence, or classifying as
true, a perfectly and &ldquo;sharply&rdquo; true sentence whose use
would mislead the hearer&mdash;<em>Snow is white or snow is
purple&mdash;</em>so too the assertion of a conjunction of opposites
in borderline cases&mdash;<em>a is tall and he&rsquo;s not
tall&mdash;</em>might be preferred, despite its contradictory nature,
to the misleading assertion of either <em>a is tall or a is not
tall</em> in the same circumstance.</p>

<p>
For Sorensen (2001), an individual&rsquo;s acceptance of the truth of
certain false claims, including those necessarily false claims of the
form <em>a is tall and a is not tall,</em> reflect not the inadequacy
of our semantic and logical analyses but the tendency for speakers to
be wrong, confused, or ignorant about the truth conditions of given
sentences or about their own beliefs, especially those involving
vagueness, similarly to the way in which perceptions can mislead in
the case of visual illusions.</p>

<p>
The vagueness-as-ignorance theory of Bonini et al. (1999), the modal
theory of Akiba (1999), the assertability theory of Kyburg (2000), and
the error theory of Sorensen (2001) are all semantically classical in
their preservation of LNC (along with LEM and bivalence). In essence,
each of these approaches to the assessment of vague predications
reflects a wariness about jettisoning the classical account of truth
and contradiction in favor of an approach endorsing either
supervaluations (and gaps) or subvaluations (and gluts). Despite the
difficulties posed by vagueness, these theorists would thus adopt the
philosophical corollary to the familiar legal adage: &ldquo;Hard cases
make bad laws.&rdquo; One particularly significant hard case is that
of the culturally problematic binaries of gender and race whose
rejection can take the form of two contradictories or two contraries
that are singly denied but jointly affirmed, as when a character on
the Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy TV medical drama (S15E24, 2019) declares
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a woman. I&rsquo;m not a man. I&rsquo;m
both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
In two recent papers the reconciliatory approach is rejected in favor
of defenses of paraconsistency, although not precisely along the lines
laid out by Hyde. On Hyde&rsquo;s account, <em>a is tall</em> and
\(a\) <em>is not tall</em> can both be true when \(a\) is borderline
tall (say, \(5'11'')\) while the full or reduced conjunction of these
statements, <em>a is tall and (a is) not tall,</em> will be false,
given the standard supervaluationist approach. Alxatib &amp;
Pelletier, however, find the opposite judgments among a majority of
the subjects of their study, who accept the conjunction while
rejecting the individual ascriptions of truth. In addition to
reinforcing the view of gappy and glutty theories as mirror images,
Alxatib &amp; Pelletier present their results as evidence against the
neo-classical vagueness-as-ignorance position of Bonini et al. (1999),
a position which also has difficulty accounting for the paucity of
subjects choosing the &ldquo;can&rsquo;t tell&rdquo; option in the
surveys. Like the assertability-based pragmatic theory of borderline
contradictions proposed by Kyburg, Alxatib &amp; Pelletier (2011: 321)
offer a Gricean explanation for subjects&rsquo; endorsement of the
truth of apparent contradictory statements&mdash;<em>a is tall and not
tall</em> when a is just short of 6 feet tall&mdash;which yields (in
just this case) a subvaluationary interpretation on which the speaker
is taken to convey the borderline status of \(a\)&rsquo;s height.
Their central finding (2011: 298&ndash;9) is that theories admitting
truth-value gaps like that of Hyde (1997) or the paraconsistent logic
of Priest 2006 fare better in accounting for the full range of
interesting data presented in their experiments&mdash;and those of
Ripley 2011.</p>

<p>
Like Alxatib &amp; Pelletier, Ripley (2011: &sect;2) conducts his own
survey of reactions to apparent contradictions involving vague
predications (e.g., &ldquo;The circle is both is and isn&rsquo;t near
the square&rdquo;; &ldquo;The circle neither is nor isn&rsquo;t near
the square&rdquo;). He leverages the results of his study to argue
against error (or epistemic) theories on which borderline
contradictions are always false even when believed true; he also
refutes fuzzy theories of vagueness, which fail to predict why
subjects are so willing to accept the truth of borderline
contradictions rather than assigning them an intermediate
acceptability ranking. Ripley also finds pragmatic or contextualist
theories not insufficiently fleshed out to yield the correct
predictions. He adopts a dialetheist account that enables him to line
up with a majority of his subjects in finding both &ldquo;\(a\) is
\(F\) and \(a\) is not \(F\)&rdquo; and &ldquo;\(a\) is neither \(F\)
nor not \(F\)&rdquo; true for borderline applications of \(F\).
Supporting this view, he notes (2011: 186&ndash;7) that there may be
variation with respect to the &ldquo;cultural aversion to
contradictions&rdquo;; there is evidence tending to suggest that Asian
subjects are less likely than Westerners (specifically, as it happens,
Canadians) to object to contradictions like &ldquo;It&rsquo;s raining
and it&rsquo;s not raining.&rdquo; But as Ripley concedes, more
research is needed on this point.</p>

<h2 id="ContEverLife">7. Contradiction in everyday life</h2>

<p>
The logical incoherence of contradictions is the ground both for
indecision (as with Zerlina&rsquo;s ambivalent <em>Vorrei e non
vorrei</em> in our epigraph) and for the pragmatic exploitation of
apparent contradictions for communicative ends. One locus is the
oxymoron, a phrasal contradiction exploited for millennia as a figure
of speech. The dramatic effect of yoking contradictories is as old as
the classical <em>festina lente</em> (&lsquo;make haste slowly&rsquo;)
adopted as a motto by Augustine and the Medicis. The German
counterpart, deployed by Goethe and others, adds rhyme: <em>Eile mit
Weile</em>. In the Catholic tradition, the fall of man is regarded as
<em>felix culpa, </em>a happy fault or sin, leading as it does to
redemption. On a more mundane level we have such one-word oxymorons as
<em>agathokakological,</em> &lsquo;both good and evil&rsquo;, and more
colloquially the <em>humblebrag,</em> in which an intended instance of
self-promotion is concealed within false modesty or self-deprecation.
Perhaps the most interesting instance is the <em>sophomore,</em>
reconstructed as a partial folk etymology from <em>sophos
</em>(&lsquo;wise&rsquo;, as in <em>philosophy</em>) + <em>moros
</em>(&lsquo;fool&rsquo;, as in <em>moron&mdash;</em>or
<em>oxymoron</em>).</p>

<p>
The use of actual or apparent contradiction to generate meanings via
reconstrual may convey advice to seek the middle way, reminiscent of
the function of borderline contradictions surveyed in &sect;6, or may,
in the case of an apparently incoherent phrasal structure, serve as a
signal that the modifier constrains the denotation of the head. Thus
<em>bittersweet</em> is not taken as a self-contradictory property,
while a <em>tragicomedy</em> is a work or production that spans the
two normally opposed genres&mdash;recall Walt Whitman&rsquo;s &ldquo;I
am large; I contain multitudes&rdquo;. Classic modifier&ndash;head
oxymorons include <em>cruel kindness,</em> <em>living death,</em> and
<em>true lies;</em> jocular ones are regularly proposed, from
<em>military intelligence</em> and <em>congressional ethics</em> to
<em>airplane food</em> and <em>open secrets</em>. A particularly
transparent form is offered by those promoting <em>undesign
design</em> or the <em>non-concept concept.</em></p>

<p>
The oxymoron, and in particular the bard&rsquo;s catalogue of
oxymorons, may also be rcruited to signal the breakdown of logical
coherence, given the explosive effect of <em>ex contradictione
quodlibet</em>. In <em>Romeo and Juliet,</em> we ascend from the
former&rsquo;s risible inventory of battling binaries to the
latter&rsquo;s ardent valediction on her balcony:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
<br />
O anything, of nothing first create!
<br />
O heavy lightness! Serious vanity!
<br />
Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
<br />
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;<em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, I.i</p>

<p>
Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow
<br />
That I should say good night till it be morrow.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;<em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, II.ii</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Expanding from the phrasal to the sentential level, we find
self-contradictory propositions, whether in full or elliptical form,
functioning in forums from high culture to social media to generate a
variety of implicatures. In her recent study of the phenomenology of
ambivalence, Razinsky takes the affirmation of conjoined
contradictories &ldquo;a is \(v\) and a is not \(v\)&rdquo; for a
given value judgment \(v,\) or the affirmation of &ldquo;a is \(v\)
and a is <em>v&acute;</em>&rdquo; where <em>v, v&acute;</em> are
contraries (e.g. <em>a is good and a is bad</em>), to be
&ldquo;central to the logic of value and of value judgment&rdquo;
(2017: 229). Some apparent instances of ambivalence (and of any
underlying violation of LNC) can be explained away. Citing Mill,
Razinsky (2017: 201) accepts that there are instances in which <em>a
is just and a is unjust</em> reflects only an apparent opposition, to
be understood essentially as <em>a is just in some respects and a is
unjust in other respects</em>. Such cases illustrate the prescience of
the Aristotelian rider: &ldquo;a is \(F\)&rdquo; and &ldquo;a is not
\(F\)&rdquo; cannot both hold <em>in the same sense, at the same time,
and in the same respect</em>. Similarly, the imposition of the edict
\(a\) <em>ought to F and a ought not to F</em> results in difficulty
for the unfortunate \(a\), to be sure, but not necessarily in an LNC
violation, given the availability of distinct sources of obligation.
But other cases involve true ambivalence: &ldquo;Meaningful
contradictions are moored in the possibility of conceptual
ambivalence&rdquo; (Razinsky 2017: 44). The analysis of such cases
must preserve the dynamic tension in affirming that a is \(v\) and a
is <em>not-v</em> and at the same time acknowledge the speaker&rsquo;s
awareness of the violation of LNC, not an easy task: &ldquo;Do people
believe contradictions when it comes to value? I do not think there is
a good answer to give here&rdquo; (Razinsky 2017: 228)&mdash;they
believe them and do not believe them.</p>

<p>
Perhaps as a reflection of this tension, the A-not-A meme has widely
proliferated in popular entertainment, advertisements, and social
media. &ldquo;Sorry not sorry&rdquo; has become a standard device for
a sarcastic or insincere apology (also known as a &ldquo;non-apology
apology&rdquo;), while #SorryNotSorry is a trending Twitter hashtag as
well as a Demi Lovato song title (see Carey 2014 in Other Internet
Resources). The category of &ldquo;Christmas-not-Christmas
movies&rdquo; makes its perennial appearance on the web during holiday
season, and the #worknotwork has been adopted as the house meme of
Samsonite luggage. Of more immediate philosophical relevance is Nikhil
Krishnan&rsquo;s take on queerness and philosophers in his New Yorker
piece &ldquo;How Queer Was Ludwig Wittgenstein?&rdquo;:
&ldquo;[Socrates] was seen, even in his time, to be&mdash;using the
word advisedly&mdash;queer. Undoubtedly, that was the case in the
modern, <strong>pejorative-not-pejorative</strong> sense: he was
attracted to men. But he was also queer in ways that are harder to
define.&rdquo; A related meme is &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying,
I&rsquo;m just saying&rdquo;, a notorious &ldquo;get out of jail
free&rdquo; discourse ploy showing up in hundreds of google hits, as
the subject of several online commentaries by linguists (cf. Siegel
2005), and as the title of a 2012 flash fiction paperback by Matthew
Salesses.</p>

<p>
A relatively new means for expressing ambivalence in colloquial U.S.
and Australian English is the &ldquo;Yeah no&rdquo; (or, less
frequently, &ldquo;No yeah&rdquo;) response, which has been analyzed
as conveying a variety of possible discourse functions (see Burridge
&amp; Florey 2002, Lee-Goldman 2011, and Liberman 2008 in Other
Internet Resources).</p>

<p>
The conjunction of contradictory predicates of the form <em>not A
and/but not NOT A</em> is used to indicate the borderline status of an
entity with respect to a category and its complement:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>They not brown but they not NOT brown</strong>.

</ul>

<p>
While these may appear contradictory, that diagnosis relies on the
status of <em>S is not not P</em> as an instance of \(\neg(\neg\)(S is
P)) within a logic employing a robust Law of Double Negation.
Arguably, however, in each of these attestations, the inner
negation&mdash;<em>not brown, not classical, not healthy,</em> and
even <em>not-raining&mdash;</em>can be viewed as a coerced or virtual
contrary, in which case the two negations do not fully cancel out.
Thus, just as <em>not impossible</em> fails to reduce to <em>possible,
not not classical</em> is distinct from <em>classical,</em> and no
actual violation of LNC is ultimately condoned. But, as on
Grice&rsquo;s (1989) analysis of irony and tautology, it is the
recognition of the apparent contradiction that the speaker exploits to
generate the higher-order coherence of the message.</p>

<p>
A less, or perhaps differently, mediated case of coherence in apparent
contradictories involves prosody, such as &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t rich,
he&rsquo;s RICH&rdquo;, from Geurts (2010: 186). In this construction,
the hearer/reader must directly reconcile LNC with the joint
predication of \(A\) and <em>not A</em> rather than the more complex
<em>not A and not not A</em>. But on closer examination, the task is
less daunting than it appears, as it&rsquo;s really a matter of
affirming \(A\) while rejecting \(\boldsymbol{A},\) or of
metalinguistically rejecting \(A\) in favor of \(\boldsymbol{A}\):</p>

</ul>

<p>
The prosodic or orthographic focus in such cases invokes a scalar
contrast in degrees or qualities of A-ness; the result is analogous to
instances in which a descriptor is contrasted with a clone (Horn 2018)
or contrastive focus reduplication (Ghomeshi et al. 2004) of the same
descriptor, yielding variants of the true borderline contradictions
discussed in &sect;6. </p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>
Note the rhetorical if not truth-conditional contrast between a tycoon
protesting that he is <em>not RICH rich</em> and acknowledging that he
is <em>not NOT rich. </em>(See Stanton 2023 for more on the relation
between clones and prosodic intensification.) </p>

<p>
Finally, it is worth noting the role contradiction plays as a lively
source of ironic humor, especially for the highbrow reader. In one
 <a href="https://condenaststore.com/featured/a-veterinarian-confronts-a-man-in-the-waiting-benjamin-schwartz.html" target="other">New Yorker cartoon</a>
 (Benjamin Schwartz, March 30, 2015), a veterinarian comes into the
waiting room, places a comforting arm on the worried man&rsquo;s
shoulder, and breaks the news: &ldquo;About your cat, Mr.
Schr&ouml;dinger&mdash;I have good news and bad news.&rdquo; (See
&sect;4 above for more on the poor cat&rsquo;s indeterminate
prognosis.) In
 <a href="https://condenaststore.com/featured/i-wish-you-would-make-up-your-mind-jb-handelsman.html" target="other">another</a>
 (J. B. Handelsman, March 9, 1987), a mutton-chopped publisher, seated
at his Victorian office desk and riffling through an immense
manuscript, explains to the dejected bearded author, &ldquo;I wish you
would make up your mind, Mr. Dickens. Was it the best of times or was
it the worst of times? It could scarcely have both.&rdquo; .</p>

<p>
For my valedictory, I borrow the last words of Samuel Beckett&rsquo;s
<em>The Unnamable</em> (1954)&mdash;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go on,
I&rsquo;ll go on&rdquo;&mdash;since in fact I can&rsquo;t go on.</p>

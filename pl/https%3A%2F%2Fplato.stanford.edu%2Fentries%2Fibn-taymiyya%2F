<h1>Ibn Taymiyya</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed May 22, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Ibn Taymiyya (1263&ndash;1328) of Damascus was a prominent Sunn&#299;
religious scholar, activist, and reformer who sought to root out
religious innovation and return Islam to the Qur&#702;&#257;n, the
practice (<em>sunna</em>) of the Prophet Mu&#7717;ammad, and the
interpretations of the early Muslims (<em>salaf</em>). Ibn Taymiyya is
best known today as a major inspiration to the global Salafism
movement (Meijer 2009). A few modern scholars have heralded him as a
philosopher on account of his nominalism, empiricism, and similarities
with the philosopher Ibn Rushd (Averroes, d. 1198) (Ajhar 2014; Tamer
2013 provides a survey of such views). Others have denigrated him for
slavish traditionalism, literalism, and hatred of reason thanks to his
refutation of Aristotelian logic and his call for revelation-based
reform (e.g., Fakhry 2004: 326&ndash;9; Walbridge 2011: 5, 115). Ibn
Taymiyya was in fact very well read in the philosophical and
theological literature of his day (Michot 2000b: 599), and he deployed
extensive hermeneutical reflection and rational argumentation to
defend his interpretation of Islamic revelation as fully congruent
with reason. While it may go too far to call Ibn Taymiyya a
philosopher (Tamer 2013: 373), he was certainly an apologist for the
rationality of Islamic revelation, and there is much of philosophical
interest in his writings. Ibn Taymiyya&rsquo;s approach has thus been
called philosophical theology (Hoover 2004: 295) and
Qur&#702;&#257;nic rational theology (&Ouml;zervarli 2010: 78).</p>

<h2 id="LifeWork">1. Life and Works</h2>

<p>
Mongol invasions shaped Ibn Taymiyya&rsquo;s childhood and early
career. The Mongols conquered Baghdad in 1258 and established the
Ilkh&#257;nid Mongol Empire in Iraq and Persia, one of the four major
Mongol empires that together controlled the vast expanse of territory
from eastern Europe to the Korean peninsula. In 1260 the Maml&#363;k
rulers of Egypt and Syria halted the Ilkh&#257;nid Mongol advance from
the northeast at the Battle of &#703;Ayn J&#257;l&#363;t in Palestine.
Ahmad Ibn Taymiyya was born in 1263 (661 in the Islamic calendar) in
&#7716;arr&#257;n which is located today in southeastern Turkey. The
Maml&#363;ks controlled &#7716;arr&#257;n at the time, but later in
1269 Ibn Taymiyya&rsquo;s family fled a Mongol incursion and settled
in Damascus. His father was a &#7716;anbal&#299; religious scholar who
became head of the Sukkariyya madrasa. Ibn Taymiyya excelled at the
religious sciences and took over as head of the Sukkariyya in 1284
when his father died. Ibn Taymiyya found himself in theological
difficulty in 1298 for writing against the Ash&#703;ar&#299;
<em>kal&#257;m</em> theology of God&rsquo;s attributes. He was charged
with ascribing a body to God (<em>tajs&#299;m</em>), interrogated, and
then released. The issue of theological corporealism would reemerge
several years later. In the meantime, the Mongols invaded Syria three
times between 1299 and 1303. The Ilkh&#257;nid Mongols had converted
to Islam in 1295, which raised the ethical problem of Muslims fighting
Muslims. Ibn Taymiyya argued that the Maml&#363;ks must defend Islam
against the Mongols because the latter did not adhere to all the laws
of Islam and were motivated by their own interests rather than the
interests of religion. The Maml&#363;ks eventually repelled the
Mongols and enjoyed an extended period of peace and economic
prosperity.</p>

<p>
With the passing of the Mongol threat, Ibn Taymiyya agitated against
Sufi theology and popular religious practices that he believed
deviated from Islam and weakened Muslim society. In response, his
enemies among the religious scholars gained the support of the
Maml&#363;k political authorities to have him tried again for
theological corporealism. Three trials held in Damascus in January and
February 1306 were inconclusive. He was then summoned to Cairo, the
Mamluk capital, where he was convicted of corporealism and related
issues in April 1306 and imprisoned for 18 months. In April 1308 he
was imprisoned again in Cairo for another 16 months following a
disturbance with Sufis. He was transferred to Alexandria in August
1309 and placed under house arrest for eight more months. Ibn Taymiyya
then enjoyed three years of calm in Cairo. In 1313 he returned to
Damascus where he spent the rest of his life writing and teaching a
small circle of disciples. This period was punctuated by disputes with
religious scholars that led to Mamluk state intervention. In 1318 he
was imprisoned for five and one-half months for issuing unorthodox
opinions about divorce oaths. He suffered further imprisonment in 1326
for teaching against undertaking travel to graves to seek intercession
through the dead. He remained in prison until his death in September
1328 (728 in the Islamic calendar).</p>

<p>
Ibn Taymiyya did not write systematic works of theology or philosophy.
He instead left a vast corpus of refutations and fatwas of widely
varying lengths and degrees of organization. It is difficult to date
Ibn Taymiyya&rsquo;s writings, and it is for this reason challenging
to trace development in his thought. Nonetheless, it is possible to
sequence his three largest theological tomes. Ibn Taymiyya wrote
<em>Explication of the Deceit of the Jahmiyya</em> (<em>Bay&#257;n
talb&#299;s al-Jahmiyya</em>), a refutation of Ash&#703;ar&#299;
incorporealism, during his first 12 months in prison in Egypt, that
is, between April 1306 and April 1307. He composed his masterwork
<em>Averting the Conflict between Reason and Revealed Tradition</em>
(<em>Dar&#702; ta&#703;&#257;ru&#7693; al-&#703;aql wa-l-naql</em>)
sometime after 1313 followed by his refutation of Twelver
Sh&#299;&#703;ism <em>The Way of the Prophetic Sunna</em>
(<em>Minh&#257;j al-sunna al-nabawiyya</em>). These three works take
up ten, eleven, and nine volumes, respectively, in their modern Arabic
critical editions. Ibn Taymiyya also wrote large works on law,
prophecy, and Christianity. Of special philosophical interest is his
<em>Refutation of the Logicians</em> (<em>al-Radd &#703;al&#257;
al-man&#7789;iqiyy&#299;n</em>), which he started while under house
arrest in Alexandria in 1309&ndash;1310 and completed later in
Damascus. Also of interest is Ibn Taymiyya&rsquo;s work on political
theology <em>Law-Guided Public Policy</em> (<em>al-Siy&#257;sa
al-Shar&#703;iyya</em>), which appears to have been drafted around
1310 and then completed upon his return to Damascus. While Ibn
Taymiyya&rsquo;s large works have been published separately, a great
many of his small and medium length writings have been published in
collections, the most cited of which is the 37 volume
<em>Majm&#363;&#703; fat&#257;w&#257;</em> first published
1961&ndash;7 (Murad 1979; Bori 2009, 2010, 2021; Hoover 2019b:
1&ndash;39).</p>

<h2 id="Onto">2. Ontology</h2>

<p>
Contrary to the dominant currents of post-classical Islamic thought,
Ibn Taymiyya&rsquo;s ontology is physicalist or materialist. All
existents, including God, are concrete particulars capable of being
perceived (<em>ma&#7717;&#7779;&#363;&#7779;</em>) by the five senses
of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. Whatever cannot be
perceived by the five senses does not exist. Even existents in the
unseen world (<em>&#703;&#257;lam al-ghayb</em>) are accessible to
sense perception under certain conditions. The unseen, according to
Ibn Taymiyya, is not an intellectual world or a world of immaterial
images. Instead, the unseen world, like the seen, consists of concrete
particulars with temporal and spatial dimensions that may be perceived
by the senses when unimpeded. Among other things, the unseen includes
God, angels, the afterlife, and the human soul, which is distinct from
the human body but not immaterial. Some things in the unseen world
have already been perceived in this life by prophets in visions and
dreams, and believers will see God in front of them with their eyes in
the hereafter. God is in fact more seeable than any other existent
because God&rsquo;s existence is more perfect than the existence of
anything else. Conversely, according to Ibn Taymiyya, the incorporeal
God of <em>kal&#257;m</em> theology and philosophers like Ibn
S&#299;n&#257; (Avicenna, d. 1037) and Ibn Rushd is tantamount to a
nonexistent. That God is no more than a concept in the mind (Moustafa
2017; Suleiman 2019: 98&ndash;102; El-Tobgui 2020: 230&ndash;5,
251&ndash;2; Hoover 2022: 647&ndash;8).</p>

<p>
Parallel to this physicalism, Ibn Taymiyya denies that universals
exist in extramental reality. He rejects universals existing
independently of particulars (Platonic realism) or as shared essences
or quiddities (<em>m&#257;hiyy&#257;t</em>) within particulars that
the mind abstracts as universals (Aristotelian and Avicennan moderate
realism). Shared meanings and universal notions abstracted from
concrete particulars in the extramental world exist only in the mind.
There is for example no extramental &ldquo;absolute human&rdquo; in
which concrete and particular humans participate or of which they are
instantiations, and there is no real quiddity &ldquo;human&rdquo; that
exists in every human. There are only ontologically distinct existents
that a mind groups together under a shared meaning or mental universal
called &ldquo;human&rdquo;. Ibn Taymiyya&rsquo;s rejection of real
universals is often called &ldquo;nominalism&rdquo; (e.g., Hallaq
1993: xvi&ndash;xxiv), but it has also been argued that
&ldquo;conceptualism&rdquo; is the better label. Conceptualism
acknowledges the existence of universals in the mind whereas
nominalism may imply rejection of that as well (Suleiman 2019:
106&ndash;19).</p>

<p>
For Ibn Taymiyya, extramental existents do share in the fact of
existing and in the fact of having unique essences and quiddities:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Between any two existents is something that they share and something
that distinguishes them. They must share in being two existents that
subsist and obtain, and in each one having a reality
(<em>&#7717;aq&#299;qa</em>), which is its essence
(<em>dh&#257;t</em>), its identify (<em>nafs</em>) and its quiddity,
even if the two existents are obviously different as in the case of
black and white. (<em>Dar&#702; ta&#703;&#257;ru&#7693;</em>
5:83&ndash;4) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is then the unique essences that distinguish existents from each
other and render them all completely unique individuals. The essence
of something is in fact its very existence along with its attributes
(El-Tobgui 2020: 246&ndash;50). Ibn Taymiyya&rsquo;s views on
universals are not entirely unique within post-classical Islam; he is
part of a wider drift toward nominalism or conceptualism found in
earlier figures such as Shih&#257;b al-D&#299;n al-Suhraward&#299; (d.
1191) (Adamson &amp; Benevich 2023: 189&ndash;256).</p>

<p>
Ibn Taymiyya also maintains that certain rational principles obtain
universally, both in the mind and in extramental reality. These
principles accord with his physicalist ontology, and they include
logical axioms like the law of noncontradiction and the law of the
excluded middle. It is not possible, for example, that something exist
and not exist at the same time or that something exist neither inside
the world nor outside of it. Likewise, one of two existents cannot be
neither suffused within the other nor distinct from it. Ibn Taymiyya
also affirms the division of existents into two fundamental types.
Every existent is either eternal or originated, necessary or possible,
and self-subsisting or subsisting in another. He insists on the
universal applicability of efficient causality as well. Nothing
possible or temporal can come into existence without a sufficient
cause. Everything originated requires an originator
(<em>mu&#7717;dith</em>), and everything preponderated needs a
preponderator (<em>murajj&#299;&#7717;</em>). It is for this reason,
Ibn Taymiyya maintains, that normally functioning human beings
perceive directly from their own existence that there must be a God
who created them (El-Tobgui 2020: 255&ndash;60, 283).</p>

<h2 id="Epis">3. Epistemology</h2>

<h3 id="WaysKnow">3.1 Ways of Knowing</h3>

<p>
Ibn Taymiyya&rsquo;s epistemology is based on sense perception
(<em>&#7717;iss</em>), report (<em>khabar</em>), reason
(<em>&#703;aql</em>), and the human natural constitution
(<em>fi&#7789;ra</em>). Sense perception is both outer and inner.
Outer sense perception comes through the five senses. It perceives the
particulars of the visible world in this life, and it perceives God in
the hereafter. Inner sense perception is of hunger, thirst, joy, pain,
the existence of one&rsquo;s own soul, and the existence of God. Sense
perception, according to Ibn Taymiyya, is immediate and necessary in
the sense that it cannot be denied.</p>

<p>
Report is related to sense perception insofar as it derives from the
sense perceptions of others who have experienced what they report.
Reports may be of particulars and universals and of the seen and the
unseen. Much of what we know comes from reports because our own sense
perception is limited in range. Divine revelation constitutes a
special category of reports providing knowledge about the unseen world
and the hereafter. Reports provide certain knowledge only if they are
so abundantly transmitted as to preclude collusion and forgery.
Muslims consider the Qur&#702;&#257;n and some reports from the
Prophet Mu&#7717;ammad to be abundantly transmitted
(<em>mutaw&#257;tur</em>). Ibn Taymiyya regards some reports of the
early Muslims, the <em>salaf</em>, to be abundantly transmitted as
well (El-Tobgui 2020: 227&ndash;9, 235&ndash;41).</p>

<p>
Reason for Ibn Taymiyya is both a rational faculty and a kind of
immediate (<em>bad&#299;h&#299;</em>) and necessary
(<em>&#7693;ar&#363;r&#299;</em>) knowledge. The latter includes
logical axioms like those noted above (e.g., the law of excluded
middle and the law of non-contradiction) and basic moral intuitions
(e.g., that God must be the only object of worship and that what is
beneficial is good). The functions of reason as a faculty include
forming universals in the mind from the extramental concrete
particulars known through the senses and carrying out rational
inferences (El-Tobgui 2020: 253&ndash;60).</p>

<p>
The <em>fi&#7789;ra</em> frames Ibn Taymiyya&rsquo;s epistemological
outlook as the &ldquo;original normative disposition&rdquo; (El-Tobgui
2020: 260) or &ldquo;natural constitution&rdquo; (Hoover 2007: 39) of
the human being to believe in and worship God alone just as an infant
instinctively seeks to drink its mother&rsquo;s milk. God creates
human beings with a Godward orientation, and this includes many things
known by reason such as the basic rules of thought and fundamental
moral intuitions. Corrupting influences and incorrect <em>kalam</em>
and philosophical reasoning may divert the <em>fi&#7789;ra</em> from
its proper ends. The role of prophecy and divine revelation then is to
perfect the <em>fi&#7789;ra</em> by removing sources of corruption,
providing correct arguments, and revealing aspects of the divine law
not known through natural means (Holtzman 2010: 165&ndash;78; Anjum
2012: 215&ndash;27; Kazi 2013: 232&ndash;313; Vasalou 2016:
77&ndash;92; El-Tobgui 2020: 260&ndash;4; Candiard 2023:
309&ndash;28).</p>

<p>
Apart from prophecy, Ibn Taymiyya also appeals to the collective
<em>fi&#7789;ra</em> of humankind to secure the reliability of sensory
knowledge and rational axioms against the corrupt reasoning of
<em>kal&#257;m</em> theologians and philosophers. For example, the
axiom that one of two existents is either suffused within the other or
distinct from it is so abundantly transmitted from ordinary people of
sound <em>fi&#7789;ra</em> as to preclude collusion and error. This
unmasks the faulty reasoning of theologians of corrupted
<em>fi&#7789;ra</em> who posit a third type of existent that is
neither suffused within another existent nor distinct from it (i.e.,
God). With this, abundant transmission (<em>taw&#257;&#7789;ur</em>)
guarantees for Ibn Taymiyya not only the authenticity of divine
revelation but also the certainty of knowledge that accords with
logical axioms and sense perception (El-Tobgui 2018a; El-Tobgui 2020:
267&ndash;75).</p>

<h3 id="RefuArisLogi">3.2 Refutation of Aristotelian Logic</h3>

<p>
Ibn Taymiyya devotes his <em>Refutation of the Logicians</em>
(<em>al-Radd &#703;al&#257; al-man&#7789;iyy&#299;n</em>) to
Aristotelian logic as reformulated by Ibn S&#299;n&#257;. The
Avicennan logical system is foundationalist. New knowledge is built up
from primary knowledge through discursive reasoning. Otherwise,
without a foundation of primary knowledge, rational inferences would
regress infinitely. Avicennan logic furthermore divides knowledge
(<em>&#703;ilm</em>) into conceptualization (<em>ta&#7779;awwur</em>)
and assent (<em>ta&#7779;d&#299;q</em>). Conceptualization is the
formation of a notion or concept in the mind. Some concepts like
&ldquo;thing&rdquo; and &ldquo;existent&rdquo; are primary; they are
known immediately without discursive reasoning (<em>na&#7827;ar</em>).
Other concepts are acquired by formation of a real definition
(<em>&#7717;add</em>), which indicates the essence or quiddity
(<em>m&#257;hiyya</em>) of a species by specifying its genus and
specific difference. For example, the definition of
&ldquo;human&rdquo; as &ldquo;rational animal&rdquo; is acquired
through reflection on prior knowledge of the species
&ldquo;animal&rdquo; and the specific difference
&ldquo;rational&rdquo;. The definition generates a concept in the mind
that corresponds to the quiddity of the existing thing in extramental
reality. Assent, the second division of Avicennan logic, affirms the
truthfulness of a proposition. Assents are also primary or acquired,
and they may be either certain (<em>yaq&#299;n</em>) or probable.
Primary assents that are certain include, among other things, primary
truths (e.g., the whole is greater than the part); sense perceptions
(e.g., seeing that the sun is shining), and abundantly transmitted
reports (e.g., of the existence of a given city). Probable primary
assents include beliefs about human customs and laws. Acquired assents
are derived through induction, analogy, and syllogism. Induction and
analogy impart no more than probability, but a valid categorical
syllogism with certain premises provides apodictic certainty. Such a
syllogism is called a demonstration (<em>burh&#257;n</em>) (Inati
1984; Hallaq 1993: xiv&ndash;xvii, xxvii&ndash;xxviii, 4&ndash;5 n. 4;
Ahmed 2011; Black 2013).</p>

<p>
Ibn Taymiyya falls within a tradition going back to the twelfth
century that subjected Ibn S&#299;n&#257;&rsquo;s Aristotelian notion
of real definition to skeptical critique. He rejects the ontology
underpinning Avicennan definitions: definitions do not delineate real
Avicennan quiddities shared by multiple existents outside the mind,
and the attributes of extramental realities are not divided into those
which are quiddative or essential and those which are not. Ibn
Taymiyya maintains instead that definitions are matters of linguistic
convention. They simply name and identify what is defined, and they
distinguish one thing from another. This is the view of definitions
common among <em>kal&#257;m</em> theologians. Following on from this,
Ibn Taymiyya asserts that Aristotelian definitions are not needed to
form concepts and that in fact, as the Ash&#703;ar&#299; theologian
Fakhr al-D&#299;n al-R&#257;z&#299; (d. 606/1210) argued earlier, real
definitions cannot lead to the acquisition of conceptualizations at
all. Conceptualizations are all primary and empirical in character;
they arise from experience and the senses, both external (e.g., sight
and hearing) and internal (e.g., hunger, pain, love). Aristotelian
definitions do not impart knowledge not already known. Those who hear
definitions will not understand them unless they have previously
conceptualized and understood the terms used to form the definitions
themselves. The definition of human as rational animal for example is
merely an assertion of the person who defines it. A hearer who knows
this to be true will know it based on prior knowledge and not from the
definition. A hearer who does not know it to be true cannot be sure
that the testimony of this one person who defined it is correct
without further corroboration (<em>Man&#7789;iqiyy&#299;n</em>
7&ndash;87/49&ndash;129; Hallaq 1993: xvii&ndash;xx, xlvi&ndash;xlvii;
von K&uuml;gelgen 2005: 179&ndash;204; Rayan 2009, 2010, 2011b; on
earlier critiques of definition, including al-R&#257;z&#299;&rsquo;s,
see Jacobsen Ben Hammed 2020; Griffel 2021: 312&ndash;3, 336&ndash;87;
Benevich 2022).</p>

<p>
Ibn Taymiyya also denounces the logicians&rsquo; demonstrative
syllogism as unnecessary and useless for acquiring certain knowledge.
He does affirm that a categorical syllogism is formally productive. It
yields certainty if its premises are certain: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If the subject matter of the syllogistic form is known [with
certainty], then there is no doubt that it yields certainty. If it is
said that every A is B and every B is C, and the two premises are
known [with certainty], then there is no doubt that this combination
yields [certain] knowledge that every A is C. This is not disputed.
(<em>Man&#7789;iqiyy&#299;n</em> 293/339; cf. Hallaq 1993: 141) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
However, Ibn Taymiyya belittles the Aristotelian and Avicennan
elaboration of syllogistic figures and conditions as unduly complex
and of little worth: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The upshot of the multiplicity of these figures and conditions is
prolixity of little use and much weariness. They are lean camel meat
on a rugged mountain peak that is not easy to climb, and [the meat]
not ample enough to be worth carrying down.
(<em>Man&#7789;iqiyy&#299;n</em> 296/342&ndash;3; cf. Hallaq 1993:
141)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
More substantively, Ibn Taymiyya argues that certain knowledge may be
acquired without a categorical syllogism. Different people come to
certainty in different ways. What is acquired knowledge for some may
be immediate knowledge for others. Some need the middle term of a
syllogism to acquire certain knowledge while others do not. A rational
inference producing certainty also need not be composed of exactly two
premises, counter to what logicians require for a demonstrative
syllogism. The number of premises varies according to the ability of
the one seeking knowledge, and some inferences require only one
premise, that is, a single indicant (<em>dal&#299;l</em>) with its
necessarily entailment (<em>luz&#363;m</em>). As an example, Ibn
Taymiyya notes that every created thing known with certainty to exist
entails the existence of the Creator necessarily. The argument does
not need to be reformulated into a categorical syllogism to provide
certainty, and to require the syllogistic form is mere pedantry.
Moreover, and following on from Ibn Taymiyya&rsquo;s empiricist
outlook, the universal proposition in a demonstrative syllogism is in
fact superfluous in matters pertaining to the extramental world
because knowledge of that world is rooted in particulars. For example,
to determine whether the universal, &ldquo;All flames burn&rdquo;, is
true in the world outside the mind, one would need to examine all
flames to see whether they all burn. In this attempt at complete
induction, one would discover along the way that a particular flame
burns. There would then be no need to construct a demonstrative
syllogism with the universal premise, &ldquo;All flames burn&rdquo;,
to attain certainty that that one flame burns. It has already been
ascertained that it burns. Additionally, in view of the difficulty of
achieving complete induction of particulars, acquired knowledge of the
extramental world will be merely probable, not certain
(<em>Man&#7789;iqiyy&#299;n</em> 113&ndash;4/155,
250&ndash;3/294&ndash;7; Hallaq 1993: xxvii&ndash;xxxv, 30&ndash;42,
134&ndash;7; von K&uuml;gelgen 2005: 204&ndash;9; Rayan 2011a,
2012).</p>

<p>
Ibn Taymiyya also claims in his <em>Refutation of the Logicians</em>
that the categorical syllogism is equivalent to analogy: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Analogy (<em>qiy&#257;s al-tamth&#299;l</em>) and the categorical
syllogism (<em>qiy&#257;s al-shum&#363;l</em>) are equivalent.
Certainty (<em>yaq&#299;n</em>) and probability (<em>&#7827;ann</em>)
differ only according to the subject matter [of the premises]. If the
specific subject matter is certain in one, it is certain in the other,
and, if it is probable in one, it is probable in the other.
(<em>Man&#7789;iqiyy&#299;n</em> 116/157, cf. 6/48, 200&ndash;1/244)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
According to Aristotelian and Avicennan logic, an analogy can never
impart certain knowledge because it only compares one particular with
another. An analogy transfers a judgement or property found in one
particular to the second particular by virtue of a characteristic
shared between the two. The cause (<em>&#703;illa</em>) of this shared
characteristic can never be ascertained with complete certainty, and
so an analogy can never impart certain knowledge.</p>

<p>
Contrary to this, Ibn Taymiyya contends that the middle term of the
categorical syllogism is identical to the cause in analogy and that an
analogy can be reformulated as the first figure of a categorical
syllogism. He illustrates with the famous juristic case of date wine
(<em>nab&#299;dh</em>). Date wine is forbidden by analogy to grape
wine because both intoxicate. Intoxication is the cause of forbiddance
in both the original and the assimilated cases. Likewise, date wine is
forbidden by the following demonstration: every date wine is an
intoxicant; every intoxicant is forbidden; therefore, date wine is
forbidden. Ibn Taymiyya acknowledges that the greatest question
concerning analogy is how to ascertain that the characteristic shared
by the original and assimilated cases (e.g., intoxication) causes or
necessitates the ruling (e.g., forbiddance). However, he explains,
that is no different from the equally difficult problem of identifying
the middle term in a categorical syllogism. If the middle term is
certainly the cause and the premises are certain, that forms a
demonstration. Otherwise, the major premise in the syllogism will be
only probable, and the conclusion will likewise be only probable. As
noted above, Ibn Taymiyya maintains that it is not possible to acquire
certain knowledge of universal propositions in extramental reality
(e.g., that all flames burn), and so he effectively reduces the
categorical syllogism to the epistemic level of analogy as a tool for
acquiring new knowledge of the world outside the mind.</p>

<p>
Ibn Taymiyya furthermore explains that once the necessitating cause in
an analogy has been identified (e.g., intoxication as the cause of
forbiddance), it becomes a universal, and the original case in the
analogical argument is no longer needed. Whenever the cause obtains,
the ruling follows necessarily. Yet, Ibn Taymiyya continues, a
universal only exists with respect to a particular case, and
specifying the original case is how the universal comes to be known
(<em>Man&#7789;iqiyy&#299;n</em> 116&ndash;8/158&ndash;60). For Ibn
Taymiyya, it is divine revelation that makes the cause of a ruling
known. In the case of date wine, it is known from the consensus of the
Muslim community and unambiguous revealed texts that every intoxicant
is forbidden. Among unambiguous texts are two statements of the
Prophet Mu&#7717;ammad in the hadith collection of Muslim:
&ldquo;Every intoxicant is wine (<em>khamr</em>), and every intoxicant
is forbidden&rdquo;, and, &ldquo;Every intoxicant is wine, and every
wine is forbidden&rdquo; (<em>Man&#7789;iqiyy&#299;n</em>
111&ndash;2/152&ndash;3; Heer 1988; Hallaq 1993: xxxv&ndash;xxxviii,
43&ndash;51, 159&ndash;64; von K&uuml;gelgen 2005: 209&ndash;12; von
K&uuml;gelgen 2013: 313&ndash;22). Divine revelation can provide
certain knowledge of the world outside the mind even if empirical
observation of extramental particulars cannot. This leads Hallaq to
call Ibn Taymiyya &ldquo;an ardent sceptic, but a sceptic saved by
religion&rdquo; (Hallaq 1993: xxxix). However, Hallaq&rsquo;s comment
is apt only to a point because, as will be seen below, Ibn Taymiyya
maintains that knowledge about God may be derived through rational
inferences as well.</p>

<p>
Ibn Taymiyya&rsquo;s <em>Refutation of the Logicians</em> received
very little attention from logicians in his own day or in the
following centuries (von K&uuml;gelgen 2013: 270&ndash;3). One
possible reason for this is that he does not take the later logical
tradition into account. Arab logicians from the twelfth century onward
are not uniformly committed to the existence of extramental
universals, as noted above, nor to the Avicennan claim that
definitions and demonstrative syllogisms are the only means to acquire
certain knowledge through rational reflection (Spevack 2010). Another
possible reason is that Ibn Taymiyya is sometimes imprecise. For
example, he reports baldly that the logicians claim, &ldquo;No assents
are known except by means of the syllogism&rdquo;
(<em>Man&#7789;iqiyy&#299;n</em> 88/130). As a few modern scholars
have noted, this is not true when taken at face value; Avicennan
logicians also recognize a variety of primary assents, as well as
probable assents acquired through induction or analogy (Hallaq 1993:
30; El-Rouayheb 2016: 418). Ibn Taymiyya is aware of this wider
teaching about assent (<em>Man&#7789;iqiyy&#299;n</em>
4&ndash;7/46&ndash;8), and it becomes apparent during his
<em>Refutation</em> that he is addressing the more limited claim that
no acquired, certain assents are known except by means of the
categorical syllogism. In sum Ibn Taymiyya&rsquo;s imprecision and the
fact that he gives later logical developments minimal attention may
help explain why pre-modern logicians did not interact with his
criticism (El-Rouayheb 2016: 417&ndash;22).</p>

<h2 id="PhilTheo">4. Philosophical Theology</h2>

<h3 id="TheoLang">4.1 Theological Language</h3>

<p>
As a theological traditionalist within the &#7716;anbal&#299; school
of Sunn&#299; Islam, Ibn Taymiyya affirms that God must be described
as the Qur&#702;&#257;n and the Prophet Mu&#7717;ammad describe Him,
both negatively and positively, in accord with the Qur&#702;&#257;nic
verse, &ldquo;There is nothing like Him, and He is All-Hearing,
All-Seeing&rdquo; (Q. 42:11). On the one hand, God&rsquo;s revealed
names and attributes are incomparable (<em>tanz&#299;h</em>), and they
must not be likened (<em>tamth&#299;l</em>) or assimilated
(<em>tashb&#299;h</em>) to creatures. On the other, attributes like
God&rsquo;s hearing and seeing must be affirmed in their plain sense
(<em>&#7827;&#257;hir</em>) according to the interpretation
(<em>tafs&#299;r</em>) of the <em>salaf</em> and not distorted
(<em>ta&#7717;r&#299;f</em>) or stripped away
(<em>ta&#703;&#7789;&#299;l</em>).</p>

<p>
The polemic against likening and stripping away is aimed at two broad
trends. First, according to Ibn Taymiyya, Mu&#703;tazil&#299; and
post-classical Ash&#703;ar&#299; <em>kal&#257;m</em> theologians liken
God&rsquo;s attributes to those of creatures. Then, they strip God of
those attributes that imply anthropomorphism and corporealism and
sometimes reinterpret them. God cannot have a literal
&ldquo;hand&rdquo;, for example, and so the literal sense must be
denied and perhaps reinterpreted non-literally as God&rsquo;s
&ldquo;power&rdquo;. Likewise, it must be denied that God&rsquo;s
&ldquo;sitting&rdquo; has anything to do with motion, place, or space,
and it may perhaps be reinterpreted as God&rsquo;s
&ldquo;possessing&rdquo;. Ibn Taymiyya rejects the <em>kal&#257;m</em>
approach and insists that all God&rsquo;s attributes must be affirmed
equally as uniquely befitting God. Divine attributes that could imply
corporeality may not be denied while other attributes are affirmed
(Hoover 2007: 48&ndash;52).</p>

<p>
The second target of Ibn Taymiyya&rsquo;s polemic is the esotericism
of Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l&#299; Sh&#299;&#703;&#299;s, philosophers in
the Neoplatonic and Aristotelian traditions, al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; (d.
1111), and the Sufi theorist Ibn al-&#703;Arab&#299; (d. 1240) and his
followers. Esotericism affirms two meanings for revelation, one for
the commoners and another for an elite. The philosophers Ibn
S&#299;n&#257; and Ibn Rushd, for example, understand the corporeal
imagery of exoteric revelation as pious fiction for the commoners. The
commoners should not be told what the philosophers know to be true,
namely, that God and the hereafter are incorporeal. That would too
easily suggest to commoners that God and the hereafter do not exist at
all and so undermine their faith. Ibn Taymiyya welcomes the
philosophers&rsquo; rejection of <em>kal&#257;m</em> reinterpretation
at the exoteric level, but he fiercely condemns their esoteric
interpretations confined to an elite. The revelation that is
accessible to all is true for all in its plain sense (Michot 2003a,
2008, 2012a, 2015, 2019; von K&uuml;gelgen 2004).</p>

<p>
A major stream of theological traditionalism prohibits debating with
<em>kal&#257;m</em> theologians and shuns all attempts to understand
God&rsquo;s attributes. This traditionalist noncognitivism deems the
meaning (<em>ma&#703;n&#257;</em>) and the condition or modality
(<em>kayfiyya</em>) of the attributes to be entirely inaccessible to
human comprehension. While the verbal forms of &ldquo;hearing&rdquo;
and &ldquo;hand&rdquo; are the same when applied to God and creatures,
the meanings of these words when applied to God are unknowable and
must not be probed (Hoover with Mahajneh 2018: 43&ndash;7).</p>

<p>
Ibn Taymiyya retains the unknowability of the modality of God&rsquo;s
attributes, as well as their ultimate reality
(<em>&#7717;aq&#299;qa</em>), but he rejects traditionalist
noncognitivism. He also rejects the literalism of <em>kal&#257;m</em>
theology. Words like &ldquo;hand&rdquo; and &ldquo;sitting&rdquo; do
not have literal meanings that must be denied and perhaps replaced
with other terms when applied to God. Rather, Ibn Taymiyya affirms,
the plain senses of God&rsquo;s attributes are accessible to human
cognition and shaped by their theological context. Ibn
Taymiyya&rsquo;s theory of meaning is contextual and pragmatic. Words
have no meanings apart from context, and their meanings are modulated
according to contextual indicators (Ali 2000: 87&ndash;114; Belhaj
2008; Mustafa 2018). Names and attributes applied to both God and
creatures have meanings in the human mind, but they apply to God and
creatures in different ways according to the precedence of God over
creatures. Universal meanings occur only in the mind, and there are no
real universals outside the mind. Yet, the mind identifies features in
the particulars of extramental reality that can be said to be shared,
albeit differently in the particulars that are God and creatures
because God is necessary while creatures are merely contingent or
possible. Adapting distinctions developed by Ibn S&#299;n&#257; and
his successors, Ibn Taymiyya construes the relation between the
meanings of terms applied to both God and humans as neither equivocal
nor purely univocal but analogical or modulated (<em>mushakkik</em>).
Ibn Taymiyya elaborates in a passage from his <em>Refutation of the
Logicians</em>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The names applied [both] to [God] and others are applied by way of
modulation (<em>tashk&#299;k</em>), which is a kind of general
univocity (<em>al-taw&#257;&#7789;u&#702; al-&#703;&#257;mm</em>). It
is neither a matter of equivocity, nor a matter of univocity in which
the individuals to which it applies are alike. Rather, it is a matter
of univocity in which the individuals to which it applies take
precedence over each other. For example, the word &ldquo;white&rdquo;
or &ldquo;black&rdquo; is applied to what is intense, like the
whiteness of snow, and to what is less [intense], like the whiteness
of ivory. Likewise, the word &ldquo;existence&rdquo; is applied to
[both] the necessary and the possible&hellip;.Modulated names must
have a shared universal meaning, even if that occurs only in the
mind&hellip;.The fact that the existence of the necessary is more
perfect than the existence of the possible does not prevent what is
called &ldquo;existence&rdquo; from being a universal meaning shared
between the two of them. This is likewise the case with regard to the
other names and attributes applied to the Creator and the creature,
like the names Living, Knowing, Powerful, Hearing, and Seeing, and
likewise with His attributes, like His knowledge, His power, His
mercy, His good pleasure, His anger, and His joy, and the rest of His
names and His attributes that the messengers applied to Him.
(<em>Man&#7789;iqiyy&#299;n</em> 155/198; see further Ali 2000:
114&ndash;25; Suleiman 2019: 145&ndash;77; El-Tobgui 2020:
193&ndash;206, 285&ndash;8; on the Avicennan background, see Janos
2022; Adamson &amp; Benovich 2023: 109&ndash;37)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Ibn Taymiyya willingness to discuss the meanings of God&rsquo;s
attributes opens the door to theological explanation and
argumentation. With his traditionalist sensibility, he often reminds
readers that the modality and reality of God&rsquo;s names and
attributes cannot be known. He also prefers to speak of God only in
words found in revealed texts. Nonetheless, he permits engaging the
terminologies of theological opponents as needed to clarify the
meanings of the revelation, and he justifies this by analogy to the
permission to translate the Qur&#702;&#257;n into other languages to
convey its message. He condemns the <em>kal&#257;m</em> theologians
for introducing innovated and non-scriptural technical terms like
substance (<em>jawhar</em>), accident (<em>&#703;ara&#7693;</em>),
body (<em>jism</em>), and spatial extension (<em>ta&#7717;ayyuz</em>)
into theological discourse, but he permits using such terms when
necessary to translate the revelation into the idiom of the day
(Hoover with Mahajneh 2018).</p>

<h3 id="ReasReve">4.2 Reason and Revelation</h3>

<p>
It is also Ibn Taymiyya&rsquo;s conviction that much of what is known
about God through revelation is known equally and primally from reason
and the human natural constitution (<em>fi&#7789;ra</em>). Prophets
complete and perfect what humans already know, and revelation
reiterates rational proofs relevant to religion and exposes incorrect
reasoning for what it is. There is therefore no conflict between true
revelation and correct reason, and this is the main claim to which Ibn
Taymiyya&rsquo;s devotes his masterwork <em>Averting the Conflict</em>
(<em>Dar&#702; ta&#703;&#257;ru&#7693;</em>). Ibn Taymiyya condemns
philosophers and post-classical <em>kal&#257;m</em> theologians like
the Ash&#703;ar&#299; Fakhr al-D&#299;n al-R&#257;z&#299; for demoting
the Qur&#702;&#257;n to mere information and subjecting it to alien
and erroneous regimes of reason that lead to stripping God of his
rightful attributes. Ibn Taymiyya&rsquo;s apologetic aim is to take
the rational high ground away from philosophers and
<em>kal&#257;m</em> theologians by showing that his theology is what
both reason and the texts of revelation indicate (Abrahamov 1992;
Michot 1994; Kazi 2013; Zouggar 2014; Griffel 2018; Hoover with
Mahajneh 2018; El-Tobgui 2020; Candiard 2023). What follows here and
in the following subsections will focus more on clarifying Ibn
Taymiyya&rsquo;s theological concepts than on their textual indicants.
We begin with the basics of his natural theology.</p>

<p>
As noted above, Ibn Taymiyya affirms that everything originated
requires a cause for its existence, and creatures thereby know
immediately that God exists by virtue of their need for a creator.
There is no need for the prolix reasoning of the <em>kal&#257;m</em>
cosmological argument for the existence of God from atoms and
accidents. Ibn Taymiyya furthermore upholds causal priority: a cause
is more perfect than its effect, and the cause is the source of the
effect&rsquo;s perfections. Likewise, the Creator is more perfect than
creatures, and it is from the Creator that creatures derive their
perfections. The perfections of God may therefore be inferred from the
perfections of creatures, apart from revelation. However, Ibn Taymiyya
does not permit inferring God&rsquo;s attributes from the attributes
of creatures with an analogy or categorical syllogism because that
would involve comparing God and creatures on equal terms. Instead, <em class="fr">a
fortiori</em> argumentation must be used to respect
God&rsquo;s incomparability. An <em class="fr">a fortiori</em>
argument (<em>qiy&#257;s al-awl&#257;</em>) transfers the judgment of
one case to a second case that is all the more worthy of that judgment
than the first. Applied to theology, God is all the worthier of
whatever perfections are found in creatures than are the creatures
themselves, and so perfections found in creatures must be all the more
so ascribed to God. Ibn Taymiyya explains:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is not permissible that God&mdash;Exalted is He&mdash;and another
be included in a categorical syllogism whose terms are on the same
level or in an analogy in which the judgment of the original case and
that of the assimilated case are on the same level. Indeed,
God&mdash;Exalted is He&mdash;there is nothing like Him, neither in
His essence which is mentioned through His names, nor in His
attributes, nor in His acts. However, the <em class="fr">a
fortiori</em> argument is followed with respect to Him. As He said,
&ldquo;And to God is the highest similitude (<em>al-mathal
al-a&#703;l&#257;</em>)&rdquo; (Q. 16:60). With respect to every
perfection and attribute praiseworthy in itself and devoid of
imperfection that belongs to some created, originated existents, it is
known that the Lord, Creator, Self-Subsistent, Everlasting, Eternal
and Necessary Existent in Himself is all the worthier of it, and [with
respect to] every imperfection and defect from which some originated,
possible creatures must be exonerated, the Lord, Creator, Holy, Peace,
Eternal, Necessary of Existence in Himself is all the worthier of
being exonerated from it. (<em>Shar&#7717;
al-I&#7779;bah&#257;niyya</em> 456&ndash;7; trans. adapted from Hoover
2007: 59)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On these grounds, Ibn Taymiyya reasons that God must be living,
knowing, powerful, seeing, hearing, and speaking. Otherwise, God would
be dead, ignorant, impotent, blind, deaf, and mute, respectively, and
He would be less perfect than living creatures that He has created.
Moreover, God must be moving and not immovable. Otherwise, God would
be inferior to inanimate objects, which can at least be moved by
something else. In similar fashion, God has hands because having the
ability to choose to act with hands is more perfect than not having
that ability. God also has the attributes of laughter and joy to
exclude crying and sadness which imply weakness. God furthermore loves
perfection and hates imperfection because it is more perfect to
distinguish perfection and imperfection through love and hate than not
to do so. However, God does not eat and drink because eating and
drinking imply need whereas having no need is more perfect than being
in need. Moreover, Ibn Taymiyya contends that it is in God&rsquo;s
perfection to be qualified by attributes of perfection such that He is
unlike created things (Hoover 2007: 56&ndash;67; Suleiman 2019:
225&ndash;59).</p>

<h3 id="GodSpac">4.3 God and Space</h3>

<p>
Ibn Taymiyya rationalizes a strand of traditionalism found in earlier
figures such as &#703;Uthm&#257;n b. Sa&#703;&#299;d
al-D&#257;rim&#299; (d. between 280/893 and 282/895) that
distinguishes God above from the world below spatially. Ibn Taymiyya
deems it a necessary truth of reason and the natural constitution
(<em>fi&#7789;ra</em>) that God is located above and distinct from the
universe in a spatial sense. God is above the sky and not found
anywhere within the created world. Ibn Taymiyya also regards this as
the plain witness of revelation, as in the Qur&rsquo;anic verses,
&ldquo;They fear their Lord above them&rdquo; (Q. 16:50), and
&ldquo;The All-Merciful sat over the Throne&rdquo; (Q. 20:5). He works
out the implications of God&rsquo;s spatial aboveness most fully in
<em>Explicating the Deception</em>, a refutation of Fakhr al-D&#299;n
al-R&#257;z&#299;&rsquo;s <em>Ta&#702;s&#299;s al-taqd&#299;s</em>
(<em>Establishing Sanctification</em>). According to
al-R&#257;z&#299;, God is not accessible to the senses, and God is not
spatial (<em>muta&#7717;ayyiz</em>) or subject to location
(<em>jiha</em>). God is also neither inside the world nor outside of
it. God is a non-spatial entity accessible only to the intellect.
Al-R&#257;z&#299; provides several arguments for his position, which
Ibn Taymiyya refutes in turn and thereby clarifies his own view.</p>

<p>
Al-R&#257;z&#299; argues that a God located in space would need that
space. Al-R&#257;z&#299; here adopts a Platonic conception of space
that subsists independently of the objects it contains (Adamson 2017).
A space occupying God is thus dependent on the space in which He is
located, and this impugns His self-sufficiency. Ibn Taymiyya denies
the existence of space that subsists independently of other existents.
He takes inspiration from Ibn Rushd who denies the existence of void
space and defines place (<em>mak&#257;n</em>) in Aristotelian terms as
the inner surface of the body surrounding and containing it. The place
of one celestial sphere, for example, is the inner surface of the
celestial sphere surrounding it, but the universe has no place because
it is not surrounded by anything at all, not even void space. Ibn
Taymiyya likewise affirms that there is no void space. Space
(<em>&#7717;ayyiz</em>) is the boundary of an object inside of which
the object extends and obtains. The boundaries are part of the object
and do not exist apart from it. Without the object, no space exists.
To put it differently, existents do not occupy space; instead,
existents are spatially extended (<em>muta&#7717;ayyiz</em>). So,
nothing exists except God and the world below. There is nothing above
the world except God, and there is no space above God that God could
be said to occupy.</p>

<p>
Along with <em>kal&#257;m</em> theology more generally,
al-R&#257;z&#299; contends that a spatial God would be divisible and
composite, which would violate God&rsquo;s unity. Ibn Taymiyya agrees
that God cannot be divided into parts or composed out of them, but he
does not concede that spatiality implies divisibility and composition
in the case of God. God can be both indivisible and very big. Ibn
Taymiyya affirms that God is so immense that no one can measure God
truly, but he also explains that God&rsquo;s size is finite because an
infinite spatial extension is impossible.</p>

<p>
Al-R&#257;z&#299; argues furthermore that a God located above in a
spatial sense would lie above people standing on one side of the
spherical earth but below those on the opposite side, which is absurd.
Ibn Taymiyya replies that the sky is above the earth no matter where
one stands on the earth. Likewise, God is always located above from
any point on the earth. God in fact surrounds the universe: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The Creator of all things is above all things and surrounds them from
His location that surrounds all of [the celestial spheres] (<em>an
yak&#363;na kh&#257;liq al-jam&#299;&#703; fawq al-jam&#299;&#703;
wa-mu&#7717;&#299;&#7789;an bi-hi min jihati-hi
al-mu&#7717;&#299;&#7789;a jam&#299;&#703;i-h&#257;</em>).
(<em>Bay&#257;n Talb&#299;s</em> 4: 52; trans. Hoover 2022: 664)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The notion of God&rsquo;s spatial extension easily suggests that God
is a body. Ibn Taymiyya is, however, reticent to speak of God as a
body (<em>jism</em>) because the revealed texts and the early Muslims
(<em>salaf</em>) do not affirm or deny this term of God. He is also
wary of the term because <em>kal&#257;m</em> theologians understand
the very definition of &ldquo;body&rdquo; to involve divisibility and
composition. Yet, Ibn Taymiyya does allow calling God a body so long
as it is completely clear that God is indivisible.</p>

<p>
To sum up Ibn Taymiyya&rsquo;s views on God and space, God is a huge
indivisible, spatially extended existent that surrounds the entire
universe. God is not an existent in space, nor does God transcend
space. Rather, God is spatial in God&rsquo;s essence. There is no void
space, and no space exists apart from God and the universe that God
has created (Holtzman 2018: 457&ndash;63; Suleiman 2019: 119&ndash;25;
Hoover 2022).</p>

<h3 id="GodCreaTime">4.4 God, Creation and Time</h3>

<p>
According to Ibn Taymiyya, God&rsquo;s perfection entails perpetual
dynamism and not timeless eternity as in <em>kal&#257;m</em> theology
and Avicennan philosophy. Ibn Taymiyya&rsquo;s understanding of time,
much like his interpretation of space, is Aristotelian in tenor. God
does not transcend time, but God does not exist within time either.
Rather, time derives from God&rsquo;s internal dynamism and
God&rsquo;s perpetual creation of the world. Furthermore, there has
always been time. The genus of time is eternal because God has been
doing one thing after another from eternity. However, time does not
subsist as an eternal entity independently of God. Time has no
independent existence apart from the movement from which it derives
(Suleiman 2019: 125&ndash;8).</p>

<p>
Ibn Taymiyya&rsquo;s understanding of God&rsquo;s internal dynamism is
similar to views held earlier by the philosopher Ab&#363; Barak&#257;t
al-Baghd&#257;d&#299; (d. ca. 1165) and the Karr&#257;m&#299;
theologians who thrived in what is today Iran and Afghanistan. He also
acknowledges that his position is tantamount to what
<em>kal&#257;m</em> theologians identify as temporally originating
events (<em>&#7717;aw&#257;dith</em>) subsisting in God&rsquo;s
essence. However, Ibn Taymiyya prefers to avoid the non-scriptural
term <em>&#7717;aw&#257;dith</em> and speak instead of God&rsquo;s
dynamism in terms of God&rsquo;s voluntary attributes
(<em>al-&#7779;if&#257;t al-ikhtiy&#257;riyya</em>). God&rsquo;s
voluntary attributes include God&rsquo;s creation, love, mercy, wrath,
justice, sitting and descending. These attributes subsist in
God&rsquo;s essence, and God exercises them by means of His will and
power. Ibn Taymiyya contrasts his view with those of the
Ash&#703;ar&#299;s and Mu&#703;tazil&#299;s, taking speech as a prime
example. The Ash&#703;ar&#299;s maintain along with Ibn Taymiyya that
God&rsquo;s speech, will, and power subsist in God&rsquo;s essence,
but they insist that these attributes are timelessly eternal to avert
temporality in the essence of God. Ibn Taymiyya counters that the
Ash&#703;ar&#299;s thereby abolish the instrumentality between
God&rsquo;s will and power on the one hand and God&rsquo;s speech on
the other. They impugn God&rsquo;s perfection by making it impossible
for God to speak by means of His will and power. Additionally, Ibn
Taymiyya does not believe that it is possible to correlate a
timelessly eternal attribute of speech with temporal events in the
world. The Mu&#703;tazil&#299;s for their part do affirm that God
speaks by His will, but they seek to safeguard God&rsquo;s timeless
eternity by understanding God&rsquo;s speech to be something created
in a substrate disjoined from God&rsquo;s essence. Ibn Taymiyya
responds that such speech is no longer God&rsquo;s own because it does
not subsist within Him. For Ibn Taymiyya, the correct view, the view
of the <em>salaf</em>, is that God has been speaking by His will and
power from eternity with individual acts of speech subsisting in His
essence. These divine speech acts are not themselves eternal, but
neither are they created because created things do not subsist in the
essence of God. Ibn Taymiyya breaks the <em>kal&#257;m</em> identity
of the temporal with the created and the timelessly eternal with the
uncreated. God&rsquo;s internal dynamism is temporal in character but
not created. God&rsquo;s uncreated speech acts are temporal and can
address temporal events in the world (Hoover 2004: 296&ndash;9; Hoover
2010: 58&ndash;60; Suleiman 2019: 298&ndash;312).</p>

<p>
Creation in Ibn Taymiyya&rsquo;s theology is a voluntary attribute
like speech. God&rsquo;s perfection entails that God perpetually
create created things by His will and power from eternity without
beginning (<em>min al-azal</em>). While each created thing in the
world had a beginning and no created thing is eternal alongside God,
there has always been one created thing or another. This present world
that God created in six days was created out of prior materials that
God had created previously out of prior created things and so on <em class="la">ad
infinitum</em> into the past. Ibn Taymiyya speaks of the
genus or species of created things being eternal since there have
always been created things, but he denies that this genus as such has
an extramental existence. In a history of creation that has no
beginning and no end, only created things with beginnings exist in
extramental reality.</p>

<p>
Ibn Taymiyya&rsquo;s view of creation is closer to the philosophers
Ibn S&#299;n&#257; and Ibn Rushd than to the <em>kal&#257;m</em>
theologians. He follows both philosophers in affirming that
God&rsquo;s perfection entails the production of the world, but like
Ibn Rushd, he rejects Ibn S&#299;n&#257;&rsquo;s emanation scheme in
favor of God&rsquo;s continuous creation of the world. Ibn Taymiyya
may well have been inspired by Ibn Rushd since we know that he read
the philosopher&rsquo;s texts. Ibn Taymiyya also adopts Ibn
S&#299;n&#257;&rsquo;s and Ibn Rushd&rsquo;s criticism of the
<em>kal&#257;m</em> theologians&rsquo; account of creation <em class="la">ex
nihilo</em>. If the world had had a beginning, as the
<em>kal&#257;m</em> theologians argue, God would have been imperfect
before creating it and subject to change when He began the creation
process. A preponderator (<em>murajji&#7717;</em>) or efficient cause
would need to have arisen to cause God to start originating. The
<em>kal&#257;m</em> theologians counter that it is was in the very
nature of God&rsquo;s will to begin originating the world, and no
additional preponderator was needed to cause God to begin creating.
Ibn Taymiyya rejects this as positing something impossible, namely,
preponderance without a preponderator (Hoover 2004; Abu AbdurRahman
2023).</p>

<h3 id="CausTheo">4.5 Causality and Theodicy</h3>

<p>
Ibn Taymiyya affirms that God&rsquo;s activity is rational. God
creates on account of a cause (<em>&#703;illa</em>) or wise purpose
(<em>&#7717;ikma</em>), and, given that God has been creating from
eternity, the wise purposes of God&rsquo;s creative acts regress
infinitely into the past within God&rsquo;s essence. Moreover,
God&rsquo;s rationality is not purely altruistic. God acts for
benefits that redound not only to creatures but also to God Himself.
For Ibn Taymiyya it is neither rational nor praiseworthy for agents to
commit acts that are of no benefit to themselves. Ash&#703;ar&#299;
theologians object that a God who acts for wise purposes must be needy
and dependent on those acts to attain perfection. Ibn Taymiyya
counters that it is rational for agents to be perfected by their acts
and that it is a greater perfection to create things for wise purposes
at the right times than to create without purpose. God is
self-sufficient, not in the sense of being free to act or not act
without reason&mdash;the Ash&#703;ar&#299; view&mdash;but in needing
no help in the act of creation. Furthermore, God&rsquo;s love for the
love and obedience of His servants does not derive from God&rsquo;s
need for love. Rather, it follows on from God&rsquo;s love of
God&rsquo;s self. God&rsquo;s self-love is primary, and from
God&rsquo;s self-love flows God&rsquo;s love for human beings and the
creation of everything that they do, including their love for God and
obedience to Him. God does not act to acquire perfection. Instead,
God&rsquo;s creative acts, and with them the created world, are
necessary concomitants of the perfection of God&rsquo;s essence. Ibn
Taymiyya&rsquo;s resolution to the problem of God&rsquo;s
self-sufficiency is Neoplatonic, and the notion of God&rsquo;s
self-love giving rise to the world as a necessary concomitant is found
in the Neoplatonism of Ibn S&#299;n&#257; (Bell 1979: 71&ndash;3;
Hoover 2007: 70&ndash;102; Vasalou 2016: 167&ndash;79).</p>

<p>
Ibn Taymiyya uses the language of secondary causes (sg.
<em>sabab</em>) in instrumental and material senses to describe the
process of God&rsquo;s creation of things in the world. For example,
God creates the human act by means of the human will and power; God
makes plants grow by means of clouds and rain; and God causes illness
and death by means of poison. In general, God creates everything out
of and by means of previously existing materials and powers. Secondary
causality looks natural from the human perspective, even though God
has the power to interrupt it, but from the divine perspective, it is
purely instrumental.</p>

<p>
God&rsquo;s creation of all human acts raises the question of human
responsibility. The Mu&#703;tazlil&#299; <em>kal&#257;m</em>
theologians maintain that humans are responsible for their acts
because humans themselves create them. Ibn Taymiyya rejects the
Mu&#703;tazil&#299; formulation as compromising God&rsquo;s exclusive
creative power. Instead, in what may be earlier texts, he affirms that
humans are the agents of their acts and therefore liable to reward and
punishment because God creates their acts in them and not in Himself.
In what may be later texts, Ibn Taymiyya also roots the origin of
human moral failure in nonexistence to absolve God completely of
creating it. Humans are liable to punishment for omitting to do the
deeds that they were created to perform. This omission is a privation;
it does not exist, and so it cannot be attributed to God.</p>

<p>
As with Ibn Taymiyya&rsquo;s approach to God&rsquo;s self-sufficiency,
Avicennan Neoplatonic inclinations color his theodicy as well. God
creates all things, including evils, for wise purposes that are
ultimately good. Pure or absolute evil does not exist. Evil is only
evil relative to those afflicted by it. Ibn Taymiyya sometimes says
that God&rsquo;s wise purposes in evil cannot be known. At other
times, however, he indicates that God&rsquo;s wise purposes have to do
with nurturing religious virtues such as repentance, humility, and
patience. Ibn Taymiyya ultimately affirms that everything God creates
is good and that this world is the best of all possible worlds. To
avoid the charge that this limits God&rsquo;s power, Ibn Taymiyya
asserts that God could create other than this world. However, God
creates the world that He does out of His perfection and wise purpose
(Hoover 2007: 146&ndash;65, 177&ndash;228).</p>

<h2 id="TheoReli">5. Theory of Religion</h2>

<p>
Ibn Taymiyya&rsquo;s theory of religion (<em>d&#299;n</em>) is
decidedly naturalistic and sociological, at least in its foundations,
and, as will be noted further below, it draws on Ibn
S&#299;n&#257;&rsquo;s analysis of final causality to point to God as
religion&rsquo;s proper object of worship. For Ibn Taymiyya, humans
are dynamic and goal-oriented beings who necessarily will, love,
worship, and obey something. So, they cannot help but be religious.
Moreover, human beings are social, and every human group requires a
religion to unite it and guide it in attaining benefit and warding off
harm. Religion consists of inner and outer acts of obedience, worship,
and ethical character, and it is what people love in common to attain
mutual benefit. Religion then has two fundamental aspects: 1) the
object of love and worship and 2) the means by which that object is
loved and worshipped. The divinely revealed and most beneficial
religion is worship and love of God alone by means of the
prescriptions of Islam. Ibn Taymiyya elaborates as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Every living being must have an object of love, which is the goal of
its love and its will and towards which its inner and outer movements
are directed. That is its god. That [love, will, and movement] is of
no benefit unless it is for God alone, without giving Him an
associate. Everything other than Islam is worthless.&hellip;Every
religion, obedience, and love must have two things. The first is the
object of religion, love, and obedience. This is the object of
intention and the object of will. The second is the form of the deeds
by which [that object] is obeyed and worshipped. This is the way, the
path, the law, the method, and the means of access.&hellip;Religion
encompasses two things: the object of worship and the worship. The
object of worship is the one God. Worship is obeying Him and obeying
His Messenger. This is the religion of God with which He is well
pleased. As He said, &ldquo;I am well pleased with Islam as a religion
for you&rdquo; (Qur&#702;&#257;n 5:3). (<em>Q&#257;&#702;ida f&#299;
al-ma&#7717;abba</em> 39&ndash;40; trans. Hoover 2019b: 43&ndash;4;
see further Abbasi 2021: 64&ndash;70)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Ibn Taymiyya frequently signifies God&rsquo;s unique worthiness of
worship with the terms <em>ul&#363;hiyya</em> and
<em>il&#257;hiyya</em>. Both mean &ldquo;divinity&rdquo; in the sense
of that which is worshipped, and he compounds them with the term
<em>taw&#7717;&#299;d</em> (confessing the oneness or exclusivity of
God) to denote the act of taking God as the sole object of worship and
obedience (<em>taw&#7717;&#299;d al-ul&#363;hiyya</em> and
<em>taw&#7717;&#299;d al-il&#257;hiyya</em>). Ibn Taymiyya also uses
the terms <em>rub&#363;biyya</em> and <em>rabb&#257;niyya</em>
(lordship) to denote God&rsquo;s role as creator, sustainer, and
source. The confession that God is the one and only Lord of the
universe (<em>taw&#7717;&#299;d al-rub&#363;biyya</em> or
<em>taw&#7717;&#299;d al-rabb&#257;niyya</em>) means that God is
creator of everything that exists, all human acts included. Ibn
Taymiyya often complains that the Ash&#703;ar&#299;
<em>kal&#257;m</em> theologians give primacy to confessing the
exclusiveness of God&rsquo;s lordship (<em>taw&#7717;&#299;d
al-rub&#363;biyya</em>) and lose sight of God&rsquo;s sole right to
worship. Instead, he argues, the Qur&#702;&#257;n gives priority to
devoting worship to God alone (<em>taw&#7717;&#299;d
al-ul&#363;hiyya</em>), as in the invocation in the first chapter of
the Qur&#702;&#257;n, &ldquo;You alone we worship; You alone we ask
for help&rdquo; (Qur&#702;&#257;n 1:5). &ldquo;You alone we
worship&rdquo; comes first as an expression of <em>taw&#7717;&#299;d
al-ul&#363;hiyya</em> and is then followed by &ldquo;You alone we ask
for help&rdquo; as a confession that God is the sole source of
sustenance, an expression of <em>taw&#7717;&#299;d
al-rub&#363;biyya</em> (Hoover 2007: 26&ndash;9, 120&ndash;2; Michot
2012b: 123&ndash;68).</p>

<p>
Ibn Taymiyya further elucidates the priority of God&rsquo;s worthiness
of worship with the Aristotelian causal analysis of Ibn
S&#299;n&#257;. For Ibn S&#299;n&#257;, the final cause is the end for
which something comes into existence and the efficient cause is that
which brings the thing into existence. Additionally, the final cause
is the efficient cause of the efficient cause insofar as it motivates
the action of the efficient cause. In the following discussion of
Qur&#702;&#257;n 1:5, Ibn Taymiyya links final causality to divinity
and efficient causality to lordship and underlines the primacy of
divinity by identifying it as the efficient cause of the efficient
cause lordship.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The God (<em>al-il&#257;h</em>) is the one worshipped and asking for
help is linked to His lordship. The Lord of the servants is He who
lords over them. This entails that He is Creator of everything that is
in them and from them. The divinity is the final cause, and lordship
is the efficient cause. The final [cause] is that which is aimed at,
and it is the efficient cause of the efficient cause. Therefore, He
made &ldquo;You alone we worship&rdquo; precede &ldquo;You alone we
ask for help&rdquo;. Confessing the exclusiveness of the divinity
(<em>taw&#7717;&#299;d al-il&#257;hiyya</em>) includes confessing the
exclusiveness of the lordship (<em>taw&#7717;&#299;&#7693;
al-rub&#363;biyya</em>). Included in worshipping only God is not
confessing the lordship of any other. (<em>Bay&#257;n talb&#299;s
al-Jahmiyya</em> 4: 533, trans. Hoover 2007:28&ndash;9)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In Ibn Taymiyya&rsquo;s view, the means of worship most pleasing to
God and most beneficial to humankind is the law
(<em>shar&#299;&#703;a</em>) revealed to the Prophet Mu&#7717;ammad.
This law encompasses everything that God loves for human beings to
believe and do, and it includes religious ritual, theological
doctrines, contractual and moral obligations toward others, and
religious virtues like patience and gratitude. Ibn Taymiyya maintains
as well that the law of Islam is coextensive with justice and maximum
human benefit (<em>ma&#7779;la&#7717;a</em>) in much the same way that
he claims that reason and revelation coincide in matters of theology.
Ibn Taymiyya is as much an apologist for the rationality of the divine
law as he is for the rationality of his theological doctrines. The two
terms &ldquo;law&rdquo; and &ldquo;justice&rdquo; are for him
interchangeable, and he goes so far as to say that God will give
victory to a just state that is not Muslim over a Muslim state that is
not just. Furthermore, there is nothing outside the revealed law whose
benefit outweighs its detriment. The religious law never neglects a
benefit, and Muslim jurists who imagine that some acts not mentioned
in the law are beneficial are mistaken. Al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299; had
developed a process for authorizing unstated benefits
(<em>al-ma&#7779;&#257;li&#7717; al-mursala</em>) by identifying five
fundamental purposes of the law: the preservation of religion,
intellect, life, progeny and property. Benefits not found directly in
the revealed law may be legitimized as part of that law by aligning
them with the main purposes of the law. Ibn Taymiyya criticizes this
strategy for adding rulings to the law that God did not legislate.
Additionally, according to Ibn Taymiyya, al-Ghaz&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s
five purposes are too narrowly focused on worldly affairs, and they do
not take sufficient account of benefits found in legislated worship
rituals like the ritual prayer (<em>&#7779;al&#257;h</em>). For Ibn
Taymiyya, innovated religious rituals, like commemorating the
Prophet&rsquo;s birthday, and other acts not found within the law may
yield some benefit for those who perform them, but the detriments
always outweigh the benefits. Ibn Taymiyya therefore condemns such
acts and urges abandoning them if possible (Opwis 2010: 181&ndash;199;
Rapoport 2010; Ukeles 2010; Vasalou 2016: 197&ndash;210; Mustafa
2023).</p>

<p>
Religion for Ibn Taymiyya cannot do without temporal power, and he
criticizes two errors in this regard. One is avoiding power and wealth
so as not to sully religion with the compromises of temporal affairs,
and the other is deploying power and wealth for personal gain instead
of advancing religion. To avert these errors, Ibn Taymiyya seeks to
infuse public authority with the ethical impulses of the revealed law
in his book <em>Law-Guided Public Policy</em> (<em>al-Siy&#257;sa
al-Shar&#703;iyya</em>). The purpose of the public authorities,
whether they be political, military, judicial or scholarly, is
&ldquo;to reform the religion of the people&rdquo; in order
&ldquo;that religion is entirely for God and that the word of God is
most high&rdquo; (<em>Siy&#257;sa</em> 30, 33). Rulers are to further
the cause of religion and enable worship of God alone within whatever
political structures happen to be in place. While Ibn Taymiyya speaks
to the appointment of public officials, the distribution of public
wealth, the conduct of war, the provision of public services, and
criminal and personal status law among other things, he does not
outline a blueprint for a perfect Islamic state. He instead exhorts
public officials to work toward religious reform to the best of their
abilities within the circumstances, using force as deemed prudent
(Khan 1992: 23&ndash;64, 98&ndash;170; Johanson 2008; Anjum 2012;
Belhaj 2013; Michot 2014; Bori 2021).</p>

<h2 id="Meta">6. Metaethics</h2>

<p>
It has been observed that Ibn Taymiyya&rsquo;s ethics of God&rsquo;s
creative and commanding activity follows the utilitarian maxim of the
greatest happiness for the greatest number (Vasalou 2016: 172). This
is readily apparent in Ibn Taymiyya&rsquo;s theodicy: God continuously
produces the greatest possible benefit for the greatest number by
creating the best-of-all-possible-worlds. Ibn Taymiyya&rsquo;s
metaethical theory on the human plane mirrors this divine
utilitarianism. He rejects the moral rationalism of the
Mu&#703;tazil&#299; <em>kal&#257;m</em> theologians who argue that
acts are objectively good or bad in themselves such that God commands
an act because it is good or forbids an act because it is bad. He also
rebuffs classical Ash&#703;ar&#299; divine command theory in which the
moral values of acts are determined solely by God&rsquo;s will such
that an act is good only because God commands it. Ibn Taymiyya instead
follows the consequentialist inclinations of post-classical
Ash&#703;ar&#299;s like Fakhr al-D&#299;n al-R&#257;z&#299;. The moral
values of acts depend on the outcomes of those acts, whether they
produce pleasure or pain, benefit or detriment, profit or harm. The
goodness of an act depends on the degree to which it is advantageous
to the actor or wider society, and rational human communities should
seek to maximize their overall benefit. The role of God&rsquo;s law
then is to point humankind to what is of ultimate benefit in both this
life and the hereafter, namely, worshipping God alone according to
God&rsquo;s law (Hoover 2007: 34&ndash;9; Vasalou 2016:
11&ndash;136).</p>

<p>
Like other post-classical Muslim jurists, Ibn Taymiyya sometimes
overrides explicit legal prohibitions on the grounds of benefit and
necessity. For example, Islamic law forbids eating carrion, but Ibn
Taymiya permits eating it if necessary to avoid starvation. More
generally, Ibn Taymiyya maintains the revealed law as his guiding
ideal, but he insists that the benefits and detriments of actions must
be weighed up carefully when human weakness or sin make following the
law difficult or impossible or when the law is not fully known. His
reflection on the caliphate is a poignant example of such utilitarian
calculation. Ibn Taymiyya maintains that the &ldquo;caliphate of
prophecy&rdquo;, the normative caliphate of the first four Sunn&#299;
caliphs following the death of the Prophet Mu&#7717;ammad, is an
obligation for the Muslim community. Morally inferior
&ldquo;kingship&rdquo;, which predominated in Muslim lands after the
first four Sunn&#299; caliphs, is only permissible in case of need.
Nonetheless, Ibn Taymiyya maintains, kingship is only a minor sin, and
Muslims should weigh up the benefits and detriments in the
circumstances to attain the greatest possible benefit for religion. It
might be beneficial, for example, to indulge a king&rsquo;s wine
drinking if calling upon him to stop would lead to the greater
detriment of his apostasy from Islam. Moreover, Ibn Taymiyya explains,
such weighing up of benefits and detriments is the way of the Prophet
(Michot 2006: 14&ndash;7, 20, 50&ndash;3, 85&ndash;100; Hoover
2019a).</p>

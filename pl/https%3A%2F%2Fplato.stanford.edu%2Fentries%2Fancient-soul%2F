<h1>Ancient Theories of Soul</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Oct 23, 2003; substantive revision Wed May 15, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Ancient philosophical theories of soul are in many respects sensitive
to ways of speaking and thinking about the soul [<em>psuch&ecirc;</em>]
that are not specifically philosophical or theoretical. We therefore
begin with what the word &lsquo;soul&rsquo; meant to speakers of
Classical Greek, and what it would have been natural to think about
and associate with the soul. We then turn to various Presocratic
thinkers, and to the philosophical theories that are our primary
concern, those of Plato (first in the <em>Phaedo</em>, then in the
<em>Republic</em>), Aristotle (in the <em>De Anima</em> or <em>On the
Soul</em>), Epicurus, and the Stoics. These are by far the most
carefully worked out theories of soul in ancient philosophy. Later
theoretical developments &mdash; for instance, in the writings of
Plotinus and other Platonists, as well as the Church Fathers &mdash;
are best studied against the background of the classical theories,
from which, in large part, they derive.</p>

<p>
Adopting a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the terrain that we will be
covering, and setting many details aside for the moment, we can
describe it as follows. From comparatively humble Homeric beginnings,
the word &lsquo;soul&rsquo; undergoes quite remarkable semantic
expansion in sixth and fifth century usage. By the end of the fifth
century &mdash; the time of Socrates&rsquo; death &mdash; soul is
standardly thought and spoken of, for instance, as the distinguishing
mark of living things, as something that is the subject of emotional
states and that is responsible for planning and practical thinking,
and also as the bearer of such virtues as courage and justice. Coming
to philosophical theory, we first trace a development towards
comprehensive articulation of a very broad conception of soul,
according to which the soul is not only responsible for mental or
psychological functions like thought, perception and desire, and is
the bearer of moral qualities, but in some way or other accounts for
all the vital functions that any living organism performs. This broad
conception, which is clearly in close contact with ordinary Greek
usage by that time, finds its fullest articulation in
Aristotle&rsquo;s theory. The theories of the Hellenistic period, by
contrast, are interested more narrowly in the soul as something that
is responsible specifically for mental or psychological functions.
They either de-emphasize or sever the ordinary-language connection
between soul and life in all its functions and aspects.</p>

<h2><a name="1">1. The Greek Notion of Soul</a></h2>

<p>
The Homeric poems, with which most ancient writers can safely be
assumed to be intimately familiar, use the word &lsquo;soul&rsquo; in
two distinguishable, probably related, ways. The soul is, on the one
hand, something that is risked in battle and lost in death. On the
other hand, it is what at the time of death departs from a
person&rsquo;s limbs and travels to the underworld, where it has a
more or less pitiful afterlife as a shade or image of the deceased
person. It has been suggested (for instance, by Snell 1975, 19) that
what is referred to as soul in either case is in fact thought of as
one and the same thing, something that a person can risk and lose and
that, after death, endures as a shade in the underworld. The
suggestion is plausible, but cannot be verified. In any case, once a
person&rsquo;s soul has departed for good, the person is dead. The
presence of soul therefore distinguishes a living body from a corpse.
However, this is plainly not to say that the soul is thought of as
what accounts for, or is responsible for, the activities, responses,
operations and the like that constitute a person&rsquo;s life. Homer
never says that anyone does anything in virtue of, or with, their
soul, nor does he attribute any activity to the soul of a living
person. Thus, though the presence or absence of soul marks out a
person&rsquo;s life, it is not otherwise associated with that life.
Moreover, it is a striking feature of Homeric usage that, in
Furley&rsquo;s words (Furley 1956, 4), to mention soul is to suggest
death: someone&rsquo;s soul comes to mind only when their life is
thought, by themselves or others, to be at risk. Thus Achilles says
that he is continuously risking his soul (<em>Iliad</em> 9.322), and
Agenor reflects on the fact that even Achilles has just one soul
(<em>Iliad</em> 11.569). It should also be pointed out that in the
Homeric poems, having and losing soul is generally reserved to humans
(<em>Odyssey</em> 14.426 is an outlier; I am grateful to Gregory
Frost-Arnold for calling my attention to it). Correspondingly, Homer
never envisages shades or images of non-human creatures in the
underworld. These two facts taken together suggest that in whatever
precise way the soul is conceived of as associated with life, it is in
any case thought to be connected not so much with life in general, or
life in all its forms, as, more specifically, with the life of a human
being.</p>

<p>
Several significant developments occurred in the ways Greeks thought
and spoke about the soul in the sixth and fifth centuries. The
questions about the soul that are formulated and discussed in the
writings of Plato and Aristotle to some extent arise from, and need to
be interpreted against the background of, these sixth and fifth
century developments. One factor that is of central importance is the
gradual loss of the Homeric connection between mentioning a
person&rsquo;s soul and the thought that their life is vulnerable or
at risk (<em>contra</em> Burnet 1916, 253). In ordinary fifth century
Greek, having soul is simply being alive; hence the emergence, at
about this time, of the adjective &lsquo;ensouled&rsquo;
[<em>empsuchos</em>] as the standard word meaning &ldquo;alive&rdquo;,
which was applied not just to human beings, but to other living things
as well. There is some reason to think that the word
&lsquo;soul&rsquo; was used in this straightforwardly positive way
already in the sixth century. Thales of Miletus, who is credited with
successfully predicting a solar eclipse occurring in 585, reportedly
attributed soul to magnets, on the grounds that magnets are capable of
moving iron (Aristotle, <em>De Anima</em> 1.2, 405a19&ndash;21).
Thales&rsquo; thought was presumably that since it is distinctive of
living things to be able to initiate movement, magnets must in fact be
alive or, in other words, ensouled. Thus, while Homer spoke of soul
only in the case of human beings, in sixth and fifth century usage
soul is attributed to every kind of living thing. What is in place,
then, at this time is the notion that soul is what distinguishes that
which is alive from that which is not. </p>

<p>
However, it is not just that soul is said to be present in every
living thing. It is also the case that an increasingly broad range of
ways of acting and being acted on is attributed to the soul. Thus it
has come to be natural, by the end of the fifth century, to refer
pleasure taken in food and drink, as well as sexual desire, to the
soul. (For detailed discussion, see Claus 1981, 73&ndash;85.) People
are said, for example, to satisfy their souls with rich food
(Euripides, <em>Ion</em> 1170), and the souls of gods and men are
claimed to be subject to sexual desire (fragment assigned by Nauck to
Euripides&rsquo; first <em>Hippolytus</em>). In contexts of intense
emotion or crisis, feelings like love and hate, joy and grief, anger
and shame are associated with the soul. &ldquo;Nothing bites the soul
of a man more than dishonor&rdquo;, says Ajax in a fragment from a
tragedy of unknown authorship, just before he dies by suicide (Nauck,
<em>TGF, Adesp.</em> fr. 110). Oedipus says that his soul laments the
misery of his city and its inhabitants (<em>Oedipus Tyrannus</em> 64).
Moreover, the soul is also importantly connected with boldness and
courage, especially in battle. Courageous people are said, for
instance in Herodotus and Thucydides, to have enduring or strong souls
(cf. Laches&rsquo; second definition of the virtue that is courage, in
Plato&rsquo;s <em>Laches</em> 192c, as &ldquo;strength of the
soul&rdquo;; also relevant is Pindar, <em>Pythian</em> 1.47&ndash;8,
&ldquo;standing in battle with an enduring soul&rdquo;). In the
Hippocratic text <em>Airs, Waters, Places</em>, the soul is thought of
as the place of courage or, as the case may be, its opposite: in the
case of lowland inhabitants, courage and endurance are not in their
souls by nature, but must be instilled by law (ch. 23); similarly in
benign climates, men are fleshy, ill-jointed, moist, without endurance
and weak in soul (ch. 24). </p>

<p>
The connection between the soul and characteristics like boldness and
courage in battle is plainly an aspect of the noteworthy fifth century
development whereby the soul comes to be thought of as the source or
bearer of moral qualities such as, for instance, temperance and
justice. In Pericles&rsquo; funeral oration that Thucydides includes
in his account of the Peloponnesian War, he says that those who know
most clearly the sweet and the terrible, and yet do not as a result
turn away from danger, are rightly judged &ldquo;strongest with regard
to soul&rdquo; (2.40.3). This text, and others like it (cf. also
Herodotus 7.153), indicate a semantic extension whereby
&lsquo;soul&rsquo; comes to denote a person&rsquo;s moral character,
often, but not always, with special regard to qualities such as
endurance and courage. While the connection with courage is obvious in
a number of texts, there are other texts in which the soul is the
bearer of other admirable qualities, such as a Euripidean fragment
that speaks of the desire characteristic of a soul that is just,
temperate and good (fr. 388). Hippolytus, in Euripides&rsquo; play
named after him, describes himself as having a &ldquo;virgin
soul&rdquo; (<em>Hippolytus</em> 1006), obviously to evoke his
abstinence from sex. In Pindar&rsquo;s second Olympian, salvation is
promised to those who &ldquo;keep their souls from unjust acts&rdquo;
(2.68&ndash;70). The last two texts mentioned may well be influenced
by Orphic and Pythagorean beliefs about the nature and immortality of
the soul, to which we will turn in due course. But it would be a
mistake to think that the moralization of the soul (i.e. its
association with moral characteristics) wholly depended on Orphic and
Pythagorean speculation. It would, at the very least, be to disregard
the soul&rsquo;s connection with courage in poetry, the historians and
in Hippocratic writings.</p>

<p>
To educated fifth century speakers of Greek, it would have been
natural to think of qualities of soul as accounting for, and being
manifested in, a person&rsquo;s morally significant behavior. Pericles
acts courageously, and Hippolytus temperately (or chastely), because
of the qualities of their souls from which such actions have a strong
tendency to flow, and their actions express and make evident the
courage, temperance and the like that characterize their souls. Once
we are in a position properly to appreciate the connection between
soul and moral character that must already have been felt to be
natural at this stage, it should come as no surprise that the soul is
also taken to be something that engages in activities like thinking
and planning. If the soul is, in some sense, responsible for
courageous acts, for instance, it is only to be expected that the soul
also grasps what, in the circumstances, courage calls for, and how, at
some suitable level of detail, the courageous act must be performed.
Thus in a speech of Antiphon, the jury is urged to &ldquo;take away
from the accused the soul that planned the crime&rdquo;, in striking
juxtaposition of the ideas of life-soul (as in Homer) and of soul as
responsible for practical thought. Somewhat similarly, in a Sophoclean
fragment (fr. 97) someone says that &ldquo;a kindly soul with just
thoughts is a better inventor than any sophist&rdquo; (cf. also
Euripides, <em>Orestes</em> 1180). Moreover, it is easy to see that
there are connections between familiar uses of &lsquo;soul&rsquo; in
emotional contexts and attributions to the soul of cognitive and
intellectual activities and achievements. There is, after all, no
clear-cut and manifest difference between, say, being in the emotional
state of fear and having a terrifying thought or perception. When
Oedipus&rsquo; soul laments, or Ajax&rsquo;s soul is bitten by
dishonor, emotion obviously goes hand in hand with cognition, and if
it is natural to refer the one to the soul, there should be nothing
puzzling about attributions to it of the other. Thus in
non-philosophical Greek of the fifth century the soul is treated as
the bearer of moral qualities, and also as responsible for practical
thought and cognition. For further discussion on the contrary claims
of Burnet 1916, see: </p>

<blockquote>
 [<a href="supplement.html">Supplementary Document: Burnet on the Greek Notion of Soul</a>]
 </blockquote>

<p>
From Homer to the end of the fifth century, the word
&lsquo;soul&rsquo; undergoes remarkable semantic expansion, in the
course of which it comes to be natural not only to speak of soul as
what distinguishes the living from the dead and (not the same
distinction) the animate from the inanimate, but also to attribute to
the soul a wide variety of activities and responses, cognitive as well
as emotional, and to think of it as the bearer of such virtues as
courage, temperance and justice. As a result of these developments,
the language made available something that Homeric Greek lacked, a
distinction between body and soul. Thus the Hippocratic author of
<em>Airs, Waters, Places</em> writes of &ldquo;endurance in body and
soul&rdquo; (ch. 23). Antiphon says of a defendant who is sure of his
innocence that though his body may surrender, his soul saves him by
its willingness to struggle, through knowledge of its innocence. For
the guilty, on the other hand, even a strong body is to no avail,
since his soul fails him, &ldquo;believing the vengeance coming to him
is for his impieties&rdquo; (Antiphon 5). Homer, by contrast, knows
and speaks of a whole lot of different sources and bearers of
psychological predicates, but lacks a word to pick out the soul as a
single item to which the predicates in question can, in some way or
other, be referred and which can be distinguished from, and in
suitable contexts contrasted with, the body (cf. Snell 1975,
18&ndash;25). </p>

<h2><a name="2">2. Presocratic Thinking about the Soul</a></h2>

<p>
The semantic expansion of &lsquo;soul&rsquo; in the sixth and fifth
centuries is reflected in the philosophical writings of the period.
For instance, once it becomes natural to speak of soul as what
distinguishes the animate from the inanimate, rather than as something
that is restricted to humans, it becomes clear that the domain of
ensouled things is not limited to animals, but includes plants as
well. Empedocles and, apparently, Pythagoras (cf. Bremmer 1983, 125)
thought that plants have souls, and that human souls, for instance,
can come to animate plants. (Note, though, that Empedocles, in extant
fragments, rarely uses the word &lsquo;soul&rsquo;, preferring the
word <em>daim&ocirc;n</em>.) Empedocles in fact claimed to have been a
bush in a previous incarnation, as well as, among other things, a bird
and a fish (fr. 117, Kirk, Raven &amp; Schofield 1983 [in what follows
KR&amp;S], 417). Incidentally, Empedocles, like Anaxagoras and
Democritus, referred to plants as animals, presumably precisely
because they are alive (<em>z&ecirc;n</em>, from which the word for
animal, <em>z&ocirc;on</em>, derives) (for details, cf. Skemp 1947, 56).
In this he was followed by Plato (<em>Timaeus</em> 77b), but
emphatically not by Aristotle (<em>De Anima</em> 2.2, 413b1f).</p>

<p>
There is, moreover, some reason to think that philosophical activity,
notably Pythagorean speculation (beginning around mid-sixth century),
contributed to the semantic expansion of &lsquo;soul&rsquo;. As we
have seen, at least some of the earliest extant texts that associate
with the soul moral virtues other than courage suggest Pythagorean
influence. It is, in fact, not difficult to see how Pythagoreanism may
have furthered the expansion of &lsquo;soul&rsquo;. Pythagoreanism was
concerned with, among other things, the continued existence of the
person (or something suitably person-like) after death. It is obvious
that against the Homeric background, &lsquo;soul&rsquo; was an
eminently appropriate word to use so as to denote the person, or
quasi-person, that continued to exist after death; there was, after
all, the familiar Homeric use of &lsquo;soul&rsquo; as that which
endures in the underworld after a person&rsquo;s death. To make the
continued existence of this soul significant as the continued
existence of the person in question, at least some of the states,
activities, operations and the like that seemed crucial to the
identity of the person had to be attributed to the soul (following
Furley 1956, 11, who goes further than that, writing of the need for
the soul &ldquo;to include <em>all</em> the functions of
personality&rdquo;; cf. Barnes 1982, 103&ndash;6; Huffman 2009). This
tendency is well illustrated by a story about Pythagoras, reported by
Xenophanes (fr. 7, KR&amp;S 260): &ldquo;Once, they say, he was
passing by when a puppy was being whipped, and he took pity and said:
&lsquo;Stop, do not beat it; it is the soul of a friend that I
recognized when I heard its [i.e., the soul&rsquo;s!]
voice.&rsquo;&rdquo; It is not just that the soul of Pythagoras&rsquo;
friend accounts for the character of the yelping (or whatever).
Pythagoras is in fact quoted as saying that it is his friend&rsquo;s
soul that is doing the yelping! </p>

<p>
Heraclitus (fl. around 500 BC), who repeatedly mentions Pythagoras,
attributes wisdom to the soul provided that it is in the right state
or condition: &ldquo;a dry soul&rdquo;, he claims, &ldquo;is wisest
and best&rdquo; (fr. 118, KR&amp;S 230). He may have been the first
thinker to articulate a connection between soul and motor functions.
&ldquo;A man when he is drunk&rdquo;, Heraclitus remarks, &ldquo;is
led by an unfledged boy, stumbling and not knowing where he goes,
having his soul moist&rdquo; (fr. 117, KR&amp;S 231). On the most
plausible construal of Heraclitus&rsquo; sentence, he is saying that
the drunken person stumbles because his perceptual abilities have been
impaired, and this impairment is due to moistness of soul (Schofield
1991, 22). Like many (or indeed all) sixth and fifth century thinkers
who expressed views on the nature or constitution of the soul,
Heraclitus thought that the soul was bodily, but composed of an
unusually fine or rare kind of matter, e.g. air or fire. (A possible
exception is the Pythagorean Philolaus, who may have held that the
soul is an &lsquo;attunement&rsquo; of the body; cf. Barnes 1982,
488&ndash;95, and
 <a href="../philolaus/">Huffman</a>.)
 The prevalence of the idea that the soul is bodily explains the
absence of problems about the relation between soul and body. Soul and
body were not thought to be radically different in kind; their
difference seemed just to consist in a difference in degree of
properties such as fineness and mobility. </p>

<h2><a name="3">3. Plato&rsquo;s Theories of Soul</a></h2>

<p>
The various developments that occurred in the sixth and fifth
centuries in how Greeks thought and spoke of the soul resulted in a
very complex notion that strikes one as remarkably close to
conceptions of the soul that we find in fourth century philosophical
theories, notably Plato&rsquo;s. There is thus some reason to think
that the philosophical theories in question are best interpreted as
working with, and on, the relatively non-theoretical notion of the
soul that by the end of the fifth century has come to be embedded in
ordinary language. In what follows our main concern will be to
characterize some of the theories in question. But we should also
attend, wherever this seems appropriate and helpful, to ways in which
familiarity with the ordinary notion of the soul might enable us
better to understand why a theory or an argument proceeds the way it
does. In addition, we should note ways in which philosophical theories
might seem to clarify and further articulate the ordinary notion. We
begin with Plato, and with a question that is intimately tied up with
the ordinary notion of the soul as it developed from the Homeric poems
onwards, namely whether a person&rsquo;s soul does indeed survive the
person&rsquo;s death. </p>

<h3><a name="3.1">3.1 The <em>Phaedo&rsquo;s</em> Theory of Soul</a></h3>

<p>
It is probably true that in mainstream fifth century Greek culture,
belief in an afterlife of the soul was weak and unclear (Claus 1981,
68; Burnet 1916, 248&ndash;9). If so, it is fitting that
Socrates&rsquo; arguments for the immortality of the soul, most
prominently in the <em>Phaedo</em>, are offered to interlocutors who, at
the outset of the discussion, are by no means convinced of the idea.
(In fact, in the <em>Apology</em>, 40c, Socrates himself is presented as
being noncommittal about what happens to the soul at death, and even
about whether it survives at all.) &ldquo;Men find it very hard to
believe&rdquo;, Cebes says at <em>Phaedo</em> 70a, &ldquo;what you said
about the soul. They think that after it has left the body it no
longer exists anywhere, but that it is destroyed and dissolved on the
day the man dies.&rdquo; This view is restated by Simmias (at 77b) as
the opinion of the majority (cf. 80d); note that the view includes the
idea that the soul is a material thing, and is destroyed by being
dispersed, &ldquo;like breath or smoke&rdquo; (70a). Glaucon, in the
last book of the <em>Republic</em> (608d), is taken aback by
Socrates&rsquo; question,</p>

<blockquote>
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you realized that our soul is immortal and never
destroyed?&rdquo;

<p>
He looked at me with wonder and said: &ldquo;No, by god, I
haven&rsquo;t. Are you really in a position to assert that?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Moreover, apart from the question of immortality or otherwise, there
is the further question whether the soul, if it does have some form of
existence after the person has died, &ldquo;still possesses some power
and wisdom&rdquo; (<em>Phaedo</em>, 70b; cf. 76c). Answering both
questions, Socrates says not only that the soul is immortal, but also
that it contemplates truths after its separation from the body at the
time of death. Needless to say, none of the four main lines of
argument that Socrates avails himself of succeeds in establishing the
immortality of the soul, or in demonstrating that disembodied souls
enjoy lives of thought and intelligence (for a detailed discussion,
see Bostock 1986 and Ebrey 2023). However, the arguments do shed light
on Plato&rsquo;s conception of the soul, especially the affinity
argument (78b-80b). This argument confronts head-on the widespread
worry that the soul, at or soon after death, is destroyed by being
dispersed. It begins by distinguishing between two kinds of things: on
the one hand, things that are perceptible, composed of parts, and
subject to dissolution and destruction; on the other hand, things that
are not perceptible, but intelligible (grasped by thought), not
composed of parts, and exempt from dissolution and destruction. These
two categories are obviously mutually exclusive. It is not clear
whether or not they are meant to be exhaustive. Moreover, the category
of imperishable, intelligible being is exemplified, but not, it seems,
exhausted, by Platonic forms such as equality, beauty and the like
(<em>contra</em> Bostock 1986, 118). Intelligible being evidently
includes what Socrates calls the divine, whose nature it is to rule
and to lead (80a), and there is no indication that the forms exhaust
the divine, or even include the divine, so understood. Thus the
argument leaves room for the idea that souls are not forms, but are
nevertheless intelligible, partless and imperishable (<em>contra</em>
Robinson 1995, 29). In fact, in framing the argument in the way he
does Plato furnishes the conceptual framework needed for saying that
body and soul differ in kind, the one being perceptible and
perishable, the other being intelligible and exempt from destruction.
However, the argument does not support such a strong conclusion, and
Socrates is aware of this. </p>

<p>
What he does, in fact, conclude is that the soul is <em>most like</em>,
and <em>most akin to</em>, intelligible being, and that the body is most
like perceptible and perishable being. To say this is plainly neither
to assert nor to imply (as Robinson 1995, 30, appears to think) that
soul in some way or other falls short of intelligible, imperishable
being, any more than it is to assert or imply that body in some way or
other falls short of, or rather rises above, perceptible, perishable
being. The argument leaves it open whether soul is a perfectly
respectable member of intelligible reality, the way human bodies are
perfectly respectable members of perceptible reality, or whether,
alternatively, soul has some intermediate status in between
intelligible and perceptible being, rising above the latter, but
merely approximating to the former. Socrates does seem to take his
conclusion to imply, or at least strongly suggest, that it is natural
for the soul either &ldquo;to be altogether indissoluble, or nearly
so&rdquo;, but, in any case, that the soul is less subject to
dissolution and destruction than the body, rather than, as the popular
view has it, more so. If this position can be established, Socrates is
in a position to refute the popular view that the soul, being composed
of ethereal stuff, is <em>more</em> liable to dispersion and destruction
than the body. However, as Cebes points out (88b), unless Socrates can
establish that the soul is altogether exempt from destruction,
confidence of survival in the face of death is misplaced.
Socrates&rsquo; soul may be a great deal more durable than his body,
but as long as it is not truly imperishable, there can be no guarantee
that it will survive Socrates&rsquo; impending death. For it might
have experienced any number of incarnations already, and the current
one might be its last. So Socrates launches his most elaborate and
final argument for the immortality of the soul, which concludes that
since life belongs to soul essentially, the soul must be deathless
&mdash; that is, immortal. </p>

<p>
The affinity argument is supposed to show not only that the soul is
most like intelligible, imperishable being, but also that it is most
akin to it. Socrates argues that the soul is like intelligible being
on the grounds that it is not visible and, in general, not perceptible
(anyhow to humans, as Cebes adds at 79b), and that it shares its
natural function with the divine, namely to rule and lead (the body in
the one case, mortals in the other). There is a separate argument for
the kinship of the soul with intelligible being. When the soul makes
use of the senses and attends to perceptibles, &ldquo;it strays and is
confused and dizzy, as if it were drunk&rdquo; (79c). By contrast,
when it remains &ldquo;itself by itself&rdquo; and investigates
intelligibles, its straying comes to an end, and it achieves stability
and wisdom. It is not just that the soul is in one state or another
depending on which kind of object it is attending to, in such a way
that its state somehow corresponds to the character of the object
attended to. That would not by itself show that the soul is more akin
to the one domain rather than the other (this is the point of
Bostock&rsquo;s criticism, Bostock 1986, 119). To understand the
argument properly, it is crucial to note that when the soul attends to
perceptibles, it is negatively affected in such a way that its
functioning is at least temporarily reduced or impaired (&ldquo;dizzy,
as if drunk&rdquo;), whereas there is no such interference when it
attends to intelligibles (cf. Socrates&rsquo; fear, at 99e, that by
studying things by way of the senses he might blind his soul). The
claim that the soul is akin to intelligible reality thus rests, at
least in part, on the view that intelligible reality is especially
suited to the soul, as providing it with a domain of objects in
relation to which, and only in relation to which, it can function
without inhibition and interference and fully in accordance with its
own nature, so as to achieve its most completely developed and optimal
state, wisdom.</p>

<p>
Thus the soul, as Plato conceives of it in the <em>Phaedo</em>, is
crucially characterized by cognitive and intellectual features: it is
something that reasons, more or less well depending on the extent to
which it is disturbed or distracted by the body and the senses;
something that regulates and controls the body and its desires and
affections, &ldquo;especially if it is a wise soul&rdquo; (94b),
presumably in a way that involves, and renders effective, judgments
about what it is best to do, and how it is best to behave; and
something that has, as the kind of adornment that is truly appropriate
to it, virtues such as temperance, justice and courage (114e f.).
However, it should be clear that the soul, as it is conceived of here,
is not simply the mind, as we conceive of it. It is both broader and
narrower than that. It is broader in that Plato evidently retains the
traditional idea of soul as distinguishing the animate from the
inanimate. Two of the four main lines of argument for the immortality
of the soul rely not on cognitive or indeed specifically psychological
features of the soul, but simply on the familiar connection between
soul and life. According to the cyclical argument (70c-72d), being
alive in general is preceded by, just as it precedes, being dead.
Socrates takes this to show that a creature&rsquo;s death involves the
continued existence of the soul in question, which persists through a
period of separation from body, and then returns to animate another
body in a change which is the counterpart of the previous change,
dying. According to the last line of argument that Socrates offers in
the <em>Phaedo</em>, the soul is immortal because it has life
essentially, the way fire has heat essentially. It is plain that both
of these arguments apply to the souls of all living things, including
plants (cf. 70d, 71d). And in that final argument, Socrates explicitly
appeals to the idea that it is the soul that animates the body of a
living thing (105c): </p>

<blockquote>
What is it that, when present in a body, makes it living? &mdash; A
soul.
</blockquote>

<p>
Now, as we have seen in some detail, the Greek notion of soul included
the idea of soul as animating body probably as early as the sixth
century, when Thales attributed soul to magnets. Connections between
the soul and morally significant characteristics such as courage,
temperance and justice, and with cognitive and intellectual functions,
notably with planning and practical thought, are firmly established in
fifth century Greek usage. But it is obviously far from clear whether
the ordinary notion of soul, as it develops from the Homeric poems
down to the end of the fifth century, is a well-formed, coherent
notion, one that can suitably support the very prominent role that
Plato assigns to the soul, in the <em>Phaedo</em> as well as in other
dialogues. Perhaps most pressingly, it is far from clear whether what
distinguishes the animate from the inanimate is the very thing that,
in the case of some animate organisms, is responsible for cognitive
functions such as sense-perception and thought, and that, specifically
in the case of human beings, is the bearer of moral qualities such as
justice, courage and the like. The question is neither explicitly
raised nor, of course, resolved in the <em>Phaedo</em>; but a passage in
the <em>Republic</em> (352d-354a), with which we will be concerned in
section 3.2, suggests that Plato took the ordinary notion of soul, in
all its richness and bewildering complexity, to be well-formed and
coherent, and to be capable of supporting the requirements of his own
theory.</p>

<p>
Given the idea that soul is the distinguishing mark of all living
things, including plants, the Greek notion of soul is, as we have seen
already, broader than our concept of mind. For it is at least
conceivable, and probably true as a matter of fact, that there are
living (hence ensouled) organisms without minds, without, that is to
say, desire and cognition by sense or intellect. (Plato appears to
think that plants do have minds in this sense, because he takes them
to exhibit desire and sense-perception (<em>Timaeus</em> 77b), but that
is presumably supposed to be a matter of empirical fact or inference,
rather than simply a consequence of the fact that plants have souls.)
</p>

<p>
In another way, the conception of soul that is in evidence in the
<em>Phaedo</em> is significantly narrower than our concept of mind, in
that the soul, as conceived of in this particular dialogue, is not, in
fact, responsible, or <em>directly</em> responsible, for all of a
person&rsquo;s mental or psychological activities and responses, but
only for a rather severely limited subset of them. Socrates attributes
a large variety of mental states (etc.) not to the soul, but to the
(animate) body, such as, for instance, beliefs and pleasures (83d),
and desires and fears (94d). At the same time, the soul is not
narrowly intellectual: it too has desires (81d), even passionate ones
(such as the nonphilosophical soul&rsquo;s love [<em>er&ocirc;s</em>] of
the corporeal, 80b), and pleasures as well, such as the pleasures of
learning (114e). Moreover, the soul&rsquo;s functions are, as we have
seen already, not restricted to grasping and appreciating truth, but
prominently include regulating and controlling the body and its
affections (such as beliefs and pleasures, desires and fears), no
doubt in light of suitable judgments, arrived at, or anyhow supported
and controlled, by reasoning. The soul of the <em>Phaedo </em>in fact
seems to be precisely what in <em>Republic</em> 4 is identified as just
one part of the soul, namely reason, whereas the functions of the
lower parts, appetite and spirit, are assigned, in the psychological
framework of the <em>Phaedo</em>, to the animate body. And just as the
functions of reason (in the <em>Republic</em>) and of the soul (in the
<em>Phaedo</em>) are not restricted to cognition, but include desire and
emotion, such as desire for and pleasure in learning, so the functions
of non-rational soul (in the <em>Republic</em>) and of the body (in the
<em>Phaedo</em>) are not restricted to desire and emotion, but include
cognition, such as beliefs (presumably) about objects of desire,
&lsquo;descriptive&rsquo; or (rather) non-evaluative
(&ldquo;there&rsquo;s food over there&rdquo;) as well as
(<em>contra</em> Lovibond 1991, 49) evaluative (&ldquo;this drink is
delightful&rdquo;) (cf. <em>Phaedo</em> 83d).</p>

<p>
One somewhat surprising, and perhaps puzzling, feature of the
<em>Phaedo</em> framework is this. On the one hand, Socrates evidently
takes the soul to be in some way responsible for the life of any
living organism, and hence presumably for <em>all</em> the various
activities (etc.) that constitute, or are crucially involved in, any
organism&rsquo;s life. On the other hand, he also takes it that there
is a restricted class of activities that the soul is responsible for
<em>in some special way</em>, such that it is not actually the case that
the soul is responsible in this special way for all of the relevant
activities that living organisms engage in. Thus, given the idea that
the soul is responsible, in some way or other, for all the life of any
living organism, one would certainly expect it to be responsible, in
some way or other, for (say) the desires, emotions and beliefs of
organisms whose lives include such psychological states &mdash; and
not just for some restricted subset of these desires, emotions and
beliefs, but in fact for all of them. However, Socrates&rsquo;
attribution to the soul of all and only desires, emotions and beliefs
<em>of reason</em> (to use the <em>Republic</em> framework) is actually
quite compatible with the view that the soul is responsible for all
the life-activities organisms engage in, including, of course, the
desires (etc.) of what in the <em>Republic</em> framework is the
non-rational soul. What Socrates needs is something that can certainly
be supplied, some suitable articulation of the different ways in which
the soul can be said to be responsible for relevant activities of a
living organism. One such way is that to be capable of engaging in the
activity in question at all, an organism has to be ensouled, perhaps
ensouled in a certain way (for instance, in the way animals are rather
than in the way plants are). Another (stronger) way in which the soul
can be responsible for an activity is <em>directly</em>: rather than
being the thing in virtue of which the organism can do or undergo
something or other (for instance, becoming thirsty and forming the
desire to drink on that basis), the soul can also perform activities
in its own right (for instance, contemplating mathematical truths).
So, to restate somewhat more clearly: the <em>Phaedo</em>&rsquo;s
conception of soul is narrower than our concept of mind in the
following way. The range of activities (etc.) that the soul is
directly responsible for, and which may be described as activities of
the soul strictly speaking, is significantly narrower than the range
of mental activities. It does not include all of a person&rsquo;s
desires, nor need it include all emotional responses, or even all
beliefs. One plainly could not have (for instance)
&lsquo;bodily&rsquo; desires such as hunger and thirst without being
ensouled, but that does not mean that it must be the soul itself that
forms or sustains such desires. </p>

<p>
Once we properly understand the <em>Phaedo</em>&rsquo;s theory of soul,
then, we are in a position to see that it offers a psychological
framework that is coherent, though far from fully articulated. But we
should also note that the theory is somewhat unsatisfactory, in that
it appears rather strikingly to fail to do justice to the unity of the
mind. The various activities (etc.) that we characterize as mental or
psychological, such as (most importantly) desire and cognition, seem
to be, or manifest themselves to us as being, the activities of a
single integrated subject; they do not (ordinarily) appear to belong
to a plurality of distinct items that operate more or less separately
from one another. When Socrates&rsquo; contemplation of mathematical
truths is disrupted by an intense desire for food, it does not seem to
be the case that it is one thing (say, his soul) that has been doing
the contemplating and another thing (say, his body) that now wants to
get something to eat. It is rather that both contemplation and desire
to eat seem to belong to one integrated subject, regardless of whether
we wish to say that the subject in question is Socrates&rsquo; mind,
or whether we prefer to say that it is Socrates insofar as he has a
mind (or something like that). As things are, the psychological theory
of the <em>Phaedo</em> assigns Socrates&rsquo; contemplation directly to
his soul, but leaves his desire for food curiously remote from it,
apparently taking &lsquo;bodily&rsquo; desire (for instance) to be
related to the soul in much the same way in which the operations
involved in (say) metabolism and growth are so related. (Those too
take place only because his body is ensouled.) It is plausible, though
not certain, that Plato felt the force of this problem. It is, in any
case, resolved by the new theory of soul that the <em>Republic</em>
presents. </p>

<h3><a name="3.2">3.2 The <em>Republic</em>&rsquo;s Theory of Soul</a></h3>

<p>
The <em>Phaedo</em> was also known to ancient readers as Plato&rsquo;s
<em>On the Soul</em>, whereas the <em>Republic</em> has <em>On Justice</em>
as an alternative ancient title. Plato, however, conceives of justice
as the excellent state of the soul, and so it is not surprising that
the <em>Republic</em> sheds a great deal of light on Plato&rsquo;s
conception of the soul. One way in which it does so is by explicitly
integrating a number of central features of the ordinary notion of
soul, features which, in the <em>Phaedo</em>, coexist somewhat uneasily:
namely, responsibility for the life of an organism (that is, in the
human case, responsibility for its being and remaining alive as a
human being), for cognitive and (especially) intellectual functions,
and for moral virtues such as courage and justice. Towards the end of
<em>Republic</em> 1, Socrates offers Thrasymachus an elaborate argument
for the conclusion that &ldquo;injustice is never more profitable than
justice&rdquo; (354a). If we set aside, as irrelevant to the
dialectical context, the possibility that injustice and justice are
<em>equally</em> profitable, it is clear that the conclusion here is
equivalent to the position that the <em>Republic</em> is designed to
establish, in response to Glaucon&rsquo;s request, at the beginning of
Book 2, to be convinced by Socrates &ldquo;that it is better in every
way to be just than to be unjust&rdquo; (357a). The argument at the
end of Book 1 proceeds by attempting to prove an interim conclusion
that is unnecessarily strong, namely that the just person is happy,
whereas the unjust person is wretched. To establish the desired
conclusion, it is enough to prove that the just person is always
<em>happier</em> than the unjust person, which, unlike the unnecessarily
strong interim conclusion, is compatible with the view that justice is
not sufficient for (fully completed) happiness, since that requires
suitable external circumstances in addition to justice. Nothing in
Socrates&rsquo; long answer to Glaucon (and Adeimantus) commits him to
the view that justice is sufficient for (complete) happiness (cf.
Irwin 1999). However, that view is not implied by the conception of
the soul that Socrates relies on in this (Book 1) argument. Moreover,
nothing in the <em>Republic</em> contradicts or modifies this conception
of the soul (on the contrary: cf. 445a9f., 609b f.), and so there is
no reason not to take it seriously as a contribution to Plato&rsquo;s
on-going reflection on the soul, even though the argument that
surrounds it is designed to support a conclusion that Socrates
subsequently succeeds in avoiding. </p>

<p>
The argument begins with the premise that things perform their
function well if they have the virtue appropriate to them, and badly
if they have the relevant vice (353c). It then attributes to the soul
the function of &ldquo;caring for things, ruling and deliberating (and
all the things of this kind)&rdquo;, and adds that <em>living</em> is
also part of the function of soul (353d). This yields an interim
conclusion, that a good soul cares, rules, deliberates (etc.) and
lives well, whereas a bad soul does these things badly. A third
premise is that justice is the virtue appropriate to the soul,
injustice being its vice. Hence another interim conclusion: a just
soul lives well; an unjust one, badly. But living well, says the next
premise, is being happy (and living badly is being wretched). And so
Socrates can draw the interim conclusion that we have encountered
already, which is that the just person (the person, that is, whose
soul is just) is happy, whereas the person whose soul is unjust is
wretched.</p>

<p>
We make nonsense of the argument if we suppose (with Robinson 1995,
36) that when Socrates introduces <em>living</em> as part of the
function of soul, he has <em>being alive</em> in mind. The idea of being
good (or bad) at being alive is, obviously, very odd, as is the idea
of being alive well or badly. But there is no need to suppose that
such ideas are involved here, or that Socrates passes from one sense
of &lsquo;living&rsquo; [<em>to z&ecirc;n</em>] to another. It is, after
all, open to us to interpret what Socrates is saying in terms of a
conception that integrates the things that Socrates attributes to the
soul as functions, or as parts or aspects of its function, namely in
terms of the conception of living a life, and not just any kind of
life, but a distinctively human one. Caring for the right sorts of
things in the right way, ruling or regulating oneself and (when
appropriate) others, and deliberating about how to act are not just
necessary, but central aspects of living a human life, and all of
these things can be done well or badly. Depending on the condition of
their soul, a person can be better or worse at doing these things. The
just person, whose soul is in the best condition, is truly excellent
at living a human life, in that they are excellent at doing the
various things that are importantly involved in leading a
distinctively human life. If this is along the right lines, we might
be in a position to see Plato&rsquo;s answer to the question how it
can be that one thing, the soul, accounts for the life of an organism
as well as for its cognitive and intellectual functions, and is also
the bearer of virtues or excellences. The answer suggested by the Book
1 argument is this. The way in which the human soul accounts for the
life of a human organism is by accounting for the distinctively human
life that the individual in question leads. But to account for such a
life, it must also account for the cognitive and intellectual
functions which guide and shape such a life. Moreover, the dramatic
differences in how good people are at leading lives, and relatedly the
dramatic differences in how well they exercise their cognitive and
intellectual functions, are due to differences in the conditions of
their souls, namely the presence or absence of the virtues of justice,
wisdom, courage and temperance. This answer significantly clarifies
(the relevant aspects of) the ordinary Greek notion of soul (see
section 1).</p>

<p>
The <em>Republic</em> also puts forward a new theory of soul, which
involves the claim that the embodied human soul has (at least) three
parts or aspects, namely reason, spirit and appetite. The argument for
this claim is presented in Book 4, and proceeds in roughly the
following way. Socrates begins by enunciating a principle to the
effect that opposite actions, affections and states cannot be assigned
to one thing in respect of the same part of it, in relation to the
same object and at the same time. It is then agreed that desiring and
being averse are opposites, and hence that desiring to do something
and being averse to doing that same thing are opposites in relation to
the same object. But it does frequently happen, Socrates points out
and Glaucon agrees, that the soul desires to do something and at the
same time is averse to doing that same thing. This happens, for
instance, when a person is thirsty and on that basis wants to drink,
but at the same time wishes not to drink, on the basis of some
calculation or deliberation, and in fact succeeds in refraining from
drinking, thirsty though they are. It follows from the premises stated
that the human soul includes at least two distinct subjects, so that
one opposite (the desire to drink) can be assigned to one of them and
the other (the aversion to drinking) can be assigned to the other.
Taking himself to have identified reason and appetite as distinct
parts of the soul, Socrates draws attention to other kinds of conflict
between desires, which are meant to bring to light spirit, the third
part of the soul. </p>

<p>
The <em>Republic</em> contains a great deal of information that we can
rely on in characterizing the three parts of the soul that Socrates
introduces, information that can be found not only in Book 4 itself,
but also (among other places) in the catalogue of corrupt forms of
city and soul in Books 8 and 9. Here is an outline of what emerges.
Reason is the part of the soul that is, of its own nature, attached to
knowledge and truth. It is also, however, concerned to guide and
regulate the life that it is, or anyhow should be, in charge of,
ideally in a way that is informed by wisdom and that takes into
consideration the concerns both of each of the three parts separately
and of the soul as a whole (442c); these concerns must be supposed to
include a person&rsquo;s bodily needs, presumably <em>via</em> the
concerns of appetite. The natural attachment of spirit is to honor
and, more generally, to recognition and esteem by others (581a). As a
motivating force it generally accounts for self-assertion and
ambition. When its desires are frustrated, it gives rise to emotional
responses such as anger and indignation, and to behavior that
expresses and naturally flows from such responses. Socrates takes
spirit to be a natural ally of reason, at least part of its function
being to support reason in such conflicts as may arise between it and
appetite (440ef, 442ab). To assign it this function is neither to say
nor to imply that spirit cannot, in the case of a corrupt and
de-natured soul, turn against reason, even if well brought-up
individuals like Glaucon are not familiar with such corruption either
in their own case or in the case of others (440b). (<em>Pace</em>
Robinson 1995, 45, who thinks Socrates is contradicting himself here.)
Appetite is primarily concerned with food, drink and sex (439d, 580e).
It gives rise to desires for these and other such things which in each
case are based, simply and immediately, on the thought that obtaining
the relevant object of desire is, or would be, pleasant. Socrates also
calls appetite the wealth-loving part, because, in the case of mature
human beings at least, appetite also tends to be strongly attached to
wealth, given that it is most of all by means of wealth that its
primary desires are fulfilled (580e-581a). The idea must be that given
suitable habituation and acculturation in the context of a life lived
in human society, appetite tends to become attached to wealth in such
a way that it begins to give rise to desires for wealth which in each
case are based, simply and immediately, on the thought that obtaining
wealth is, or would be, pleasant; and this idea is natural and
plausible enough. (Irwin 1995 &amp; Price 1995, 57&ndash;67, offer an
alternative and incompatible interpretation.)</p>

<p>
Viewed from the perspective of the theory of soul presented in the
<em>Phaedo</em>, the <em>Republic</em> theory involves not so much a
division of soul as an integration into soul of mental or
psychological functions that had been assigned, somewhat
problematically, to the body. In both dialogues, Socrates appeals to
the same <em>Odyssey</em> passage (<em>Od</em>. 20.17&ndash;18 at
<em>Phaedo</em> 94d, <em>Od</em>. 20.17 at <em>Republic</em> 4, 441b), in
which Odysseus prevails over his own anger: in the <em>Phaedo</em>, to
exemplify a conflict between soul and body; in the <em>Republic</em>, to
exemplify a conflict between two parts or aspects of the soul, reason
and spirit. What the <em>Republic</em> offers is a theory of soul which,
among other things, allows attribution of (in principle) all mental or
psychological functions to a single subject, the soul. The theory thus
respects the unity of the mind, in a way that the <em>Phaedo</em> theory
does not. Moreover, the <em>Republic</em> theory also offers an
attractive and well-supported articulation of desire into different
kinds, which has profound implications both for what it is to have
one&rsquo;s soul (or mind) in optimal condition and for how it is that
this condition is best brought about. (To see that Plato is acutely
aware of these implications, one only needs to look at what the
<em>Republic</em> has to say about virtue and education.) However, it
may be worth insisting once more that we should not disregard the fact
that the conception of the soul that features in the <em>Republic</em>
is broader than our concept of mind, in that it continues to be part
of this conception that it is soul that accounts for the life of the
relevant ensouled organism. But if it is soul that accounts for the
life of, say, human organisms, there must be some sense in which the
human soul accounts not only for mental functions like thought and
desire, but also for other vital functions such as the activities and
operations of the nutritive and reproductive systems. To the extent
that it leaves unclear how exactly it is that the soul is related to a
broad range of activities (etc.) that are crucially involved in the
lives of ensouled organisms, Plato&rsquo;s theory of the soul, in the
<em>Republic</em> and beyond, remains incompletely developed. It is, of
course, not surprising that the <em>Republic</em> does not confront the
question how it is that the soul is related to life-functions that, as
Aristotle recognizes (<em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> 1.13,
1102b11&ndash;2), are irrelevant to the ethical and political concerns
of the <em>Republic</em>. However, context and subject matter impose no
such constraints on the &lsquo;plausible myth&rsquo; of the
<em>Timaeus</em>, and also that dialogue, in presenting a somewhat
revised version of the <em>Republic</em>&rsquo;s account (<em>Tim</em>.
69c ff.), fails to address the question how the soul is related to
non-mental vital functions.</p>

<h2><a name="4">4. Aristotle&rsquo;s Theory of Soul</a></h2>

<p>
Aristotle&rsquo;s theory, as it is presented primarily in the <em>De
Anima</em> (for a complete account, see
 <a href="../aristotle-psychology/">Aristotle&rsquo;s Psychology</a>),
 comes very close to providing a comprehensive, fully developed
account of the soul in all its aspects and functions, an account that
articulates the ways in which all of the vital functions of all
animate organisms are related to the soul. In doing so, the theory
comes very close to offering a comprehensive answer to a question that
arises from the ordinary Greek notion of soul, namely how precisely it
is that the soul, which is agreed to be in some way or other
responsible for a variety of things living creatures (especially
humans) do and experience, also is the distinguishing mark of the
animate. According to Aristotle&rsquo;s theory, a soul is a particular
kind of nature, a principle that accounts for change and rest in the
particular case of living bodies, i.e. plants, nonhuman animals and
human beings. The relation between soul and body, on Aristotle&rsquo;s
view, is also an instance of the more general relation between form
and matter: thus an ensouled, living body is a particular kind of
in-formed matter. Slightly simplifying things by limiting ourselves to
the sublunary world (cf. <em>De Anima</em> 2.2, 413a32; 2.3, 415a9), we
can describe the theory as furnishing a unified explanatory framework
within which all vital functions alike, from metabolism to reasoning,
are treated as functions performed by natural organisms of suitable
structure and complexity. The soul of an animate organism, in this
framework, is nothing other than its system of active abilities to
perform the vital functions that organisms of its kind naturally
perform, so that when an organism engages in the relevant activities
(e.g., nutrition, movement or thought) it does so in virtue of the
system of abilities that is its soul. </p>

<p>
Given that the soul is, according to Aristotle&rsquo;s theory, a
system of abilities possessed and manifested by animate bodies of
suitable structure, it is clear that the soul is, according to
Aristotle, not itself a body or a corporeal thing. Thus Aristotle
agrees with the <em>Phaedo</em>&rsquo;s claim that souls are very
different from bodies. Moreover, Aristotle seems to think that all the
abilities that are constitutive of the souls of plants, beasts and
humans are such that their exercise involves and requires bodily parts
and organs. This is obviously so with, for instance, the abilities for
movement in respect of place (e.g., by walking or flying), and for
sense-perception, which requires sense-organs. Aristotle does not,
however, think that there is an organ of thought, and so he also does
not think that the exercise of the ability to think involves the use
of a bodily part or organ that exists specifically for this use.
Nevertheless, he does seem to take the view that the activity of the
human intellect always involves some activity of the perceptual
apparatus, and hence requires the presence, and proper arrangement, of
suitable bodily parts and organs; for he seems to think that sensory
impressions [<em>phantasmata</em>] are somehow involved in every
occurrent act of thought, at least as far as human beings are
concerned (<em>De Anima</em> 3.7, 431a14&ndash;7; 3.8, 432a7&ndash;10;
cf. <em>De Memoria</em> 1, 449b31ff.). If so, Aristotle in fact seems to
be committed to the view that, contrary to the Platonic position, even
human souls are not capable of existence and (perhaps as importantly)
activity apart from the body (cf. <em>De Anima</em> 1.1, 403a3&ndash;25,
esp. 5&ndash;16). (Cohoe 2022 offers a different, and incompatible,
view.)</p>

<p>
It is noteworthy that Aristotle&rsquo;s theory does not mark off those
vital functions that are mental by relating them to the soul in some
special way that differs from and goes beyond the way in which vital
functions in general are so related. It is certainly not part of
Aristotle&rsquo;s theory that the soul is specially and directly
responsible for mental functions by performing them on its own,
whereas it is less directly responsible for the performance by the
living organism of other vital functions such as growth. As this
aspect of his theory suggests, Aristotle is confident that once one
has a proper understanding of how to explain natural phenomena in
general, there is no reason to suppose that mental functions like
perception, desire and at least some forms of thinking cannot be
explained simply by appealing to the principles in terms of which
natural phenomena in general are properly understood and explained
(cf. Frede 1992, 97).</p>

<p>
It might be thought that since Aristotle&rsquo;s theory treats mental
functions and other vital functions exactly alike, it obscures a
crucial distinction. This worry, however, turns out to be unjustified.
The theory treats mental and other vital functions alike only in that
it views both kinds of functions as performed by natural organisms of
the right kind of structure and complexity. Viewing mental and other
vital functions in this way is perfectly compatible with introducing a
distinction between mental and other functions if concerns of some
kind or other call for such a distinction. Aristotle is perfectly
capable, for instance, of setting aside non-mental vital functions as
irrelevant for the purposes of practical philosophy (<em>NE</em> 1.13,
1102b11&ndash;12).</p>

<h2><a name="5">5. Hellenistic Theories of Soul</a></h2>

<p>
Coming from the theories of Plato and Aristotle, the first thing that
might strike us about the theories of soul adopted by the two dominant
Hellenistic schools, Epicurus&rsquo; Garden and the Stoa, is the
doctrine, shared by both, that the soul is corporeal. A number of
Stoic arguments for the claim that the soul is a body have come down
to us (see Annas 1992, 39&ndash;41). The best one of these is that the
soul is a body because (roughly) only bodies affect one another, and
soul and body do affect one another, for instance in cases of bodily
damage and emotion. Epicurus employs the same argument in his
<em>Letter to Herodotus</em>, which provides an outline of his physical
doctrines (Long &amp; Sedley 1987 [in what follows L&amp;S] 14A7). In
a way that reminds one of Presocratic theories, both Epicurus and the
Stoics hold that the soul is a particularly fine kind of body,
diffused all the way through the perceptible (flesh-and-blood) body of
the animate organism. As if echoing the view of the soul that Simmias
in the <em>Phaedo</em> presents as the majority view, Epicurus thinks
that the soul is dispersed at death along with its constituent atoms,
losing the powers that it has while it is contained by the body of the
organism that it ensouls (L&amp;S 14A6). The Stoics agree that the
human soul is mortal, but they also take it that it can and does
survive the person&rsquo;s death &mdash; that is, its separation from
the perceptible body. Chrysippus apparently thought that the souls of
wise persons persist (as fine, imperceptible corporeal structures) all
the way to the next conflagration in the cosmic cycle, whereas the
souls of other people last for some time, and then get dispersed
(Diogenes Laertius 7.157; cf. L&amp;S 53W). Thus Chrysippus can
accept, at least for the souls of the wise, Socrates&rsquo; claim in
the <em>Phaedo</em> that the soul is &ldquo;altogether indissoluble,
<em>or nearly so</em>&rdquo; (<em>Phaedo</em> 80b), even though he plainly
cannot accept all of Socrates&rsquo; argument for this claim. </p>

<h3><a name="5.1">5.1 Epicurus&rsquo; Theory of Soul</a></h3>

<p>
Epicurus is an atomist, and in accordance with his atomism he takes
the soul, like everything else that there is except for the void, to
be ultimately composed of atoms. Our sources are somewhat unclear as
to exactly which kinds of materials he took to be involved in the
composition of soul. It is very probable, though, that in addition to
some relatively familiar materials &mdash; such as fire-like and
wind-like stuffs, or rather the atoms making up such stuffs &mdash;
the soul, on Epicurus&rsquo; view, also includes, in fact as a key
ingredient, atoms of a nameless kind of substance, which is
responsible for sense-perception. Thus it seems that while he thought
he could explain phenomena such as the heat or warmth of a living
organism, as well as its movement and rest, by appealing to relatively
familiar materials and their relatively familiar properties, he did
feel the need to introduce a mysterious additional kind of substance
so as to be able to explain sense-perception, apparently on the
grounds that &ldquo;sense-perception is found in none of the named
elements&rdquo; (L&amp;S 14C). It is worth noting that it is
specifically with regard to sense-perception that Epicurus thinks the
introduction of a further, nameless kind of substance is called for,
rather than, for instance, with regard to intellectual cognition. What
this suggests, and what in fact we have independent reason to think,
is that on Epicurus&rsquo; view, once one is in a position adequately
to explain sense-perception, one will then also be in a position to
work out an explanation of intellectual cognition, by appropriately
extending the explanation of sense-perception. Let us consider briefly
how such extension might work. </p>

<p>
Perceptual beliefs, like the belief that &lsquo;there is a horse over
there&rsquo;, will be explained, in Epicurus&rsquo; theory, in terms
of sense-impressions and the application of concepts
(&lsquo;preconceptions&rsquo;; for discussion cf. Asmis 1999,
276&ndash;83), and concept-formation is in turn explained in terms of
sense-impression and memory. According to Diogenes Laertius&rsquo;
summary (L&amp;S 17E1&ndash;2), the Epicureans say that </p>

<blockquote>
preconception is, as it were, cognition or correct belief or
conception or universal &lsquo;stored notion&rsquo; (i.e. memory), of
that which has frequently become evident externally: e.g.
&lsquo;such-and-such a kind of thing is a man&rsquo;. For as soon as
the word &lsquo;man&rsquo; is uttered, immediately its impression also
comes to mind by means of preconception, as a result of antecedent
sense-perceptions.
</blockquote>

<p>
Moreover, sense-impressions, interpreted and articulated in terms of
concepts or preconceptions, yield experience concerning evident
matters, which in turn forms the basis for conclusions about
non-evident matters. For example, extensive experience can make clear
to one not only that the human beings one has interacted with have a
certain feature (say, rationality), but also (later Epicureans will
say, probably somewhat developing Epicurus&rsquo; position) that it is
inconceivable that any human being could fail to have that feature
(cf. L&amp;S 18F4&ndash;5). And so, experience will not only make one
expect, with a very great deal of confidence, that any human being one
will ever encounter anywhere will be rational. Experience also,
according to the Epicureans, supports the inference to, and hence
justifies one in accepting, the (non-evident) conclusion that all
human beings, everywhere and at all times, are rational (for detailed
discussion, cf. Allen 2001, 194&ndash;241). This obviously is an
extremely generous view of what experience, and ultimately
sense-perception, can do! Once we recognize the enormously powerful
and fundamental role Epicurus and his followers assign to
sense-perception, we will not be surprised to see that they feel the
need to include in the composition of the soul a very special kind of
material that accounts specifically for sense-perception, but
apparently do not think that, in addition to that, some further
special material is needed to enable intellectual or rational
activity. </p>

<p>
In the Epicurean tradition the word &lsquo;soul&rsquo; is sometimes
used in the broad traditional way, as what animates living things
(e.g., Diogenes of Oenoanda, fr. 37 Smith), but the focus of interest,
so far as the soul is concerned, is very much on the mental functions
of cognition, emotion and desire. A view that is common in the
tradition and that very probably goes back to the founder is that the
soul is a composite of two parts, one rational, the other nonrational.
The rational part, which Lucretius calls mind [<em>animus</em>], is the
origin of emotion and impulse, and it is also where (no doubt among
other operations) concepts are applied and beliefs formed, and where
evidence is assessed and inferences are made. The nonrational part of
the soul, which in Lucretius is somewhat confusingly called soul
[<em>anima</em>], is responsible for receiving sense-impressions, all of
which are true according to Epicurus. Error arises at a later stage,
when sense-impressions are interpreted by the rational part of the
soul, in a way that, as we have seen, crucially involves memory.
Sense-perception, conceived of simply as the reception of
sense-impressions by the nonrational soul, does not involve memory
(cf. L&amp;S 16B1). Since the formation and application of concepts
requires memory, sense-perception, so conceived of, does not involve
conceptualization, either. The nonrational part is also responsible
for transmitting impulses originating from the rational part, as well
as (presumably) for a wide variety of other vital functions. (When
Epicurus distinguishes between pleasures and pains of the soul and
those of the body, incidentally, the distinction he has in mind must
be between the rational part of the soul on the one hand and the body
animated by nonrational soul, on the other.) </p>

<h3><a name="5.2">5.2 The Stoic Theory of Soul</a></h3>

<p>
Stoic physics allows for three different kinds of <em>pneuma</em> (lit.
&lsquo;breath&rsquo;), a breath-like material compound of two of the
four Stoic elements, fire and air. The kinds of <em>pneuma</em> differ
both in degree of tension that results from the expanding and
contracting effects, respectively, of its two constituents, and in
their consequent functionality. The lowest kind accounts for the
cohesion and character of inanimate bodies (e.g., rocks); the
intermediate kind, called natural <em>pneuma</em>, accounts for the
vital functions characteristic of plant life; and the third kind is
soul, which accounts for the reception and use of impressions (or
representations) (<em>phantasiai</em>) and impulse (<em>horm&ecirc;</em>:
that which generates animal movement) or, to use alternative
terminology, cognition and desire. Our evidence, which unfortunately
is fragmentary and often unclear, suggests strongly that according to
the Stoic theory, the body of an animal (human or non-human) contains
<em>pneuma</em> of all the three kinds, with the lowest kind responsible
for the cohesion and character of parts like teeth and bones, natural
<em>pneuma</em> in charge of metabolism, growth and the like, and
finally soul accounting for distinctively mental or psychological
functions, crucially cognition, by sense and (in the case of humans)
intellect, and desire (cf. Long 1999, 564, for discussion and
references). If this is indeed the picture that the theory presents,
the soul is no longer responsible for all vital functions, and for all
aspects of life, but only for specifically mental or psychological
functions. (Accordingly, the Stoics depart from the Platonic and
Aristotelian view that plants are ensouled organisms.) At the same
time, the Stoic theory does attempt to explain non-mental vital
functions as well, in terms of the activity of &lsquo;nature&rsquo;,
the intermediate kind of <em>pneuma</em>. In severing the deeply
entrenched, Greek ordinary-language connection between soul and life
in all its forms, the Stoic theory is taking an enormously momentous
step, one that obviously restricts rather dramatically the proper
subject matter of a theory of soul. In fact it is arguable that the
Stoics, in limiting the functions of soul in the way they did, played
an important role in a complicated history that resulted in the
Cartesian conception of mind, according to which the mind plainly is
not something that animates living bodies. This narrowing of the
conception of soul is one of two aspects of the Stoic theory that, for
our purposes, deserve particular notice. </p>

<p>
The second noteworthy aspect is the insistence of the Stoic theory
that the mind of an adult human being is a single, partless item that
is rational all the way down. According to the Stoic theory, there are
eight parts of the soul, the &lsquo;commanding faculty&rsquo;
[<em>h&ecirc;gemonikon</em>] or mind, the five senses, voice and
(certain aspects of) reproduction. The mind, which is located at the
heart, is a center that controls the other soul-parts as well as the
body, and that receives and processes information supplied by the
subordinate parts. The minds of non-human animals and of non-adult
humans have faculties only of impression and impulse. Achieving
adulthood, for humans, involves gaining assent and reason. Reason (it
would seem) makes assent possible, in that it enables the subject to
assent to or withhold assent from impressions, and it transforms mere
impressions and mere impulses, such as other animals experience, into
rational impressions and rational impulses. The rationality of an
impression (for example, of a tree one sees before oneself) consists
in its being articulated in terms of concepts, possession of which is
constitutive of having reason; the rationality of an impulse consists
in the fact that it is generated or constituted by a voluntary act of
assent of the mind to a suitable practical (&lsquo;impulsive&rsquo;)
impression &mdash; the impression, for instance, that something within
view would be nice to eat. Thus, depending on the type of impression
assented to, assent generates or constitutes belief (or knowledge)
concerning some matter of fact, or an impulse to act in some way or
other.</p>

<p>
It is crucially important not to misunderstand these various faculties
as parts or aspects of the mind, items that operate with some degree
of autonomy from one another and can therefore conflict. On the Stoic
theory, the faculties of the mind are simply abilities to do things.
Moreover, it is a central part of the theory that, in the case of an
adult human being, there is no such thing as an impulse without an act
of assent of the mind to a corresponding practical impression. In a
rational subject, the faculty of impulse depends on the faculty of
assent, which, like all faculties of such a subject, is a rational
faculty. This theory leaves no room for the Platonic conception that
the souls of adult human beings contain non-rational parts which can,
and frequently do, generate impulse and behavior independently of, and
even contrary to, the designs and purposes of reason. Nor, relatedly,
does it leave room for the shared Platonic and Aristotelian view that
desire, even in the case of adult humans, comes in three forms, two of
which are such that desires of these forms do not arise from, or
depend on, activities of reason. The Stoic theory has the attractive
consequence that each adult person is, through their own reasoned
assent, unambiguously and equally responsible for all their voluntary
behavior: there are no Platonic nonrational parts, or
Platonic-Aristotelian nonrational desires, that could produce actions
against one&rsquo;s own reason&rsquo;s helpless protestations.
However, the theory needed to be defended both against rival
philosophical theories and against pre-theoretical intuitions that
militate in favor of these theories. One such intuition is that
passion can, and frequently does, conflict with reason. To judge from
a report by Plutarch, it appears that the Stoics were able to explain
away this particular intuition, and also to disarm the argument for
tripartition of the soul in <em>Republic</em> 4, which depends on the
<em>simultaneity</em> of a desire for and an aversion to one and the
same thing. According to Plutarch (L&amp;S 65G1),</p>

<blockquote>
Some people [the Stoics] say that passion is no different from reason,
and that there is no dissension and conflict between the two, but a
turning of the single reason in both directions, which we do not
notice owing to the sharpness and speed of the change.
</blockquote>

<p>
Introducing the idea of unnoticed oscillation of a single, partless
mind is highly ingenious and must have been dialectically effective at
least to some extent. However, the theory of the soul that we find in
classical Stoicism appears to be committed to the view that in the
case of adult humans, there simply are no motivational factors that do
not depend on reason and that can significantly affect, often for the
worse, how a person behaves and how their life goes. It must have been
difficult to defend this view against the Platonic-Aristotelian
position. And so it is not surprising that in an environment in which
interest in Plato&rsquo;s and Aristotle&rsquo;s writings was on the
rise again, at least one prominent Stoic philosopher, Posidonius
(first century B.C.), apparently gave up at least part of the
classical Stoic theory. The evidence that we have is not easy to
interpret, but it very much appears that Posidonius introduced into a
basically Stoic psychological framework the idea that even the minds
of adult humans include, to put things cautiously, motivationally
relevant forces (of two kinds) that do not depend on assent or reason
at all and that are not fully subject to rational control. (For
detailed discussion, cf. Cooper 1998, 77&ndash;111; Lorenz 2011)</p>

<h2><a name="6">6. Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>
Ancient philosophy did not, of course, end with classical Stoicism, or
indeed with the Hellenistic period, and neither did ancient theorizing
about the soul. The revival of interest in the works of both Plato and
Aristotle beginning in the second half of the second century B.C.
prominently included renewed interest in Platonic and Aristotelian
conceptions of the soul, sparking novel theoretical developments, such
as, for instance, Plotinus&rsquo; argument (directed in particular
against the Stoics) that the soul could not be spatially extended,
since no spatially extended item could account for the unity of the
subject of sense-perception (see Emilsson 1991). Christian writers
such as Clement of Alexandria and Gregory of Nyssa were heavily
indebted to philosophical theories of soul, especially Platonic ones,
but also introduced new concerns and interests of their own.
Nevertheless, these and other post-classical developments in every
case need to be interpreted within the framework and context furnished
by the classical theories that we have been considering in some
detail.</p>

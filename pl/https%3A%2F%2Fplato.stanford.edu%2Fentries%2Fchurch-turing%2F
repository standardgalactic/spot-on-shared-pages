<h1>The Church-Turing Thesis</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Jan 8, 1997; substantive revision Mon Dec 18, 2023</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The Church-Turing thesis (or Turing-Church thesis) is a fundamental
claim in the theory of computability. It was advanced independently by
Church and Turing in the mid 1930s. There are various equivalent
formulations of the thesis. A common one is that every effective
computation can be carried out by a Turing machine (i.e., by
Turing&rsquo;s abstract computing machine, which in its universal form
encapsulates the fundamental logical principles of the stored-program
all-purpose digital computer). Modern reimaginings of the
Church-Turing thesis transform it, extending it to fundamental
physics, complexity theory, exotic algorithms, and cognitive science.
It is important to be aware though that some of the theses nowadays
referred to as the Church-Turing thesis are at best <em>very</em>
distant relatives of the thesis advanced by Church and Turing.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="ThesHist">1. The 1936 Thesis and its Context</h2>

<p>
The Church-Turing thesis concerns the concept of an <em>effective</em>
or <em>systematic</em> or <em>mechanical</em> method, as used in
logic, mathematics and computer science. &ldquo;Effective&rdquo; and
its synonyms &ldquo;systematic&rdquo; and &ldquo;mechanical&rdquo; are
terms of art in these disciplines: they do not carry their everyday
meaning. A method, or procedure, \(M\), for achieving some desired
result is called &ldquo;effective&rdquo; (or &ldquo;systematic&rdquo;
or &ldquo;mechanical&rdquo;) just in case:</p>

<ol start="1" type="1">

<li>\(M\) is set out in terms of a finite number of exact instructions
(each instruction being expressed by means of a finite number of
symbols);</li>

<li>\(M\) will, if carried out without error, produce the desired
result in a finite number of steps;</li>

<li>\(M\) can (in practice or in principle) be carried out by a human
being unaided by any machinery except paper and pencil;</li>

<li>\(M\) demands no insight, intuition, or ingenuity, on the part of
the human being carrying out the method.</li>
</ol>

<p>
A well-known example of an effective method is the truth-table test
for tautologousness. In principle, a human being who works by rote
could apply this test successfully to any formula of the propositional
calculus&mdash;given sufficient time, tenacity, paper, and pencils
(although in practice the test is unworkable for any formula
containing more than a few propositional variables).</p>

<h3 id="NoteTerm">1.1 Note on terminology</h3>

<p>
Statements that there is an effective method for achieving
such-and-such a result are commonly expressed by saying that there is
an effective method for obtaining the values of such-and-such a
mathematical <em>function</em>.</p>

<p>
For example, that there is an effective method for determining whether
or not any given formula of the propositional calculus is a tautology
(such as the truth-table method) is expressed in function-speak by
saying there is an effective method for obtaining the values of a
function, call it \(T\), whose domain is the set of formulae of the
propositional calculus and whose value for any given formula \(x\),
written \(T(x)\), is 1 or 0 according to whether \(x\) is, or is not,
a tautology.</p>

<h3 id="MakiInfoConcEffeMethPrec">1.2 Making the informal concept of an effective method precise</h3>

<p>
The notion of an effective method or procedure is an informal one, and
attempts to characterize effectiveness, such as the above, lack rigor,
for the key requirement that the method must demand no insight,
intuition or ingenuity is left unexplicated.</p>

<p>
One of Alan Turing&rsquo;s achievements, in his famous paper of 1936,
was to present a formally exact predicate with which the informal
predicate &ldquo;can be done by means of an effective method&rdquo;
may be replaced (Turing 1936). Alonzo Church, working independently,
did the same (Church 1936a).</p>

<p>
The replacement predicates that Church and Turing proposed were, on
the face of it, very different from one another. However, these
predicates turned out to be <em>equivalent</em>, in the sense that
each picks out the same set (call it \(S\)) of mathematical functions.
The Church-Turing thesis is the assertion that this set \(S\) contains
<em>every</em> function whose values can be obtained by a method or
procedure satisfying the above conditions for effectiveness.</p>

<p>
Since it can also be shown that there are no functions in \(S\)
<em>other than</em> ones whose values can be obtained by a method
satisfying the above conditions for effectiveness, the Church-Turing
thesis licenses replacing the informal claim &ldquo;There is an
effective method for obtaining the values of function \(f\)&rdquo; by
the formal claim &ldquo;\(f\) is a member of \(S\)&rdquo;&mdash;or by
any other formal claim equivalent to this one.</p>

<p>
When the Church-Turing thesis is expressed in terms of the replacement
concept proposed by Turing, it is appropriate to refer to the thesis
also as &ldquo;Turing&rsquo;s thesis&rdquo;; and as
&ldquo;Church&rsquo;s thesis&rdquo; when expressed in terms of one or
another of the formal replacements proposed by Church.</p>

<p>
The formal concept proposed by Turing was that of <em>computability by
Turing machine</em>. He argued for the claim&mdash;Turing&rsquo;s
thesis&mdash;that whenever there is an effective method for obtaining
the values of a mathematical function, the function can be computed by
a Turing machine.</p>

<p>
The converse claim&mdash;amounting to the claim mentioned above, that
there are no functions in \(S\) <em>other than</em> ones whose values
can be obtained by an effective method&mdash;is easily established,
since a Turing machine program is itself a specification of an
effective method. Without exercising any insight, intuition, or
ingenuity, a human being can work through the instructions in the
program and carry out the required operations.</p>

<p>
If Turing&rsquo;s thesis is correct, then talk about the existence and
non-existence of effective methods and procedures can be replaced
throughout mathematics, logic and computer science by talk about the
existence or non-existence of Turing machine programs.</p>

<p>
Turing stated his thesis in numerous places, with varying degrees of
rigor. The following formulation is one of the most accessible:</p>

<blockquote id="turingsthesis">

<p>
<strong>Turing&rsquo;s thesis</strong>:
<br />
L.C.M.s [logical computing machines: Turing&rsquo;s expression for
Turing machines] can do anything that could be described as
&ldquo;rule of thumb&rdquo; or &ldquo;purely mechanical&rdquo;.
(Turing 1948 [2004: 414])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He adds:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
This is sufficiently well established that it is now agreed amongst
logicians that &ldquo;calculable by means of an L.C.M.&rdquo; is the
correct accurate rendering of such phrases. (Ibid.)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="FormTuriThesTermNumb">1.3 Formulations of Turing&rsquo;s thesis in terms of numbers</h3>

<p>
In his 1936 paper, which he titled &ldquo;On Computable Numbers, with
an Application to the <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em>&rdquo;, Turing wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Although the subject of this paper is ostensibly the computable
numbers, it is almost equally easy to define and investigate
computable functions &hellip; I have chosen the computable numbers for
explicit treatment as involving the least cumbrous technique. (1936
[2004: 58])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Computable numbers are (real) numbers whose decimal representation can
be generated progressively, digit by digit, by a Turing machine.
Examples are:</p>

<ul>

<li>any number whose decimal representation consists of a finite
number of digits (e.g., 109, 1.142)</li>

<li>all rational numbers, such as one-third, two-sevenths, etc.</li>

<li>some irrational real numbers, such as &pi; and e.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some real numbers, though, are <em>un</em>computable, as Turing
proved. Turing&rsquo;s proof pointed to specific examples of
uncomputable real numbers, but it is easy to see in a general way that
there <em>must</em> be real numbers that cannot be computed by any
Turing machine, since there are <em>more</em> real numbers than there
are Turing-machine programs. There can be no more Turing-machine
programs than there are whole numbers, since the programs can be
counted: 1<sup>st</sup> program, 2<sup>nd</sup> program, and so on;
but, as Cantor proved in 1874, there are vastly more real numbers than
whole numbers (Cantor 1874).</p>

<p>
As Turing said, &ldquo;it is almost equally easy to define and
investigate computable functions&rdquo;: There is, in a certain sense,
little difference between a computable number and a computable
function. For example, the computable number .14159&hellip; (formed of
the digits following the decimal point in &pi;, 3.14159&hellip;)
corresponds to the computable function: \(f(1) = 1,\)&nbsp;\(f(2) =
4,\) \(f(3) = 1,\)&nbsp;\(f(4) = 5,\)&nbsp;\(f(5) = 9,\)&hellip; .</p>

<p>
As well as formulations of Turing&rsquo;s thesis like the one given
above, Turing also formulated his thesis in terms of numbers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[T]he &ldquo;computable numbers&rdquo; include all numbers which would
naturally be regarded as computable. (Turing 1936 [2004: 58])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
and</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is my contention that these operations [the operations of an
L.C.M.] include all those which are used in the computation of a
number. (Turing 1936 [2004: 60])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the first of these two formulations, Turing is stating that every
number which is able to be calculated by an effective method (that is,
&ldquo;all numbers which would naturally be regarded as
computable&rdquo;) is included among the numbers whose decimal
representations can be written out progressively by one or another
Turing machine. In the second, Turing is saying that the operations of
a Turing machine include all those that a human mathematician needs to
use when calculating a number by means of an effective method.</p>

<h3 id="MeanCompCompTuriThes">1.4 The meaning of &ldquo;computable&rdquo; and &ldquo;computation&rdquo; in Turing&rsquo;s thesis</h3>

<p>
Turing introduced his machines with the intention of providing an
idealized description of a certain human activity, the tedious one of
<em>numerical computation</em>. Until the advent of automatic
computing machines, this was the occupation of many thousands of
people in business, government, and research establishments. These
human rote-workers were in fact called &ldquo;computers&rdquo;. Human
computers used effective methods to carry out some aspects of the work
nowadays done by electronic computers. The Church-Turing thesis is
about computation <em>as this term was used in 1936</em>, viz. human
computation (to read more on this, turn to
 <a href="#SomeKeyRemaTuriChur">Section 7</a>).</p>
 
<p>
For instance, when Turing says that the operations of an L.C.M.
include all those needed &ldquo;in the computation of a number&rdquo;,
he means &ldquo;in the computation of a number by a human
being&rdquo;, since that is what computation was in those days.
Similarly, &ldquo;numbers which would naturally be regarded as
computable&rdquo; are numbers that would be regarded as being
computable by a human computer, a human being who is working solely in
accordance with an effective method.</p>

<h3 id="ChurThes">1.5 Church&rsquo;s thesis</h3>

<p>
Where Turing used the term &ldquo;purely mechanical&rdquo;, Church
used &ldquo;effectively calculable&rdquo; to indicate that there is an
effective method for obtaining the values of the function; and where
Turing offered an analysis in terms of computability by an L.C.M.,
Church gave two alternative analyses, one in terms of the concept of
<em>recursion</em> and the other in terms of
<em>lambda-definability</em> (&lambda;-definability). He proposed that
we</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
define the notion &hellip; of an effectively calculable function of
positive integers by identifying it with the notion of a recursive
function of positive integers (or of a &lambda;-definable function of
positive integers). (Church 1936a: 356)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The concept of a &lambda;-definable function was due to Church and
Kleene, with contributions also by Rosser (Church 1932, 1933, 1935c,
1936a; Church &amp; Rosser 1936; Kleene 1934, 1935a,b, 1936a,b; Kleene
&amp; Rosser 1935; Rosser 1935a,b). A function is said to be
&lambda;-definable if the values of the function can be obtained by a
certain process of repeated substitution. The concept of a recursive
function had emerged over time through the work of, among others,
Grassmann, Peirce, Dedekind, Peano, Skolem, Hilbert&mdash;and his
&ldquo;assistants&rdquo; Ackermann and Bernays&mdash;Sudan,
P&eacute;ter (n&eacute;e Politzer), Herbrand, Kleene, and
pre-eminently G&ouml;del (G&ouml;del 1931, 1934). The class of
&lambda;-definable functions (of positive integers) and the class of
recursive functions (of positive integers) are identical; this was
proved by Church and Kleene (Church 1936a; Kleene 1936a,b).</p>

<p>
When Turing learned of Church&rsquo;s 1936 proposal to identify
effectiveness with &lambda;-definability (while preparing his own
paper for publication), he quickly established that the concept of
&lambda;-definability and his concept of computability are equivalent
(by proving the &ldquo;theorem that all &hellip; &lambda;-definable
sequences &hellip; are computable&rdquo; and its converse; Turing 1936
[2004: 88ff]). Thus, in Church&rsquo;s proposal, the words
&ldquo;&lambda;-definable function of positive integers&rdquo; (and
equally the words &ldquo;recursive function of positive
integers&rdquo;) can be replaced by &ldquo;function of positive
integers that is computable by Turing machine&rdquo;. What Turing
proved is called an <em>equivalence result</em>. There is further
discussion of equivalence results in
 <a href="#InduEquiArgu">Section 4.1</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Post referred to Church&rsquo;s identification of effective
calculability with recursiveness and &lambda;-definability as a
&ldquo;working hypothesis&rdquo;, and he quite properly criticized
Church for masking this hypothesis as a <em>definition</em>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[T]o mask this identification under a definition &hellip; blinds us to
the need of its continual verification. (Post 1936: 105)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This, then, is the &ldquo;working hypothesis&rdquo; that, in effect,
Church proposed:</p>

<blockquote id="churchsthesis">

<p>
<strong>Church&rsquo;s thesis</strong>:
<br />
A function of positive integers is effectively calculable only if
&lambda;-definable (or, equivalently, recursive).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The reverse implication, that every &lambda;-definable function of
positive integers is effectively calculable, is commonly referred to
as <em>the converse of Church&rsquo;s thesis,</em> although Church
himself did not so distinguish (bundling both theses together in his
&ldquo;definition&rdquo;).</p>

<p>
If attention is restricted to functions of positive integers,
Church&rsquo;s thesis and Turing&rsquo;s thesis are
<em>extensionally</em> equivalent. &ldquo;Extensionally
equivalent&rdquo; means that the two theses are about one and the same
class of functions: In view of the previously mentioned results by
Church, Kleene and Turing, the class of &lambda;-definable functions
(of positive integers) is identical to the class of recursive
functions (of positive integers) and to the class of computable
functions (of positive integers). Notice, though, that while the two
theses are equivalent in this sense, they nevertheless have distinct
<em>meanings</em> and so are two <em>different</em> theses. One
important difference between the two is that Turing&rsquo;s thesis
concerns <em>computing machines</em>, whereas Church&rsquo;s does
not.</p>

<p>
Concerning the origin of the terms &ldquo;Church&rsquo;s thesis&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Turing&rsquo;s thesis&rdquo;, Kleene seems to have been the
first to use the word &ldquo;thesis&rdquo; in this connection: In
1952, he introduced the name &ldquo;Church&rsquo;s thesis&rdquo; for
the proposition that every effectively calculable function (on the
natural numbers) is recursive (Kleene 1952: 300, 301, 317). The term
&ldquo;Church-Turing thesis&rdquo; also seems to have originated with
Kleene&mdash;with a flourish of bias in favor of his mentor
Church:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
So Turing&rsquo;s and Church&rsquo;s theses are equivalent. We shall
usually refer to them both as <em>Church&rsquo;s thesis</em>, or in
connection with that one of its &hellip; versions which deals with
&ldquo;Turing machines&rdquo; as the <em>Church-Turing thesis</em>.
(Kleene 1967: 232)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Some prefer the name <em>Turing-Church thesis</em>.</p>

<h3 id="CompTuriChurAppr">1.6 Comparing the Turing and Church approaches</h3>

<p>
One way in which Turing&rsquo;s and Church&rsquo;s approaches differed
was that Turing&rsquo;s concerns were rather more general than
Church&rsquo;s, in that (as just mentioned) Church considered only
functions of positive integers, whereas Turing described his work as
encompassing &ldquo;computable functions of an integral variable or a
real or computable variable, computable predicates, and so
forth&rdquo; (1936 [2004: 58]). Turing intended to pursue the theory
of computable functions of a real variable in a subsequent paper, but
in fact did not do so.</p>

<p>
A greater difference lay in the profound significance of
Turing&rsquo;s approach for the emerging science of automatic
computation. Church&rsquo;s approach did not mention computing
machinery, whereas Turing&rsquo;s introduced the &ldquo;Turing
machine&rdquo; (as Church dubbed it in his 1937a review of
Turing&rsquo;s 1936 paper). Turing&rsquo;s paper also introduced what
he called the &ldquo;universal computing machine&rdquo;. Now known as
the universal Turing machine, this is Turing&rsquo;s all-purpose
computing machine. The universal machine is able to emulate the
behavior of any single-purpose Turing machine, i.e., any Turing
machine set up to solve one particular problem. The universal machine
does this by means of storing a description of the other machine on
its tape, in the form of a finite list of instructions (a computer
program, in modern terms). By following suitable instructions, the
universal machine can carry out any and every effective procedure,
assuming Turing&rsquo;s thesis is true. The functional parts of the
abstract universal machine are:</p>

<ol type="1">

<li>the memory in which instructions and data are stored, and</li>

<li>the instruction-reading-and-obeying control mechanism.</li>
</ol>

<p>
In that respect, the universal Turing machine is a bare-bones logical
model of almost every modern electronic digital computer.</p>

<p>
In his review of Turing&rsquo;s work, Church noted an advantage of
Turing&rsquo;s analysis of effectiveness over his own:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
computability by a Turing machine &hellip; has the advantage of making
the identification with effectiveness in the ordinary (not explicitly
defined) sense evident immediately. (Church 1937a: 43)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He also said that Turing&rsquo;s analysis has &ldquo;a more immediate
intuitive appeal&rdquo; than his own (Church 1941: 41).</p>

<p>
G&ouml;del found Turing&rsquo;s analysis superior to Church&rsquo;s.
Kleene related that G&ouml;del was unpersuaded by Church&rsquo;s
thesis until he saw Turing&rsquo;s formulation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
According to a November 29, 1935, letter from Church to me, G&ouml;del
&ldquo;regarded as thoroughly unsatisfactory&rdquo; Church&rsquo;s
proposal to use &lambda;-definability as a definition of effective
calculability. &hellip; It seems that only after Turing&rsquo;s
formulation appeared did G&ouml;del accept Church&rsquo;s thesis.
(Kleene 1981: 59, 61)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
G&ouml;del described Turing&rsquo;s analysis of computability as
&ldquo;most satisfactory&rdquo; and &ldquo;correct &hellip; beyond any
doubt&rdquo; (G&ouml;del 1951: 304 and 193?: 168). He remarked:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We had not perceived the sharp concept of mechanical procedures
sharply before Turing, who brought us to the right perspective.
(Quoted in Wang 1974: 85)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
G&ouml;del also said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The resulting definition of the concept of mechanical by the sharp
concept of &ldquo;performable by a Turing machine&rdquo; is both
correct and unique. (Quoted in Wang 1996: 203)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Moreover it is absolutely impossible that anybody who understands the
question and knows Turing&rsquo;s definition should decide for a
different concept. (Ibid.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Even the modest young Turing agreed that his analysis was
&ldquo;possibly more convincing&rdquo; than Church&rsquo;s (Turing
1937: 153).</p>

<h3 id="Ents">1.7 The <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em></h3>

<p>
Both Turing and Church introduced their respective versions of the
Church-Turing thesis in the course of attacking the so-called
<em>Entscheidungsproblem</em>. As already mentioned, the title of
Turing&rsquo;s 1936 paper included &ldquo;with an Application to the
<em>Entscheidungsproblem</em>&rdquo;, and Church went with simply &ldquo;A Note
on the <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em>&rdquo; for the title of his 1936 paper.
So&mdash;what is the <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em>?</p>

<p>
The German word &ldquo;<em>Entscheidungsproblem</em>&rdquo; means <em>decision
problem</em>. The <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> for a logical calculus is the
problem of devising an effective method for deciding whether or not a
given formula&mdash;any formula&mdash;is provable in the calculus.
(Here &ldquo;provable&rdquo; means that the formula can be derived,
step by logical step, from the axioms and definitions of the calculus,
using only the rules of the calculus.) For example, if such a method
for the classical propositional calculus is used to test the formula
\(A \rightarrow A\) (\(A\) implies \(A\)), the output will be
&ldquo;Yes, provable&rdquo;, and if the contradiction \(A \amp \neg
A\) is tested, the output will be &ldquo;Not provable&rdquo;. Such a
method is called a <em>decision method</em> or <em>decision
procedure</em>.</p>

<p>
Church and Turing took on the <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> for a fundamentally
important logical system called the (first-order) <em>functional
calculus</em>. The functional calculus consists of standard
propositional logic plus standard quantifier logic. The functional
calculus is also known as the <em>classical predicate calculus</em>
and as <em>quantification theory</em> (and Church sometimes used the
German term <em>engere Funktionenkalk&uuml;l</em>). They each arrived
at the same negative result, arguing on the basis of the Church-Turing
thesis that, in the case of the functional calculus, the
<em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> is <em>unsolvable</em>&mdash;there can be
<em>no</em> decision method for the calculus. The two discovered this
result independently of one another, both publishing it in 1936
(Church a few months earlier than Turing). Church&rsquo;s proof, which
made no reference to computing machines, is for that reason sometimes
considered to be of less interest than Turing&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>
The <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> had attracted some of the finest minds of
early twentieth-century mathematical logic, including G&ouml;del,
Herbrand, Post, Ramsey, and Hilbert and his assistants Ackermann,
Behmann, Bernays, and Sch&ouml;nfinkel. Herbrand described the
<em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> as &ldquo;the most general problem of
mathematics&rdquo; (Herbrand 1931b: 187). But it was Hilbert who had
brought the <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> for the functional calculus into the
limelight. In 1928, he and Ackermann called it &ldquo;das Hauptproblem
der mathematischen Logik&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the main problem of
mathematical logic&rdquo; (Hilbert &amp; Ackermann 1928: 77).</p>

<p>
Hilbert knew that the propositional calculus (which is a fragment of
the functional calculus) is decidable, having found with Bernays a
decision procedure based on what are called &ldquo;normal forms&rdquo;
(Bernays 1918; Behmann 1922; Hilbert &amp; Ackermann 1928: 9&ndash;12;
Zach 1999), and he also knew from the work of L&ouml;wenheim that the
<em>monadic</em> functional calculus is decidable (L&ouml;wenheim
1915). (The monadic functional calculus is the fragment involving only
one-place predicates&mdash;i.e., no relations, such as &ldquo;=&rdquo;
and &ldquo;&lt;&rdquo;, and no higher-place predicates, such as
&ldquo;&ndash; is between &ndash; and &ndash;&rdquo;.) He thought
there must be a decision procedure for the entire functional calculus.
The challenge, the main problem of mathematical logic, was to find it.
As he and Ackermann wrote in 1928, in their famous book
<em>Grundz&uuml;ge der Theoretischen Logik</em> (Principles of
Mathematical Logic):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[I]t is to be expected that a systematic, so to speak computational
treatment of the logical formulae is possible &hellip;. (Hilbert &amp;
Ackermann 1928: 72)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
However, their expectations were frustrated by the Church-Turing
result of 1936. Hilbert and Ackermann excised the quoted statement
from a revised edition of their book. Published in 1938, the new
edition was considerably watered down to take account of
Turing&rsquo;s and Church&rsquo;s monumental result.</p>

<p>
Hilbert knew, of course, that some mathematical problems have
<em>no</em> solution, for example the problem of finding a finite
binary numeral \(n\) (or unary numeral, in Hilbert&rsquo;s version of
the problem) such that \(n^2 = 2\) (Hilbert 1926: 179). He was
nevertheless very fond of saying that <em>every mathematical problem
can be solved</em>, and by this he meant that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
every definite mathematical problem must necessarily be susceptible of
an exact settlement, either in the form of an actual answer to the
question asked, or by the proof of the impossibility of its solution
and therewith the necessary failure of all attempts. (Hilbert 1900:
261 [trans. 1902: 444])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It seems never to have crossed his mind that his &ldquo;Hauptproblem
der mathematischen Logik&rdquo; falls into the second of these two
categories&mdash;until, that is, Church and Turing unexpectedly proved
&ldquo;the impossibility of its solution&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
For more detail on the <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em>, and an outline of the
stunning result that Church and Turing independently established in
1936, see the supplement on

<h2 id="BackEmerConcEffeMethDeciMeth">2. Backstory: Emergence of the concepts of <em>effective method</em> and <em>decision method</em></h2>

<p>
Effective methods are the subject matter of the Church-Turing thesis.
How did this subject matter evolve and how was it elaborated prior to
Church and Turing? This section looks back to an earlier era, after
which
 <a href="#OtheApprComp">Section 3</a>
 turns to modern developments.</p>

<h3 id="SimpRuleThumSiriBeyo">2.1 From simple rules-of-thumb to Siri and beyond</h3>

<p>
Effective methods are extremely helpful in carrying out many practical
tasks, and their use stretches back into the mists of antiquity,
although it was not until the twentieth century that interest began to
build in analysing their nature. Perhaps the earliest effective
methods to be utilized were rules-of-thumb (as Turing called them) for
arithmetical calculations of various sorts, but whatever their humble
beginnings, the scope of effective methods has widened dramatically
over the centuries. In the Middle Ages, the Catalan philosopher
 <a href="../llull/">Llull</a>
 envisaged an effective method for posing and answering questions
about the attributes of God, the nature of the soul, the nature of
goodness, and other fundamental issues. Three hundred years later, in
the seventeenth century, Hobbes was asserting that human reasoning
processes amount to nothing more than (essentially arithmetical)
effective procedures:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
By reasoning I understand computation. (Hobbes 1655 [1839]: ch. 1
sect. 2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Nowadays, effective methods&mdash;algorithms&mdash;are the basis for
every job that electronic computers do. According to some computer
scientists, advances in the design of effective methods will soon
usher in human-level artificial intelligence, followed by superhuman
intelligence. Already, virtual assistants such as Siri, Cortana and
ChatGPT implement effective methods that produce useful answers to a
wide range of questions.</p>

<p>
In its most sublimely general form, the <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> is the
problem of designing an effective general-purpose question-answerer,
an effective method that is capable of giving the correct answer, yes
or no, to <em>any</em> meaningful scientific question, and perhaps
even ethical and metaphysical questions too. The idea of such a method
is almost jaw-dropping. Llull seems to have glimpsed the concept of a
general question-answering method, writing in approximately 1300 of a
general art (&ldquo;<em>ars</em>&rdquo;), or technique, &ldquo;by
means of which one may know in regard to all natural things&rdquo;
(<em>Lo Desconhort</em>, line 8, in Llull 1986: 99). He dreamed of an
<em>ars generalis</em> (general technique) that could mechanize the
&ldquo;one general science, with its own general principles in which
the principles of other sciences would be implicit&rdquo; (Preface to
<em>Ars Generalis Ultima</em>, in Llull 1645 [1970: 1]). Llull used
circumscribed fields of knowledge to illustrate his idea of a
mechanical question-answerer, designing small domain-specific machines
consisting of superimposed discs; possibly his machines took the form
of a parchment <em>volvelle</em>, a relative of the metal
astrolabe.</p>

<p>
In early modern times, Llull&rsquo;s idea of the <em>ars
generalis</em> received a sympathetic discussion in Leibniz&rsquo;s
writings.</p>

<h3 id="Leib">2.2 Leibniz</h3>

<p>
Leibniz designed a calculating machine that he said would add,
subtract, multiply and divide, and in 1673 he demonstrated a version
of his machine in London and Paris (Leibniz 1710). His interest in
mechanical methods led him to an even grander conception, inspired in
part by Llull&rsquo;s unclear but provocative speculations about a
general-purpose question-answering mechanism. Leibniz said that Llull
&ldquo;had scraped the skin off&rdquo; this idea, but &ldquo;did not
see its inmost parts&rdquo; (Leibniz 1671 [1926: 160]). Leibniz
envisaged a method, just as mechanical as multiplication or division,
whereby</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
when there are disputes among persons, we can simply say: Let us
calculate, without further ado, in order to see who is right. (Leibniz
1685 [1951: 51])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The basis of the method, Leibniz explained, was that &ldquo;we can
represent all sorts of truths and consequences by Numbers&rdquo; and
&ldquo;then all the results of reasoning can be determined in
numerical fashion&rdquo; (Leibniz 1685 [1951: 50&ndash;51]). He hoped
the method would apply to &ldquo;Metaphysics, Physics, and
Ethics&rdquo; just as well as it did to mathematics (1685 [1951: 50]).
This conjectured method could, he thought, be implemented by what he
called a <em>machina combinatoria</em>, a combinatorial machine
(Leibniz <em>n.d.</em>1; Leibniz 1666). However, there was never much
progress towards his dreamed-of method, and in a letter two years
before his death he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[I]f I were younger or had talented young men to help me, I should
still hope to create a kind of universal symbolistic
[<em>sp&eacute;cieuse g&eacute;n&eacute;rale</em>] in which all truths
of reason would be reduced to a kind of calculus. (Leibniz 1714 [1969:
654])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In his theorizing Leibniz described what he called an <em>ars
inveniendi</em>, a discovering or devising method. The function of an
<em>ars inveniendi</em> is to produce hitherto unknown truths of
science (Leibniz 1679 [1903: 37]; Leibniz <em>n.d.</em>2 [1890: 180];
Hermes 1969). A mechanical <em>ars inveniendi</em> would generate true
statements, and with time the awaited answer to a scientific question
would arrive (Leibniz 1671 [1926: 160]). Blessed with a universal
(i.e., complete, and consistent) <em>ars inveniendi</em>, the user
could input <em>any</em> meaningful and unambiguous (scientific or
mathematical) statement \(S\), and the machine would eventually
respond (correctly) with either &ldquo;\(S\) is true&rdquo; or
&ldquo;\(S\) is false&rdquo;. As the groundbreaking developments in
1936 by Church and Turing made clear, if the <em>ars inveniendi</em>
is supposed to work by means of an effective method, then there can be
no universal <em>ars inveniendi</em>&mdash;and not even an <em>ars
inveniendi</em> that is restricted to all mathematical statements,
since these include statements of the form &ldquo;\(p\) is
provable&rdquo;, or even to all purely logical statements.</p>

<h3 id="LogiMach">2.3 Logic machines</h3>

<p>
The modern concept of a decision method for a logical calculus did not
develop until the twentieth century. But earlier logicians, including
Leibniz, certainly had the concept of a method that is
<em>mechanical</em> in the literal sense that it could be carried out
by a machine constructed from mechanical components of the sort
familiar to them&mdash;discs, pins, rods, springs, levers, pulleys,
rotating shafts, gear wheels, weights, dials, mechanical switches,
slotted plates, and so forth.</p>

<p>
In 1869, Jevons designed a pioneering machine known as the
&ldquo;logic piano&rdquo; (Jevons 1870; Barrett &amp; Connell 2005).
The name arose because of the machine&rsquo;s piano-like keyboard for
inputting logical formulae. The formulae were drawn from a syllogistic
calculus involving four positive terms, such as &ldquo;iron&rdquo; and
&ldquo;metal&rdquo; (Jevons 1870). Turing&rsquo;s colleague Mays, who
himself designed an influential electrical logic machine (Mays &amp;
Prinz 1950), described the logic piano as &ldquo;the first working
machine to perform logical inference without the intervention of human
agency&rdquo; (Mays &amp; Henry 1951: 4).</p>

<p>
The logic piano implemented a method for determining which
combinations drawn from eight terms&mdash;the four positive terms and
the corresponding four negated terms (&ldquo;non-metal&rdquo;,
etc.)&mdash;were consistent with the inputted formulae and which not
(although in fact not all consistent combinations were taken into
account). The machine displayed the consistent formulae by means of
lettered strips of wood, with upper-case letters representing positive
terms and lower-case negative. Jevons exhibited the logic piano in
Manchester at Owens College, now Manchester University, where he was
professor of logic (Mays &amp; Henry 1953: 503). His piano, Jevons
claimed with considerable exaggeration, made it &ldquo;evident that
mechanism is capable of replacing for the most part the action of
thought required in the performance of logical deduction&rdquo;
(Jevons 1870: 517).</p>

<p>
A decade later, Venn published the technique we now call <em>Venn
diagrams</em> (Venn 1880). This technique satisfies the four criteria
set out for an effective method in
 <a href="#ThesHist">Section 1</a>.
 The user first diagrams the premisses of a syllogism and then, as
Quine put it, &ldquo;we inspect the diagram to see whether the content
of the conclusion has automatically appeared in the diagram as a
result&rdquo; (Quine 1950: 74). Not all formulae of the functional
calculus are Venn-diagrammable, and Venn&rsquo;s original method is
limited to testing syllogisms. In the twentieth century, Massey showed
that Venn&rsquo;s method can be stretched to give a decision procedure
for the monadic functional calculus (Massey 1966).</p>

<p>
Venn, like Jevons, was well aware of the concept of a literally
mechanical method. He pointed out that diagrammatic methods such as
his &ldquo;readily lend themselves to mechanical performance&rdquo;
(Venn 1880: 15). Venn went on to describe what he called a
&ldquo;logical-diagram machine&rdquo;. This simple machine displayed
wooden segments corresponding to the component areas of a Venn
diagram; each wooden segment represented one of four terms. A
finger-operated release mechanism allowed any segment selected by the
user to drop downwards. This represented &ldquo;the destruction of any
class&rdquo; (1880: 18). Venn reported that he constructed this
machine, which measured &ldquo;between five and six inches square and
three inches deep&rdquo; (1880: 17). When Venn published his
description of it, Jevons quickly wrote to him saying that the
logical-diagram machine &ldquo;is exceedingly ingenious &amp; seems to
represent the relations of four terms very well&rdquo; (Jevons 1880).
Venn himself however was less enthusiastic, saying in his article
&ldquo;I have no high estimate myself of the interest or importance of
what are sometimes called logical machines&rdquo; (1880: 15). Baldwin,
commenting on Venn&rsquo;s machine in 1902, complained that it was
&ldquo;merely a more cumbersome diagram&rdquo; (1902: 29). This is
quite true&mdash;it would be at least as easy to draw the Venn diagram
on paper as to set it up on the machine. But Venn&rsquo;s article made
it very plain that the logical-diagram machine was intended to be a
hilarious send-up of Jevons&rsquo; complicated logic piano.</p>

<p>
At around the same time, Marquand&mdash;a student of
Peirce&rsquo;s&mdash;designed a logic machine which a Princeton
colleague then built (out of wood salvaged from
&ldquo;Princeton&rsquo;s oldest homestead&rdquo;, Marquand related in
his 1885). Marquand knew of Jevons&rsquo; and Venn&rsquo;s designs,
and said he had &ldquo;followed Jevons&rdquo; in certain respects, and
that his own machine was &ldquo;somewhat similar&rdquo; to
Jevons&rsquo; (Marquand 1881, 1883: 16, 1885: 303). Peirce, with
customary bluntness, called Marquand&rsquo;s machine &ldquo;a vastly
more clear-headed contrivance than that of Jevons&rdquo; (Peirce 1887:
166). Again limited to a syllogistic calculus involving only four
positive terms, Marquand&rsquo;s device, like Jevons&rsquo;, displayed
term-combinations consistent with the inputted formulae. A lettered
plate with sixteen mechanical dials was used to display the
combinations.</p>

In 1886, in a letter to Marquand, Peirce famously suggested that
Marquand consider an electrical version of his machine, and he
sketched simple switching circuits implementing (what we would now
call) an AND-gate and an OR-gate&mdash;possibly the earliest proposal
for electrical computation (Peirce 1886). Far-sightedly, Peirce wrote
in the letter that, with the use of electricity, &ldquo;it is by no
means hopeless to expect to make a machine for really very difficult
mathematical problems&rdquo;. Much later, Church discovered a detailed
diagram of an electrical relay-based form of Marquand&rsquo;s machine
among Marquand&rsquo;s papers at Princeton (reproduced in Ketner &amp;
Stewart 1984: 200). Whoever worked out the design in this
diagram&mdash;Marquand, Peirce, or an unknown third person&mdash;has a
claim to be an important early pioneer of electromechanical
computing.</p>

<p>
Peirce, with his interest in logic machines, seems to have been the
first to consider the decision problem in roughly the form in which
Turing and Church tackled it. From about 1896, he developed the
diagrammatic proof procedures he called &ldquo;existential
graphs&rdquo;. These were much more advanced than Venn&rsquo;s
diagrams. Peirce&rsquo;s system of <em>alpha-graphs</em> is a
diagrammatic formulation of the propositional calculus, and his system
of <em>beta-graphs</em> is a version of the first-order functional
calculus (Peirce 1903a; Roberts 1973). Roberts (1973) proved that the
beta-graphs system contains the axioms and rules of Quine&rsquo;s 1951
formulation of the first-order functional calculus, in which only
closed formulae are asserted (Quine 1951: 88).</p>

<p>
Peirce anticipated the concept of a decision method in his extensive
notes for a series of lectures he delivered in Boston in 1903. There
he developed a method (Peirce 1903b,c) that, if applied to any given
formula of the propositional calculus, would, he said,
&ldquo;determine&rdquo; (or &ldquo;positively ascertain&rdquo;)
whether the alpha-graphs system demonstrates that the formula is
satisfiable (is &ldquo;alpha-possible&rdquo;, in Peirce&rsquo;s
terminology), or whether, on the other hand, the system demonstrates
that it is unsatisfiable (&ldquo;alpha-impossible&rdquo;). (See the
  supplement on  <a href="decision-problem.html">The Rise and Fall of the <em>Entschedungsproblem</em></a>
 for an explanation of &ldquo;satisfiable&rdquo;.) Peirce said his
method &ldquo;is such a comprehensive routine that it would be easy to
define a machine that would perform it&rdquo;&mdash;although the
&ldquo;complexity of the case&rdquo;, he continued, &ldquo;renders any
such procedure quite impracticable&rdquo; (Peirce 1903c). Perhaps he
would not have been completely surprised to learn that within five or
six decades, and with the use of electricity, it became far from
impractical to run a decision method for the propositional calculus on
a machine.</p>

<p>
Peirce also searched&mdash;in vain, of course&mdash;for a
corresponding method for his beta-graphs system (Peirce 1903b,c,d;
Roberts 1997). Like Hilbert after him, he seems to have entertained no
doubt that full first-order predicate logic is amenable to a
machine-like method.</p>

<p>
Peirce had prescient ideas about the use of machines in mathematics
more generally. Around the turn of the century, he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[T]he whole science of higher arithmetic, with its hundreds of
marvellous theorems, has in fact been deduced from six primary
assumptions about number. The logical machines hitherto constructed
are inadequate to the performance of mathematical deductions. There
is, however, a modern Exact Logic which, although yet in its infancy,
is already far enough advanced to render it a mere question of expense
to construct a machine that would grind out all the known theorems of
arithmetic and advance that science still more rapidly than it is now
progressing. (Peirce <em>n.d.</em>, quoted in Stjernfelt 2022)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here Peirce seems to be asserting&mdash;quite correctly&mdash;that a
machine can be devised to grind out all the theorems of
Dedekind&rsquo;s (1888) axiomatisation of arithmetic (which consisted
of six &ldquo;primary assumptions&rdquo; in the form of of four axioms
and two definitions). This statement of Peirce&rsquo;s, made almost
four decades before Turing introduced Turing machines into
mathematics, was well ahead of its time.</p>

<p>
As to whether <em>all</em> mathematical reasoning can be performed by
a machine, as Leibniz seems to have thought, Peirce was fiercely
skeptical. He formulated the hypothesis that, in the future,
mathematical reasoning</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
might conceivably be left to a machine&mdash;some Babbage&rsquo;s
analytical engine or some logical machine. (Peirce 1908: 434)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
However, he placed this hypothesis alongside others he deemed
&ldquo;logical heresies&rdquo;, calling it &ldquo;malignant&rdquo;
(ibid.). His skeptical attitude, if perhaps not his reasons for it,
was arguably vindicated by Turing&rsquo;s subsequent results (Turing
1936, 1939). But before that, a quite different view of matters took
root among mathematicians, under the influence of Hilbert and his
group at G&ouml;ttingen.</p>

<h3 id="HilbGttiGrou">2.5 Hilbert and the G&ouml;ttingen group</h3>

<p>
It was largely Hilbert who first drew attention to the need for a
precise analysis of the idea of an effective decision method. In a
lecture he gave in Zurich in 1917, to the Swiss Mathematical Society,
he emphasized the need to study the concept of &ldquo;decidability by
a finite number of operations&rdquo;,
saying&mdash;accurately&mdash;that this would be &ldquo;an important
new field of research to develop&rdquo; (Hilbert 1917: 415). The
lecture considered a number of what he called &ldquo;most challenging
epistemological problems of a specifically mathematical
character&rdquo; (1917: 412). Pre-eminent among these was the
&ldquo;problem of the decidability [<em>Entscheidbarkeit</em>] of a
mathematical question&rdquo; because the problem &ldquo;touches
profoundly upon the nature of mathematical thinking&rdquo; (1917:
413).</p>

<p>
Hilbert and his G&ouml;ttingen group looked back on Leibniz as the
originator of their approach to logic and the foundations of
mathematics. Behmann, a prominent member of the group, said that
Leibniz had anticipated modern symbolic logic (Behmann 1921:
4&ndash;5). Leibniz&rsquo;s hypothesized &ldquo;universal
characteristic&rdquo; or universal symbolistic was a universal
symbolic language, in conception akin to languages used in
mathematical logic and computer science today. Hilbert and Ackermann
acknowledged Leibniz&rsquo;s influence on the first page of their
<em>Grundz&uuml;ge der Theoretischen Logik</em>, saying &ldquo;The
idea of a mathematical logic was first put into a clear form by
Leibniz&rdquo; (Hilbert &amp; Ackermann 1928: 1). Cassirer said that
in Hilbert&rsquo;s work &ldquo;the fundamental idea of Leibniz&rsquo;s
&lsquo;universal characteristic&rsquo; is taken up anew and attains a
succinct and precise expression&rdquo; (Cassirer 1929: 440). It was in
the writings of the G&ouml;ttingen group that Leibniz&rsquo;s idea of
an effective method for answering any specified mathematical or
scientific question found its fullest development (see further the
 supplement on 
 <a href="decision-problem.html">The Rise and Fall of the <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em></a>).</p>
 
<p>
Hilbert&rsquo;s earliest publication to mention what we would now call
a decision problem is his 1899 book <em>Grundlagen der Geometrie</em>
[Foundations of Geometry]. He said that in the course of his
investigations of Euclidean geometry he was</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
guided by the principle of discussing each given question in such a
way that we examined both whether it can or cannot be answered by
means of prescribed steps using certain limited resources. (Hilbert
1899: 89)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Concerning a specific example, he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Suppose a geometrical construction problem that can be carried out
with a compass is presented; we will attempt to lay down a criterion
that enables us to determine [<em>beurteilen</em>] immediately, from
the analytical nature of the problem and its solutions, whether the
construction can also be carried out using only a ruler and a
segment-transferrer. (Hilbert 1899: 85&ndash;86)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He described what would now be called an effective method for
determining this, and his term &ldquo;<em>beurteilen</em>&rdquo;
could, with a trace of anachronism, be translated as
&ldquo;decide&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Hilbert expressed the concept of a decision method more clearly the
following year, in his famous turn-of-the-century speech in Paris, to
the International Congress of Mathematicians. He presented
twenty-three unsolved problems, &ldquo;from the discussion of which an
advancement of science may be expected&rdquo;. The tenth on his list
(now known universally as Hilbert&rsquo;s Tenth Problem) was:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Given a diophantine equation with any number of unknown quantities and
with rational integral numerical coefficients: <em>To devise a process
according to which it can be determined by a finite number of
operations whether the equation is solvable in rational integers</em>.
(Hilbert 1900: 276 [trans. 1902: 458])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> was coming into even clearer focus by the
time Hilbert&rsquo;s student Behmann published a landmark article in
1922, &ldquo;Contributions to the Algebra of Logic, in particular to
the <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em>&rdquo;. It was probably Behmann who coined
the term &ldquo;<em>Entscheidungsproblem</em>&rdquo; (Mancosu &amp; Zach 2015:
166&ndash;167). In a 1921 lecture to the G&ouml;ttingen group, Behmann
said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If a logical or mathematical statement is given, the required
procedure should give complete instructions for determining whether
the statement is correct or false by a deterministic calculation after
finitely many steps. The problem thus formulated I want to call the
<em>allgemeine Entscheidungsproblem</em> [general decision problem].
(Behmann 1921: 6 [trans. 2015: 176])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Peirce, as we saw, spoke of a procedure&rsquo;s forming &ldquo;such a
comprehensive routine that it would be easy to define a machine that
would perform it&rdquo;. His work was well-known in G&ouml;ttingen:
Hilbert and Ackermann said that Peirce &ldquo;especially&rdquo;, and
also Jevons, had &ldquo;enriched the young science&rdquo; of
mathematical logic (1928: 1). Like Peirce, Behmann used the concept of
a machine to clarify the nature of the <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em>. &ldquo;It
is essential to the character&rdquo; of the problem, Behmann said,
that &ldquo;only entirely mechanical calculation according to given
instructions&rdquo; is involved. The decision whether the statement is
true or false becomes &ldquo;a mere exercise in computation&rdquo;;
there is &ldquo;an elimination of thinking in favor of mechanical
calculation&rdquo;. Behmann continued:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
One might, if one wanted to, speak of mechanical or machine-like
thinking. (Perhaps one can one day even let it be carried out by a
machine.) (Behmann 1921: 6&ndash;7 [trans. 2015: 176])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Leibniz&rsquo;s Llullian idea of a machine that could calculate the
truth was suddenly at the forefront of early twentieth century
mathematics.</p>

<h3 id="NewmCambMath">2.6 Newman and the Cambridge mathematicians</h3>

<p>
The connection Behmann emphasized between the decision problem and a
machine that carries out an &ldquo;exercise in computation&rdquo;
would soon prove crucial in Turing&rsquo;s hands. What seems to have
been Turing&rsquo;s first significant brush with the
<em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> was in 1935, in a Cambridge lecture given by
Newman. Newman, a mathematical logician and topologist, was very
familiar with the ideas emanating from G&ouml;ttingen. As early as
1923 he gave a left-field discussion of some of Hilbert&rsquo;s ideas,
himself proposing an approach to the foundations of mathematics that,
while radical and new, nevertheless had a strongly Hilbertian flavor
(Newman 1923). In 1928, Newman attended an international congress of
mathematicians in the Italian city of Bologna, where Hilbert talked
about the <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> while lecturing on his proof theory
(Hilbert 1930a; Zanichelli 1929). Hilbert&rsquo;s leading works in
mathematical logic&mdash;Hilbert and Ackermann (1928) and Hilbert and
Bernays (1934)&mdash;were both recommended reading for Newman&rsquo;s
own lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics (Smithies 1934;
Copeland and Fan 2022).</p>

<p>
Speaking in a tape-recorded interview about Turing&rsquo;s engagement
with the <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em>, Newman said &ldquo;I believe it all
started because he attended a lecture of mine on foundations of
mathematics and logic&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I think I said in the course of this lecture that what is meant by
saying that [a] process is constructive is that it&rsquo;s a purely
mechanical machine&mdash;and I may even have said, a machine can do
it.</p>

<p>
And this of course led [Turing] to the next challenge, what sort of
machine, and this inspired him to try and say what one would mean by a
perfectly general computing machine. (Newman <em>c</em>1977)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Sadly, there seems to be no record of what else Newman said at that
crucial juncture in his lecture. However, his 1923 paper &ldquo;The
Foundations of Mathematics from the Standpoint of Physics&rdquo; does
record some of his related thinking (Copeland &amp; Fan 2023). There
he introduced the term &ldquo;process&rdquo; (which he also used in
the above quotation), saying &ldquo;All logic and mathematics consist
of certain <em>processes</em>&rdquo; (1923: 12). He emphasized the
requirement that a process should <em>terminate</em> with the required
result (such as a theorem or number); and he gave a formal treatment
of processes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The properties of processes are formally developed from a set of
axioms, and a general method reached for attacking the problem of
whether a given process terminates or not. (Newman 1923: 12)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Newman did not mention the <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> in his 1923
paper&mdash;let alone moot its unsolvability (there is no evidence
that, pre-Turing, he thought the problem unsolvable)&mdash;yet, with
hindsight, he certainly laid some suggestive groundwork for an attack
on the problem. He wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The information of the first importance to be obtained about a process
or segment of a process is whether it is <em>possible</em> to perform
it&hellip;. The statement that [process] \(\Phi|\,|\alpha\rho\) is
possible means that this process <em>terminates</em>: comes to a halt
&hellip; (Newman 1923: 39)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Newman even proposed an &ldquo;apparatus&rdquo;, a &ldquo;symbolic
machine&rdquo;, for producing numbers by means of carrying out
processes of the sort he analysed, and he gave a profound discussion
of real numbers from the standpoint of this proposal (1923:
130ff).</p>

<p>
Nor was Newman the only person at Cambridge with an interest in the
<em>Entscheidungsproblem</em>. The <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> was &ldquo;in the
air&rdquo; there during the decade leading up to Turing&rsquo;s
assault on it. The Sadleirian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge,
Hardy, took an interest in the problem, inspired by von
Neumann&rsquo;s magisterial exposition and critique of Hilbert&rsquo;s
ideas (von Neumann 1927). Ackermann himself had visited Cambridge from
G&ouml;ttingen for the first half of 1925 (Zach 2003: 226). Another
visitor, Langford&mdash;who worked in Cambridge on a fellowship from
Harvard for the academic year 1924&ndash;25 (Frankena &amp; Burks
1964)&mdash;presented a series of results to the American Mathematical
Society not long after his return to Harvard, in effect solving a
number of special cases of the <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> (Langford 1926a,
1927).</p>

<p>
The Cambridge logician Ramsey, like Turing a Fellow of King&rsquo;s
College, also worked on the <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> in the latter part of
the 1920s. He died in 1930 (the year before Turing arrived in
Cambridge as an undergraduate), but not before completing a key paper
solving the <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> in special cases (Ramsey 1930). His
work, too, was prominent in the recommended reading for Newman&rsquo;s
lecture course. Braithwaite, another Fellow of King&rsquo;s College
(who had a hand in Turing&rsquo;s election to a junior research
fellowship at King&rsquo;s in 1935), was keenly interested in
Ramsey&rsquo;s work on the <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> (Copeland &amp; Fan
2022). Also in 1935, von Neumann visited Cambridge from Princeton, for
the term following Newman&rsquo;s lecture course (Copeland &amp; Fan
2023). Von Neumann, a member of the G&ouml;ttingen group during the
mid-1920s, had called the <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> &ldquo;profound and
complex&rdquo;, and he voiced doubts that it was solvable (von Neumann
1927: 11; 1931: 120).</p>

<p>
He was not alone. Hardy gave this statement of the
<em>Entscheidungsproblem</em>, in the course of a famous discussion of
Hilbert&rsquo;s ideas:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Suppose, for example, that we could find a finite system of rules
which enabled us to say whether any given formula was demonstrable or
not. (Hardy 1929: 16)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Hardy foresaw what Turing, and Church, would soon prove, telling his
audience that such a system of rules &ldquo;is not to be
expected&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
What Turing showed is that there will never be, and can never be, a
computing machine satisfying the following specification: When the
user types in a formula&mdash;any formula&mdash;of the functional
calculus, the machine carries out a finite number of steps and then
outputs the correct answer, either &ldquo;This formula is provable in
the functional calculus&rdquo; or &ldquo;This formula is not provable
in the functional calculus&rdquo;, as the case may be. Given,
therefore, Turing&rsquo;s thesis that <em>if an effective method
exists then it can be carried out by one of his machines</em>, it
follows that there is no effective method for deciding the full
first-order functional calculus.</p>

<h2 id="OtheApprComp">3. Other Approaches to Computability</h2>

<p>
Turing and Church were certainly not the only people to tackle the
problem of analyzing the concept of effectiveness. This section
surveys some other important proposals made during the twentieth and
twenty-first centuries.</p>

<h3 id="Gdel">3.1 G&ouml;del</h3>

<p>
G&ouml;del was led to the problem of analyzing effectiveness by his
search for a means to <em>generalize</em> his 1931 incompleteness
results (which in their original form applied specifically to the
formal system set out by Whitehead and Russell in their <em>Principia
Mathematica</em>). In 1934, he considered an analysis in terms of his
generalized concept of recursion&mdash;about a year before Church
first publicly announced his thesis that &ldquo;the notion of an
effectively calculable function of positive integers should be
identified with that of a recursive function&rdquo; (Church 1935a;
G&ouml;del 1934, fn. 3; Davis 1982).</p>

<p>
But G&ouml;del was doubtful: &ldquo;I was, at the time &hellip; not at
all convinced that my concept of recursion comprises all possible
recursions&rdquo; (G&ouml;del 1965b). It was Turing&rsquo;s analysis,
G&ouml;del emphasized, that finally enabled him to generalize his
incompleteness theorems:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
due to A. M. Turing&rsquo;s work, a precise and unquestionably
adequate definition of the general concept of formal system can now be
given. (G&ouml;del 1965a: 71)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He explained:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Turing&rsquo;s work gives an analysis of the concept of
&ldquo;mechanical procedure&rdquo; (alias &ldquo;algorithm&rdquo; or
&ldquo;computation procedure&rdquo; or &ldquo;finite combinatorial
procedure&rdquo;). This concept is shown to be equivalent with that of
a &ldquo;Turing machine&rdquo;. A formal system can simply be defined
to be any mechanical procedure for producing formulas, called provable
formulas. (G&ouml;del 1965a: 71&ndash;72)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Armed with this definition, incompleteness can, G&ouml;del said,
&ldquo;be proved rigorously for <em>every</em> consistent formal
system containing a certain amount of finitary number theory&rdquo;
(1965a: 71).</p>

<h3 id="Post">3.2 Post</h3>

<p>
By 1936, Post had arrived independently at an analysis of
effectiveness that was substantially the same as Turing&rsquo;s (Post
1936; Davis &amp; Sieg 2015). Post&rsquo;s idealized human
&ldquo;worker&rdquo;&mdash;or &ldquo;problem
solver&rdquo;&mdash;operated in a &ldquo;symbol space&rdquo;
consisting of &ldquo;a two way infinite sequence of spaces or
boxes&rdquo;. A box admitted</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
of but two possible conditions, i.e., being empty or unmarked, and
having a single mark in it, say a vertical stroke. (Post 1936:
103)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The problem solver worked in accordance with &ldquo;a fixed
unalterable set of directions&rdquo; and could perform a small number
of &ldquo;primitive acts&rdquo; (Post 1936: 103), namely:</p>

<ol type="1">

<li>determine whether the box that is presently occupied is marked or
not;</li>

<li>erase any mark in the box that is presently occupied;</li>

<li>mark the box that is presently occupied if it is unmarked;</li>

<li>move to the box to the right of the present position; and</li>

<li>move to the box to the left of the present position.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Post&rsquo;s paper was submitted for publication in October 1936, some
five months after Turing&rsquo;s. It contained no analog of
Turing&rsquo;s universal computing machine, and nor did it anticipate
Church&rsquo;s and Turing&rsquo;s result that the <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em>
is unsolvable. Curiously, though, Post had achieved far more than he
let on in his 1936 paper. In an article subtitled &ldquo;Account of an
Anticipation&rdquo;, published in 1965 but written in about 1941, he
explained that during the early 1920s he had devised a system&mdash;he
called it the &ldquo;complete normal system&rdquo;, because &ldquo;in
a way, it contains all normal systems&rdquo;&mdash;and this, he said,
&ldquo;correspond[ed]&rdquo; to Turing&rsquo;s universal machine (Post
1965: 412). Furthermore, he argued during the same period that the
decision problem is unsolvable in the case of his &ldquo;normal
systems&rdquo; (1965: 405ff). But it seems he did not extend this
argument to anticipate the Church-Turing result that the decision
problem for the predicate calculus is unsolvable (1965: 407).</p>

<p>
Turing later generously acknowledged Post&rsquo;s 1936 paper,
describing Turing machines as &ldquo;the logical computing machines
introduced by Post and the author&rdquo; (Turing 1950b: 491).</p>

<h3 id="HilbBern">3.3 Hilbert and Bernays</h3>

<p>
In 1939, in Volume II of their titanic work <em>Grundlagen der
Mathematik</em> (Foundations of Mathematics), Hilbert and Bernays
proposed a logic-based analysis of effectiveness. According to this
analysis, effectively calculable numerical functions are numerical
functions that can be evaluated in what they called a
&ldquo;<em>regelrecht</em>&rdquo; manner (Hilbert &amp; Bernays 1939:
392&ndash;421). In this context, the German word
&ldquo;<em>regelrecht</em>&rdquo; can be translated
&ldquo;rule-governed&rdquo;. Hilbert and Bernays offered the concept
of the <em>rule-governed evaluation</em> of a numerical function as a
&ldquo;sharpening of the concept of computable&rdquo; (1939: 417).</p>

<p>
The basic idea is this: To evaluate a numerical function (such as
addition or multiplication) in a rule-governed way is to calculate the
values of the function, step by logical step, in a suitable deductive
logical system. On this approach, effective calculability is analysed
as <em>calculability in a logic</em>. (Both Church and Turing had
previously discussed the approach&mdash;see
 <a href="#TuriArguII">Section 4.4</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
The logical system Hilbert and Bernays used to flesh out this idea was
an <em>equational calculus</em>, reminiscent of a calculus that
G&ouml;del had detailed in lectures he gave in Princeton in 1934
(G&ouml;del 1934). The theorems of an equational calculus are (as the
name says) <em>equations</em>&mdash;for example \(2^3 = 8\) and \(x^2
+ 1 = x(x + 1) - (x - 1),\) or in general \(\mathrm{f}(m) = n.\) The
Hilbert-Bernays equational calculus contains no logical symbols (such
as negation, conjunction, implication, or quantifiers), and every
formula is simply an equation between terms. Three types of equation
are permitted as the initial formulae (or premisses) of deductions in
the system; and the system is required to satisfy three general
conditions that Hilbert and Bernays called &ldquo;recursivity
conditions&rdquo;. The rules of the calculus concern substitutions
within equations and are very simple, allowing steps such as:</p>

\[ a = b, f(a) \vdash f(b) \]

<p>
On the basis of this calculus (which they called \(Z^0\)) Hilbert and
Bernays established an equivalence result: The numerical functions
that are capable of rule-governed evaluation coincide with the
(primitive) recursive functions (1939: 403 and 393<em>n</em>).</p>

<p>
It is perhaps unsurprising that Hilbert, the founder of proof theory,
ultimately selected an analysis of effective calculability as
calculability <em>within a logic</em>, even though Church and Turing
had already presented their analyses in terms of recursive functions
and Turing machines respectively. Hilbert and Bernays went on to use
their analysis to give a new proof of the unsolvability of the
<em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> (Hilbert &amp; Bernays 1939: 416&ndash;421). This
proof quietly marks what must have been an unsettling, even painful,
shift of perspective for them. The idea of a decision procedure for
mathematics had until the Church-Turing result been central to their
thinking, and in Volume 1 of the <em>Grundlagen</em>, published in
1934, they had assumed the <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> to be solvable.</p>

<h3 id="ModeAxioAnal">3.4 Modern axiomatic analyses</h3>

<p>
Church reported a discussion he had had with G&ouml;del at the time
when it was still wide open how the intuitive concept of effective
calculability should be formalized (probably during 1934). G&ouml;del
suggested that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
it might be possible, in terms of effective calculability as an
undefined notion, to state a set of axioms which would embody the
generally accepted properties of this notion, and to do something on
that basis. (Church 1935b)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Logicians frequently analyse a concept of interest, e.g., universal
quantification, not by defining it in terms of other concepts, but by
stating a set of axioms that collectively embody the generally
accepted properties of (say) universal quantification. To follow this
approach in the case of effectiveness, we would &ldquo;write down some
axioms about computable functions which most people would agree are
evidently true&rdquo; (Shoenfield 1993: 26). Shoenfield continued,
&ldquo;It might be possible to prove Church&rsquo;s Thesis from such
axioms&rdquo;, but added: &ldquo;However, despite strenuous efforts,
no one has succeeded in doing this&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Moving on a few years, a meeting on <em>The Prospects for Mathematical
Logic in the Twenty-First Century</em>, held at the turn of the
millennium, included the following among leading open problems:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&ldquo;Prove&rdquo; the Church-Turing thesis by finding intuitively
obvious or at least clearly acceptable properties of computation that
suffice to guarantee that any function so computed is recursive [and
therefore can be computed by a Turing machine]. (Shore in Buss et al.
2001: 174&ndash;175)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The axiomatic type of approach sketched by G&ouml;del has by now been
developed in a number of quite different ways. These axiomatic
frameworks go a long way toward countering Montague&rsquo;s complaint
of over 60 years ago that &ldquo;Discussion of Church&rsquo;s thesis
has suffered for lack of a precise general framework within which it
could be conducted&rdquo; (Montague 1960: 432). Some examples of the
axiomatic approach are as follows (in chronological order):</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>
Gandy (Turing&rsquo;s only PhD student) pointed out that
Turing&rsquo;s analysis of human computation does not immediately
apply to computing machines strongly dissimilar from Turing machines.
(See
 <a href="#TuriArguI">Section 4.3</a>
 below for details of Turing&rsquo;s analysis.) For example,
Turing&rsquo;s analysis does not obviously apply to parallel machines
which, unlike a Turing machine, are able to process an arbitrary
number of symbols simultaneously. Seeking a generalized form of
Turing&rsquo;s analysis that applies equally well to Turing machines
and massively parallel machines, Gandy (1980) stated four axioms
governing the behaviour of what he called <em>discrete deterministic
mechanical devices</em>. (He formulated the axioms in terms of
hereditarily finite sets.) Gandy was then able to prove that every
device satisfying these axioms can be simulated by a Turing machine:
Discrete deterministic mechanical devices, even massively parallel
ones, are no more powerful than Turing machines, in the sense that
whatever computations such a device is able to perform can also be
done by the universal Turing machine. (For more on Gandy&rsquo;s
analysis, see
 <a href="#GandArgu">Section 6.4.2</a>.)</p>

<p>
Engeler axiomatized the concept of an algorithmic function by using
<em>combinators</em> (Engeler 1983: ch. III). Combinators were
originally introduced by Sch&ouml;nfinkel in 1924, in a paper that a
recent book on combinators described as &ldquo;presenting a formalism
for universal computation for the very first time&rdquo;
(Sch&ouml;nfinkel 1924; Wolfram 2021: 214). Sch&ouml;nfinkel&rsquo;s
combinators were extensively developed by Curry (Curry 1929, 1930a,b,
1932; Curry &amp; Feys 1958). Examples of combinators are the
&ldquo;permutator&rdquo; \(\mathrm{C}\) and the
&ldquo;cancellator&rdquo; \(\mathrm{K}\). These produce the following
effects: \(\mathrm{C}xyz = xzy\) and \(\mathrm{K}xy = x\).</p> </li>

<li>

<p>
Sieg formalized Turing&rsquo;s analysis of human computation by means
of four axioms (Sieg 2008). The result, Sieg said, is an axiomatic
characterization of &ldquo;the concept &lsquo;mechanical
procedure&rsquo;&rdquo;, and he observed that his system
&ldquo;substantiates G&ouml;del&rsquo;s remarks&rdquo; (above) that
one should try to find a set of axioms embodying the generally
accepted properties of the concept of effectiveness (Sieg 2008:
150).</p> </li>

<li>

<p>
Dershowitz and Gurevich (2008) stated three very general axioms,
treating computations as discrete, deterministic,
sequentially-evolving structures of states. They called these
structures &ldquo;state-transition systems&rdquo;, and called the
three axioms the &ldquo;Sequential Postulates&rdquo;. They also used a
fourth axiom, stipulating that &ldquo;Only undeniably computable
operations are available in initial states&rdquo; (2008: 306). From
their four axioms, they proved a proposition they called
Church&rsquo;s thesis: &ldquo;Every numeric function computed by a
state-transition system satisfying the Sequential Postulates, and
provided initially with only basic arithmetic, is partial
recursive&rdquo; (2008: 327).</p> </li>
</ul>

<p>
Returning to the <em>very idea</em> of proving the Church-Turing
thesis, it is important to note that the proposition Dershowitz and
Gurevich call Church&rsquo;s thesis is in fact <em>not</em> the thesis
stated by Church, viz. &ldquo;A function of positive integers is
effectively calculable only if recursive&rdquo;. Crucially, their
version of Church&rsquo;s thesis does not even mention the key concept
of effective calculability. The entire project of trying to prove
Church&rsquo;s (or Turing&rsquo;s) actual thesis has its share of
philosophical difficulties. For example, suppose someone were to lay
down some axioms expressing claims about effective calculability (as
Sieg for instance has done), and suppose it is possible to prove from
these axioms that a function of positive integers is effectively
calculable only if recursive. Church&rsquo;s thesis would have been
proved from the axioms, but whether the axioms form a satisfactory
account of effective calculability is a <em>further</em> question. If
they do not, then this &ldquo;proof&rdquo; of Church&rsquo;s thesis
could carry no conviction. Which is to say, a proof of this sort will
be convincing only to one who accepts another thesis, namely that the
axioms are indeed a satisfactory account of effective calculability.
This is a Churchian meta-thesis. Church&rsquo;s thesis would have been
proved, but only at the expense of throwing up another, unproved,
thesis seemingly of the same nature.</p>

There is further discussion of difficulties associated with the idea
of proving the Church-Turing thesis in

<h2 id="CaseForChurTuriThes">4. The Case for the Church-Turing Thesis</h2>

<h3 id="InduEquiArgu">4.1 The inductive and equivalence arguments</h3>

<p>
Although there have from time to time been attempts to call the
Church-Turing thesis into question (for example by Kalm&aacute;r in
his 1959; Mendelson replied in his 1963), the summary of the situation
that Turing gave in 1948 is no less true today: &ldquo;it is now
agreed amongst logicians that &lsquo;calculable by L.C.M.&rsquo; is
the correct accurate rendering&rdquo; of the informal concept of
effectiveness.</p>

<p>
In 1936, both Church and Turing gave various grounds for accepting
their respective theses. Church argued:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The fact &hellip; that two such widely different and (in the opinion
of the author) equally natural definitions of effective calculability
[i.e., in terms of &lambda;-definability and recursion] turn out to be
<em>equivalent</em> adds to the strength of the reasons adduced below
for believing that they constitute as general a characterization of
this notion as is consistent with the usual intuitive understanding of
it. (Church 1936a: 346, emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Church&rsquo;s &ldquo;reasons adduced below&rdquo; comprised two not
wholly convincing arguments. Both suffered from the same weakness,
discussed in
 <a href="#CompChurTuriArgu">Section 4.4.4</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Turing, on the other hand, marshalled a formidable case for the
thesis. Unlike Church, he offered inductive evidence for it, showing
that large classes of numbers &ldquo;which would naturally be regarded
as computable&rdquo; are computable in his sense (1936: 74&ndash;75).
Turing proved, for example, that the limit of a computably convergent
sequence is computable; that all real algebraic numbers are
computable; that the real zeroes of the Bessel functions are
computable; and that (as previously noted) &pi; and e are computable
(1936: 79&ndash;83). But most importantly of all, Turing gave profound
logico-philosophical arguments for the thesis. He referred to these
arguments simply as &ldquo;I&rdquo;, &ldquo;II&rdquo; and
&ldquo;III&rdquo;. They are described in
 <a href="#TuriArguI">Section 4.3</a>
 and
 <a href="#TuriArguII">Section 4.4</a>.</p>
 
<p>
By about 1950, considerable evidence had amassed for the thesis. One
of the fullest surveys of this evidence is to be found in chapters 12
and 13 of Kleene&rsquo;s 1952. As well as discussing Turing&rsquo;s
argument I, and Church&rsquo;s two arguments mentioned above, Kleene
bolstered Church&rsquo;s just quoted <em>equivalence argument</em>,
pointing out that &ldquo;Several other characterizations &hellip; have
turned out to be equivalent&rdquo; (1952: 320). As well as the
characterizations mentioned by Church, Kleene included computability
by Turing machine, Post&rsquo;s canonical and normal systems (Post
1943, 1946), and G&ouml;del&rsquo;s notion of reckonability
(G&ouml;del 1936). (Turing&rsquo;s student and lifelong friend Robin
Gandy picturesquely called Church&rsquo;s equivalence argument the
&ldquo;argument by confluence&rdquo; [Gandy 1988: 78].)</p>

<p>
In modern times, the equivalence argument can be presented even more
forcefully: All attempts to give an exact characterization of the
intuitive notion of an effectively calculable function have turned out
to be <em>equivalent</em>, in the sense that each characterization
offered has been proved to pick out the same class of functions,
namely those that are computable by Turing machine. The equivalence
argument is often considered to be very strong evidence for the
thesis, because of the <em>diversity</em> of the various formal
characterizations involved. Apart from the many different
characterizations already mentioned in
 <a href="#ThesHist">Section 1</a>
 and
 <a href="#OtheApprComp">Section 3</a>,
 there are also analyses in terms of register machines (Shepherdson
&amp; Sturgis 1963), Markov algorithms (Markov 1951), and other
formalisms.</p>

<p>
The equivalence argument may be summed up by saying that the concept
of effective calculability&mdash;or the concept of computability
simpliciter&mdash;has turned out to be
<em>formalism-transcendent</em>, or even &ldquo;formalism-free&rdquo;
(Kennedy 2013: 362), in that all these different formal approaches
pick out exactly the <em>same</em> class of functions.</p>

<p>
Indeed, there is not even a need to distinguish, within any given
formal approach, systems of different orders or types. G&ouml;del
noted in an abstract published in 1936 that the concept
&ldquo;computable&rdquo; is <em>absolute</em>, in the sense that all
the computable functions are specifiable in one and the same system,
there being no need to introduce a hierarchy of systems of different
orders&mdash;as is done, for example, in Tarskian analyses of the
concept &ldquo;true&rdquo;, and standardly in the case of the concept
&ldquo;provable&rdquo; (G&ouml;del 1936: 24). Ten years later,
commenting on Turing&rsquo;s work, G&ouml;del emphasized that
&ldquo;the great importance &hellip; [of] Turing&rsquo;s
computability&rdquo; is</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
largely due to the fact that with this concept one has for the first
time succeeded in giving an absolute definition of an interesting
epistemological notion, i.e., one not depending on the formalism
chosen. In all other cases treated previously, such as demonstrability
or definability, one has been able to define them only relative to a
given language&hellip;. (G&ouml;del 1946: 150)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In his 1952 survey, Kleene also developed Turing&rsquo;s inductive
argument (1952: 319&ndash;320). To summarize:</p>

<ul>

<li>Every effectively calculable function that has been investigated
in this respect has turned out to be computable by Turing
machine.</li>

<li>All known methods or operations for obtaining new effectively
calculable functions from given effectively calculable functions are
paralleled by methods for constructing new Turing machines from given
Turing machines.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Inductive evidence for the thesis has continued to accumulate. For
example, Gurevich points out that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
As far as the input-output relation is concerned, synchronous parallel
algorithms and interactive sequential algorithms can be simulated by
Turing machines. This gives additional confirmation of the
Church-Turing thesis. (Gurevich 2012: 33)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="SkepAbouInduEquiArgu">4.2 Skepticism about the inductive and equivalence arguments</h3>

<p>
It is a general feature of inductive arguments that, while they may
supply strong evidence, they nevertheless do not establish their
conclusions with certainty. A stronger argument for the Church-Turing
thesis is to be desired. Gandy said that the inductive argument</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
cannot settle the philosophical (or foundational) question. It might
happen that one day some genius established an entirely new sort of
calculation. (Gandy 1988: 79)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Dershowitz and Gurevich highlighted the difficulty:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
History is full of examples of delayed discoveries. Aristotelian and
Newtonian mechanics lasted much longer than the seventy years that
have elapsed since Church proposed identifying effectiveness with
recursiveness, but still those physical theories were eventually found
lacking. (Dershowitz &amp; Gurevich 2008: 304)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Dershowitz and Gurevich presented a highly relevant example of delayed
discovery (following Barendregt 1997: 187): Any hope that the
effectively calculable functions could be identified with the
<em>primitive</em> recursive functions&mdash;introduced in 1923
(Skolem 1923; P&eacute;ter 1935)&mdash;evaporated a few years later,
when Ackermann described an effectively calculable function that is
not primitive recursive (Ackermann 1928).</p>

<p>
The equivalence argument has also been deemed unsatisfactory.
Dershowitz and Gurevich call it &ldquo;weak&rdquo; (2008: 304). After
all, the fact that a number of statements are equivalent does not show
the statements are true, only that if one is true, all are&mdash;and
if one is false, all are. Kreisel wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The support for Church&rsquo;s thesis &hellip; certainly does not
consist in &hellip; the equivalence of different characterizations:
what excludes the case of a <em>systematic</em> error? (Kreisel 1965:
144)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Mendelson put the point more mildly, saying that the equivalence
argument is &ldquo;not conclusive&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is conceivable that all the equivalent notions define a concept
that is related to, but not identical with, effective computability.
(Mendelson 1990: 228)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Clearly, what is required is a direct argument for the thesis from
first principles. Turing&rsquo;s argument I fills this role.</p>

<h3 id="TuriArguI">4.3 Turing&rsquo;s argument I</h3>

<p>
The logico-philosophical arguments that Turing gave in Section 9 of
&ldquo;On Computable Numbers&rdquo; are outstanding among the reasons
for accepting the thesis.</p>

<p>
He introduced argument I as &ldquo;only an elaboration&rdquo; of
remarks at the beginning of his 1936 paper&mdash;such as:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We may compare a man in the process of computing a real number to a
machine which is only capable of a finite number of conditions
\(q_1,\) \(q_2,\)&hellip;, \(q_R\) which will be called
&ldquo;\(m\)-configurations&rdquo;. (Turing 1936 [2004: 59, 75])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He also described argument I as a &ldquo;direct appeal to
intuition&rdquo; (Turing 1936 [2004: 75]). The appeal he is talking
about concerns our understanding of which features of human
computation are the <em>essential</em> features (some examples of
<em>in</em>essential features are that human computers eat, breathe,
and sleep).</p>

<p>
In outline, argument I runs as follows: Given that human computation
has <em>these</em> (and only these) essential features&mdash;and here
Turing supplied a list of features&mdash;then, whichever human
computation is specified, a Turing machine can be designed to carry
out the computation. Therefore, the Turing-machine computable numbers
include all numbers that would naturally be regarded as computable
(Turing&rsquo;s thesis).</p>

<h4 id="TuriAnal">4.3.1 Turing&rsquo;s analysis</h4>

<p>
Turing&rsquo;s list of the essential features of human computation is
as follows (Turing 1936 [2004: 75&ndash;76]):</p>

<ol id="features" start="1" type="1">

<li id="feature1">Computers write symbols on two-dimensional sheets of
paper, which may be considered to be (or may actually be) divided up
into squares, each square containing no more than a single individual
symbol.</li>

<li id="feature2">The computer is not able to recognize, or print,
more than a finite number of different types of individual
symbol.</li>

<li id="feature3">The computer is not able to observe an unlimited
number of squares all at once&mdash;if he or she wishes to observe
more squares than can be taken in at one time, then successive
observations must be made. (Say the maximum number of squares the
computer can observe at any one moment is \(B\), where \(B\) is some
positive integer.)</li>

<li id="feature4">When the computer makes a fresh observation in order
to view more squares, none of the newly observed squares will be more
than a certain fixed distance away from the nearest previously
observed square. (Say this fixed distance consists of \(L\) squares,
where \(L\) is some positive integer.)</li>

<li id="feature5">In order to alter a symbol (e.g., to replace it by a
different symbol), the computer needs to be actually observing the
square containing the symbol.</li>

<li id="feature6">The computer&rsquo;s behavior at any moment is
determined by the symbols that he or she is observing and his or her
&ldquo;state of mind&rdquo; at that moment. Moreover, the
computer&rsquo;s state of mind at any given moment, together with the
symbols he or she is observing at that moment, determine the
computer&rsquo;s state of mind at the next moment.</li>

<li id="feature7">The number of states of mind that need to be taken
into account when describing the computer&rsquo;s behavior is
finite.</li>

<li id="feature8">The operations the computer performs can be split up
into elementary operations. These are so simple that no more than one
symbol is altered in a single elementary operation.</li>

<li id="feature9">All elementary operations are of one or other of the
following forms:

<ol type="a">

<li>A change of state of mind.</li>

<li>A change of observed squares, together with a possible change of
state of mind.</li>

<li>A change of symbol, together with a possible change of state of
mind.</li>
</ol> </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="NextStepBLTypeTuriMach">4.3.2 Next step: \(B\)-\(L\)-type Turing machines</h4>

<p>
The next step of argument I is to establish that if human computation
has those and only those essential features, then, whatever human
computation is specified, a Turing machine can be designed to perform
the computation. In order to show this, Turing introduced a modified
form of Turing machine, which can be called a
&ldquo;\(B\)-\(L\)-type&rdquo; Turing machine. A \(B\)-\(L\)-type
Turing machine has much in common with an ordinary Turing machine:</p>

<ol type="i">

<li>A&nbsp;\(B\)-\(L\)-type Turing machine consists of a scanner and a
one-dimensional paper tape; the tape is divided into squares.</li>

<li>The scanner contains mechanisms that enable it to move the tape to
the left or right.</li>

<li>The scanner&rsquo;s mechanisms also enable it recognize, delete,
and print symbols.</li>

<li>The scanner is able to recognize and print only a finite number of
different types of individual symbol.</li>

<li>At any moment, the control mechanism of the scanner will be in any
one of a finite number of internal states. Turing terms these
&ldquo;\(m\)-configurations&rdquo;. He included an explanatory remark
about \(m\)-configurations in a summary in French of the central ideas
of &ldquo;On Computable Numbers&rdquo;: Inside the machine,
&ldquo;levers, wheels, et cetera can be arranged in several ways,
called &lsquo;\(m\)-configurations&rsquo;&rdquo;. (The complete
summary is translated in Copeland &amp; Fan 2022.)</li>

<li>The machine&rsquo;s behavior at any moment is determined by its
\(m\)-configuration and the symbols it is observing (i.e.,
scanning).</li>

<li>The machine&rsquo;s possible behaviors are limited to moving the
tape, deleting the symbol on an observed square, and printing a symbol
on an observed square. Each of these behaviors may be accompanied by a
change in \(m\)-configuration.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Moving on now to the differences between ordinary Turing machines and
\(B\)-\(L\)-type machines:</p>

<ol start="8" type="i">

<li>The scanner of a \(B\)-\(L\)-type machine can observe up to \(B\)
squares at once; whereas the scanner of an ordinary Turing machine can
observe only a single square of the tape at any one moment. A Turing
machine that is able to survey a sequence of squares all at once like
this is sometimes known by the (perhaps inelegant) term &ldquo;string
machine&rdquo;.</li>

<li>The scanner of a \(B\)-\(L\)-type machine can, in a single
operation, move the tape up to \(L\) squares at once (to the left or
right of any one of the immediately previously observed squares);
whereas the scanner of an ordinary machine can move the tape by only
one square in a single elementary operation.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Returning to the argument, Turing asserted that, given his account
1&ndash;9 of the essential features of human computation, a
\(B\)-\(L\)-type machine can &ldquo;do the work&rdquo; of any human
computer (1936: 77). This is because the \(B\)-\(L\)-type machine
either duplicates or can simulate each of
 <a href="#features">features 1&ndash;9</a>.
 Let us take these features in turn.</p>

<p>

 <a href="#feature1">Feature 1</a>
 is simulated by the machine: The \(B\)-\(L\)-type machine uses its
one-dimensional tape to mimic the computer&rsquo;s two-dimensional
sheets of paper. Turing said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I think it will be agreed that the two-dimensional character of paper
is no essential of computation. (Turing 1936 [2004: 75])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
However, some commentators note that there is room for doubt about
this matter. Gandy complained that Turing here argued &ldquo;much too
briefly&rdquo;, saying:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is not totally obvious that calculations carried out in two (or
three) dimensions can be put on a one-dimensional tape and yet
preserve the &ldquo;local&rdquo; properties. (Gandy 1988: 81,
82&ndash;83)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Dershowitz and Gurevich ask:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[H]ow certain is it that each and every elaborate data structure used
during a computation can be encoded as a string, and its operations
simulated by effective string manipulations? (Dershowitz &amp;
Gurevich 2008: 305)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Progressing to the other features on Turing&rsquo;s list: 2, 3, 4 and
5 are straightforwardly duplicated in the machine.
 <a href="#feature6">Features 6 and 7</a>
 are simulated, by letting the machine&rsquo;s \(m\)-configurations do
duty for the computer&rsquo;s states of mind (more on that below).
 <a href="#feature8">Feature 8</a>
 is duplicated in the machine: the machine&rsquo;s complex operations
(such as long multiplication and division) are built up out of
elementary operations. Feature 9 is simulated, again by letting the
\(m\)-configurations to do duty for human states of mind.</p>

<h4 id="FinaStep">4.3.3 Final step</h4>

<p>
The next and final step of argument I involves the statement that any
computation done by a \(B\)-\(L\)-type machine can also be done by an
ordinary Turing machine. This is straightforward, since by means of a
sequence of single-square moves, the ordinary machine can simulate a
\(B\)-\(L\)-type machine&rsquo;s tape-moves of up to \(L\) squares at
once; and the ordinary machine can also simulate the \(B\)-\(L\)-type
machine&rsquo;s scanning of up to \(B\) squares at once, by means of a
sequence of single-square scannings (interspersed where necessary with
changes of \(m\)-configuration). Thus, if a \(B\)-\(L\)-type machine
can &ldquo;do the work&rdquo; of a human computer, so can an ordinary
Turing machine.</p>

<p>
In summary, Turing has shown the following&mdash;provided his claim is
accepted that &ldquo;To each state of mind of the computer corresponds
an &lsquo;\(m\)-configuration&rsquo; of the machine&rdquo;: <em>Given
the above account of the essential features of human computation, an
ordinary Turing machine is able to do the work of any human
computer</em>. In other words: Subject to that proviso and that given,
he has established his thesis that the numbers computable by an
ordinary Turing machine include all numbers which would naturally be
regarded as computable.</p>

<h4 id="StatMindArguIII">4.3.4 States of mind, and argument III</h4>

<p>
But should Turing&rsquo;s claim about the correspondence of states of
mind and \(m\)-configurations be accepted? Might not human states of
mind greatly surpass arrangements of levers and wheels? Might not the
computer&rsquo;s states of mind sometimes determine him or her to
change the symbols in a way that a \(B\)-\(L\)-type machine
cannot?</p>

<p>
Turing addressed worries about the correspondence between states of
mind and \(m\)-configurations in his supplementary argument III, which
he said &ldquo;may be regarded as a modification of I&rdquo; (1936:
79). Here he argued that reference to the computer&rsquo;s states of
mind can be avoided altogether, by talking instead about what he
called a &ldquo;note of instructions&rdquo;. A note of instructions,
he said, is &ldquo;a more definite and physical counterpart&rdquo; of
a state of mind. Each step of the human computation can be regarded as
being governed by a note of instructions&mdash;by means of following
the instructions in the note, the computer will know what operation to
perform at that step (erase, print, or move). Turing envisaged the
computer preparing new notes on the fly, as the computation
progresses: &ldquo;The note of instructions must enable him [the
computer] to carry out one step and write the next note&rdquo;. Each
note is in effect a tiny computer program, which both carries out a
single step of the computation and also writes the program that is to
be used at the next step.</p>

<p>
Once instruction notes are in the picture, there is no need to refer
to the human computer&rsquo;s states of mind:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the state of progress of the computation at any stage is completely
determined by the note of instructions and the symbols on the tape.
(Turing 1936 [2004: 79])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Another&mdash;related&mdash;way of answering the worry that human
states of mind might surpass the machine&rsquo;s \(m\)-configurations
is to point out that, even if this were true, it would make no
essential difference to argument I. This is because of
 <a href="#feature3">feature 3</a>
 and
 <a href="#feature7">feature 7</a>
 (<a href="#TuriAnal">Section 4.3.1</a>): The number of states of mind that need to be taken
into account is finite, and the maximum number of squares that the
computer can observe at any one moment is \(B\) (a finite number).</p>

<p>
Given
 <a href="#feature7">feature 7</a>,
 it follows that no matter how fancy a state of mind might be, the
computer&rsquo;s relevant behaviors when in that state of mind can be
encapsulated by means of finite table. Each row of the table will be
of the following form: If the observed symbols are such-and-such, then
perform elementary operation so-and-so (where the elementary
operations are as specified in
 <a href="#feature9">feature 9</a>).
 Since only a finite number of states of mind are in consideration
 (<a href="#feature3">feature 3</a>)&mdash;say
 \(n\)&mdash;all necessary information about the computer&rsquo;s
states of mind can be encapsulated in a list of \(n\) such tables.
This list consists of finitely many symbols, and therefore it can be
placed on the tape of a \(B\)-\(L\)-type machine in advance of the
machine beginning its emulation of the human computer. (This is akin
to writing a program on the tape of a universal Turing machine.) The
\(B\)-\(L\)-type machine consults the list at each step of the
computation, and the machine&rsquo;s behavior at every step is
completely determined by the list together with the currently observed
symbols.</p>

<p>
To conclude: no matter what powers might be accorded to the human
computer&rsquo;s states of mind, a \(B\)-\(L\)-type machine can
nevertheless &ldquo;do the work&rdquo; of the computer, so long as
only finitely many states of mind need be taken into consideration
(given, of course, the remainder of Turing&rsquo;s account of the
essential features of computation).</p>

<h4 id="TuriTheo">4.3.5 Turing&rsquo;s theorem</h4>

<p>
Now that the proviso mentioned above about states of mind has been
cleared out of the way, Turing&rsquo;s achievement in argument I can
be summed up like this: He has, in Gandy&rsquo;s phrase,
&ldquo;outlined a proof&rdquo; of a theorem (Gandy 1980: 124).</p>

<blockquote id="turingscomputationaltheorem">

<p>
<strong>Turing&rsquo;s computation theorem</strong>:
<br />
This account of the essential features of human computation implies
Turing&rsquo;s thesis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It should by now be completely clear why Turing called argument I a
&ldquo;direct appeal to intuition&rdquo;. If one&rsquo;s intuition
tells one that Turing&rsquo;s account of the essential features of
human computation is correct, then the theorem can be applied and
Turing&rsquo;s thesis is secured.</p>

<p>
However, Turing&rsquo;s account is not immune from skepticism. Some
skeptical questions are: Might there be aspects of human computation
that Turing has overlooked? Might a computer who is limited by
1&ndash;9 be unable to perform some calculations that <em>can</em> be
done by a human computer not so restricted? Also, must the number of
states of mind that need to be taken into account when describing the
computer&rsquo;s behavior always be finite? G&ouml;del thought the
number of Turing&rsquo;s &ldquo;distinguishable states of mind&rdquo;
may &ldquo;converge toward infinity&rdquo;, saying</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
What Turing disregards completely is the fact that <em>mind, in its
use, is not static, but constantly developing</em>. (G&ouml;del 1972:
306)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Indeed, what are the <em>grounds</em> supposed to be for thinking that
1&ndash;9 are true? Are these claims supposed to be grounded in the
nature and limitations of the human sense organs and the human mind?
Or are they supposed to be grounded in some other way, e.g., in the
fundamental nature of <em>effective methods</em>?</p>

<p>
Turing&rsquo;s argument I is a towering landmark and there is now a
sizable literature on these and other questions concerning it. For
more about this important argument see, for starters, Sieg 1994, 2008;
Shagrir 2006; and Copeland &amp; Shagrir 2013.</p>

<h3 id="TuriArguII">4.4 Turing&rsquo;s argument II</h3>

<h4 id="CalcLogi">4.4.1 Calculating in a logic</h4>

<p>
Kleene, in his survey of evidence for the Church-Turing thesis, listed
a type of argument based on symbolic logic (Kleene 1952: 322&ndash;3).
(He called these category &ldquo;D&rdquo; arguments.) Arguments of
this type commence by introducing a plausible alternative method of
characterizing effectively calculable functions (or, in Turing&rsquo;s
case, computable functions or numbers). The alternative method
involves derivability in one or another symbolic logic: The concept of
effective calculability (or of computability) is characterized in
terms of <em>calculability within the logic</em> (see
 <a href="#HilbBern">Section 3.3</a>).
 Schematically, the characterization is of the form: A function is
effectively calculable (or computable) if each successive value of the
function is derivable within the logic. The next step of the argument
is then to establish that the new characterization (whatever it is) is
equivalent to the old. In Church&rsquo;s case, this amounts to arguing
that the new characterization is equivalent to his characterization in
terms of either recursiveness or &lambda;-definability. Finally, the
conclusion that the new and previous characterizations are equivalent
is claimed as further evidence in favor of the Church-Turing
thesis.</p>

<p>
In his survey, Kleene illustrated this approach by describing an
argument of Church&rsquo;s (Church 1936a: 357&ndash;358).
Turing&rsquo;s argument II is also of this type, but, curiously,
Kleene did not mention it (despite assigning five pages of his 1952
survey to Turing&rsquo;s argument I).</p>

<h4 id="ChurStepStepArgu">4.4.2 Church&rsquo;s &ldquo;step-by-step&rdquo; argument</h4>

<p>
It is instructive to examine Church&rsquo;s argument&mdash;which Gandy
dubbed the &ldquo;step-by-step&rdquo; argument (Gandy 1988:
77)&mdash;before considering Turing&rsquo;s II. Church introduced the
following alternative method, describing it as among the
&ldquo;methods which naturally suggest themselves&rdquo; in connection
with defining effective calculability:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a function \(F\) (of one positive integer) [is defined] to be
effectively calculable if, for every positive integer \(m\), there
exists a positive integer \(n\) such that \(F(m) = n\) is a provable
theorem. (Church 1936a: 358)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Church did not specify any particular symbolic logic. He merely
stipulated a number of general conditions that the logic must satisfy
(1936a: 357). These included the stipulations that the list of axioms
of the logic must be either finite or enumerably infinite, and that
each rule of the logic must specify an &ldquo;effectively calculable
operation&rdquo; (the latter is necessary, he said, if the logic
&ldquo;is to serve at all the purposes for which a system of symbolic
logic is usually intended&rdquo;). Having introduced this alternative
method of characterizing effective calculability, Church then went on
to argue that every function (of one positive integer) that is
&ldquo;calculable within the logic&rdquo; in this way is also
recursive. He concluded, in support of Church&rsquo;s thesis, that the
new method produces &ldquo;no more general definition of effective
calculability than that proposed&rdquo;, i.e., in terms of
recursiveness (1936a: 358).</p>

<h4 id="TuriVari">4.4.3 Turing&rsquo;s variant</h4>

<p>
Turing&rsquo;s prefatory remarks to argument II bring out its broad
similarity to Church&rsquo;s argument. Turing described II as being a
&ldquo;proof of the equivalence of two definitions&rdquo;,
adding&mdash;&ldquo;in case the new definition has a greater intuitive
appeal&rdquo; (1936 [2004: 75]).</p>

<p>
Turing&rsquo;s argument, unlike Church&rsquo;s, does involve a
specific symbolic logic, namely Hilbert&rsquo;s first-order predicate
calculus. Argument II hinges on a proposition that can be called</p>

<blockquote id="turingsprovabilitytheorem">

<p>
<strong>Turing&rsquo;s provability theorem</strong>:
<br />
Every formula provable in Hilbert&rsquo;s first-order predicate
calculus can be proved by the universal Turing machine. (See Turing
1936 [2004: 77].)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The alternative method considered by Turing (which is similar to
Church&rsquo;s) characterizes a computable number (or sequence) in
terms of statements each of which supplies the next digit of the
number (or sequence). The number (sequence) is said to be computable
if each such statement is provable in Hilbert&rsquo;s calculus (the
idea being that, if this is so, then Hilbert&rsquo;s calculus may be
used to calculate&mdash;or compute&mdash;the digits of the number one
by one). Employing the provability theorem, Turing then showed the
following: Every number that is computable according to this
alternative definition is also computable according to the
Turing-machine definition (i.e., the digits of the number can be
written out progressively by a Turing machine), and vice versa (Turing
1936 [2004: 78]). In other words, he proved the equivalence of the two
definitions, as promised.</p>

<h4 id="CompChurTuriArgu">4.4.4 Comparing the Church and Turing arguments</h4>

<p>
Returning to Church&rsquo;s step-by-step argument, there is an air of
jiggery-pokery about it. Church wished to conclude that functions
&ldquo;calculable within the logic&rdquo; are recursive, and, in the
course of arguing for this, he found it necessary to assert that each
rule of the logic is a recursive operation, on the basis that each
rule is required to be an effectively calculable operation. In a
different context, he might have supported this assertion by appealing
to Church&rsquo;s thesis (which says, after all, that what is
effectively calculable is recursive). But in the present context, such
an appeal would naturally be question-begging.</p>

<p>
Nor did Church make any such appeal. (Sieg described Church&rsquo;s
reasoning as &ldquo;semi-circular&rdquo;, but this seems too
harsh&mdash;there is nothing circular about it; Sieg 1994: 87, 2002:
394.) But nor did Church offer any compelling reasons in support of
his assertion. He merely gave examples of systems whose rules
<em>are</em> recursive operations; and also said&mdash;having
stipulated that each rule of procedure must be an effectively
calculable operation&mdash;that he will &ldquo;<em>interpret this to
mean</em> that &hellip; each rule of procedure must be a recursive
operation&rdquo; (1936: 357, italics added.) In short, a crucial step
of Church&rsquo;s argument for Church&rsquo;s thesis receives
inadequate support. Sieg famously dubbed this step the
&ldquo;stumbling block&rdquo; in Church&rsquo;s argument (Sieg 1994:
87).</p>

<p>
There is no such difficulty in Turing&rsquo;s argument. Having
selected a specific logic (Hilbert&rsquo;s calculus), Turing was able
specify a Turing machine that would &ldquo;find all the provable
formulae of the calculus&rdquo;, so making it indubitable that
functions calculable in the logic are Turing-machine computable
(Turing 1936 [2004: 77]). For this reason, Turing&rsquo;s argument II
is to be preferred to Church&rsquo;s step-by-step argument.</p>

<h3 id="KripVersArguII">4.5 Kripke&rsquo;s version of argument II</h3>

<p>
A significant recent contribution to the area has been made by Kripke
(2013). A conventional view of the status of the Church-Turing thesis
is that, while &ldquo;very considerable intuitive evidence&rdquo; has
amassed for the thesis, the thesis is &ldquo;not a precise enough
issue to be itself susceptible to mathematical treatment&rdquo;
(Kripke 2013: 77). Kleene gave an early expression of this now
conventional view:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Since our original notion of effective calculability of a function
&hellip; is a somewhat vague intuitive one, the thesis cannot be
proved. &hellip; While we cannot prove Church&rsquo;s thesis, since
its role is to delimit precisely an hitherto vaguely conceived
totality, we require evidence &hellip;. (Kleene 1952: 318)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Rejecting the conventional view, Kripke suggests that, on the
contrary, the Church-Turing thesis is susceptible to mathematical
proof. Furthermore, he canvasses the idea that Turing himself sketched
an argument that serves to prove the thesis.</p>

<p>
Kripke attempts to build a mathematical demonstration of the
Church-Turing thesis around Turing&rsquo;s argument II. He claims that
his demonstration is &ldquo;very close&rdquo; to Turing&rsquo;s
(Kripke 2013: 80). However, this is debatable, since, in its detail,
the Kripke argument differs considerably from argument II. But one can
at least say that Kripke&rsquo;s argument was inspired by
Turing&rsquo;s argument II, and belongs in Kleene&rsquo;s category
&ldquo;D&rdquo; (along with II and Church&rsquo;s step-by-step
argument).</p>

<p>
Kripke argues that the Church-Turing thesis is a corollary of
G&ouml;del&rsquo;s completeness theorem for first-order predicate
calculus with identity. Put somewhat crudely, the latter theorem
states that every <em>valid</em> deduction (couched in the language of
first-order predicate calculus with identity) is <em>provable</em> in
the calculus. In other words, the deduction of \(B\) from premises
\(A_{1},\) \(A_{2},\) &hellip; \(A_{n}\) (where statements \(A_{1},\)
\(A_{2},\) &hellip; \(A_{n},\) \(B\) are all in the language of
first-order predicate calculus with identity) is logically valid if
and only if \(B\) can be proved from \(A_{1},\) \(A_{2},\) &hellip;
\(A_{n}\) in the calculus.</p>

<p>
The first step of the Kripke argument is his claim that (error-free,
human) computation is itself a form of deduction:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[A] computation is a special form of mathematical argument. One is
given a set of instructions, and the steps in the computation are
supposed to follow&mdash;follow deductively&mdash;from the
instructions as given. <em>So a computation is just another
mathematical deduction, albeit one of a very specialized form</em>.
(Kripke 2013: 80)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The following two-line program in pseudo-code illustrates
Kripke&rsquo;s claim. The symbol &ldquo;\(\rightarrow\)&rdquo; is read
&ldquo;becomes&rdquo;, and &ldquo;=&rdquo; as usual means identity.
The first instruction in the program is \(r \rightarrow 2\). This
tells the computer to place the value 2 in storage location \(r\)
(assumed to be initially empty). The second instruction \(r
\rightarrow r + 3\) tells the computer to add 3 to the content of
\(r\) and store the result in \(r\) (over-writing the previous content
of \(r\)). The execution of this two-line program can be represented
as a deduction:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
{Execution of \(r \rightarrow 2\), followed immediately by execution
of \(r \rightarrow r + 3\)} logically entails that \(r = 5\) in the
immediately resulting state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the case of Turing-machine programs, Turing developed a detailed
logical notation for expressing all such deductions (Turing 1936).</p>

<p>
(In fact, the successful execution of <em>any</em> string of
instructions can be represented deductively in this
fashion&mdash;Kripke has not drawn attention to a feature special to
computation. The instructions do not need to be ones that a computer
can carry out.)</p>

<p>
The second step of Kripke&rsquo;s argument is to appeal to what he
refers to as <em>Hilbert&rsquo;s thesis</em>: this is the thesis that
the steps of any mathematical argument can be expressed &ldquo;in a
language based on first-order logic (with identity)&rdquo; (Kripke
2013: 81). The practice of calling this claim &ldquo;Hilbert&rsquo;s
thesis&rdquo; originated in Barwise (1977: 41), but it should be noted
that since Hilbert regarded second-order logic as indispensable (see,
e.g., Hilbert &amp; Ackermann 1928: 86), the name
&ldquo;Hilbert&rsquo;s thesis&rdquo; is potentially misleading.</p>

<p>
Applying &ldquo;Hilbert&rsquo;s thesis&rdquo; to Kripke&rsquo;s above
quoted claim that &ldquo;a computation is just another mathematical
deduction&rdquo; (2013: 80) yields:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
every (human) computation can be formalized as a valid deduction
couched in the language of first-order predicate calculus with
identity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Now, applying G&ouml;del&rsquo;s completeness theorem to this yields
in turn:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
every (human) computation is provable in first-order predicate
calculus with identity, in the sense that, given an appropriate
formalization, each step of the computation can be derived from the
instructions (possibly in conjunction with ancillary premises, e.g.,
well-known mathematical premises, or premises concerning numbers that
are supplied to the computer at the start of the computation).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Finally, applying Turing&rsquo;s provability theorem to this
intermediate conclusion yields the Church-Turing thesis:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
every (human) computation can be done by Turing machine.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="TuriStatThes">4.6 Turing on the status of the thesis</h3>

<p>
As
 <a href="#ModeAxioAnal">Section 3.4</a>
 mentioned, Dershowitz and Gurevich have also argued that the
Church-Turing thesis is susceptible to mathematical proof (Dershowitz
&amp; Gurevich 2008). They offer &ldquo;a proof of Church&rsquo;s
Thesis, as G&ouml;del and others suggested may be possible&rdquo;
(2008: 299), and they add:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In a similar way, but with a different set of basic operations, one
can prove Turing&rsquo;s Thesis, &hellip; . (Dershowitz &amp; Gurevich
2008: 299)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yet Turing&rsquo;s own view of the status of his thesis is very
different from that expressed by Kripke, Dershowitz and Gurevich.
According to Turing, his thesis is not susceptible to mathematical
proof. He did not consider either argument I or argument II to be a
mathematical demonstration of his thesis: he asserted that I and II,
and indeed &ldquo;[a]ll arguments which can be given&rdquo; for the
thesis, are</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
fundamentally, appeals to intuition, and for this reason rather
unsatisfactory mathematically. (Turing 1936 [2004: 74])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Indeed, Turing might have regarded &ldquo;Hilbert&rsquo;s
thesis&rdquo; as itself an example of a proposition that can be
justified only by appeals to intuition.</p>

<p>
Turing discussed a thesis closely related to Turing&rsquo;s thesis,
namely <em>for every systematic method there is a corresponding
substitution-puzzle</em> (where &ldquo;substitution-puzzle&rdquo;,
like &ldquo;computable by Turing machine&rdquo;, is a rigorously
defined concept). He said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The statement is &hellip; one which one does not attempt to prove.
Propaganda is more appropriate to it than proof, for its status is
something between a theorem and a definition. (Turing 1954 [2004:
588])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Probably Turing would have taken this remark to apply equally to the
thesis (Turing&rsquo;s thesis) that <em>for every systematic method
there is a corresponding Turing machine</em>.</p>

<p>
Turing also said (in handwritten material published in 2004) that the
phrase &ldquo;systematic method&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
is a phrase which, like many others e.g., &ldquo;vegetable&rdquo; one
understands well enough in the ordinary way. But one can have
difficulties when speaking to greengrocers or microbiologists or when
playing &ldquo;twenty questions&rdquo;. Are rhubarb and tomatoes
vegetables or fruits? Is coal vegetable or mineral? What about coal
gas, marrow, fossilised trees, streptococci, viruses? Has the lettuce
I ate at lunch yet become animal? &hellip; The same sort of difficulty
arises about question c) above [<em>Is there a systematic method by
which I can answer such-and-such questions</em>?]. An ordinary sort of
acquaintance with the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;systematic
method&rdquo; won&rsquo;t do, because one has got to be able to say
quite clearly about any kind of method that might be proposed whether
it is allowable or not. (Turing in Copeland 2004: 590)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here Turing is emphasizing that the term &ldquo;systematic
method&rdquo; is not exact, and so in that respect is like the term
&ldquo;vegetable&rdquo;, and unlike mathematically precise terms such
as &ldquo;&lambda;-definable&rdquo;, &ldquo;Turing-machine
computable&rdquo;, and &ldquo;substitution-puzzle&rdquo;. Kleene
claimed that, since terms like &ldquo;systematic method&rdquo; and
&ldquo;effectively calculable&rdquo; are not exact, theses involving
them cannot be proved (op. cit.). Turing however did not voice a
similar argument (perhaps because he saw a difficulty). The fact that
the term &ldquo;systematic method&rdquo; is inexact is <em>not</em>
enough to show that there could be no mathematically acceptable proof
of a thesis involving the term. Mendelson gave a graphic statement of
this point, writing about what is called above &ldquo;<em>the converse
of Church&rsquo;s thesis</em>&rdquo;
 (<a href="#MeanCompCompTuriThes">Section 1.5</a>):</p>
 
<blockquote>

<p>
The assumption that a proof connecting intuitive and precise
mathematical notions is impossible is patently false. In fact, half of
CT (the &ldquo;easier&rdquo; half), the assertion that all
partial-recursive functions are effectively computable, is
acknowledged to be obvious in all textbooks in recursion theory. A
straightforward argument can be given for it&hellip;. This simple
argument is as clear a proof as I have seen in mathematics, and it is
a proof in spite of the fact that it involves the intuitive notion of
effective computability. (Mendelson 1990: 232&ndash;233)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yet the point that the &ldquo;intuitive&rdquo; nature of some of its
terms does not rule out the thesis&rsquo;s being provable is not to
say that the thesis <em>is</em> provable. If the status of the
Church-Turing thesis is &ldquo;something between a theorem and a
definition&rdquo;, then the definition is presumably Church&rsquo;s
proposal to &ldquo;define the notion &hellip; of an effectively
calculable function&rdquo;
 (<a href="#MeanCompCompTuriThes">Section 1.5</a>)
 and the theorem is Turing&rsquo;s computation theorem
 (<a href="#TuriTheo">Section 4.3.5</a>),
 i.e., that given Turing&rsquo;s account of the essential features of
human computation, Turing&rsquo;s thesis is true. This theorem is
demonstrable, but to prove the thesis itself from the theorem, it
would be necessary to show, with mathematical certainty, that
Turing&rsquo;s account of the essential features of human computation
is correct. So far, no one has done this. Propaganda does seem more
appropriate than proof.</p>

<h2 id="ChurTuriThesLimiMach">5. The Church-Turing Thesis and the Limits of Machines</h2>

<h3 id="TwoDistThes">5.1 Two distinct theses</h3>

<p>
Can the universal Turing machine perfectly simulate the behavior of
<em>each and any</em> machine? The Church-Turing thesis is sometimes
regarded as providing a statement of the logical limits of machinery,
to the effect that the universal Turing machine is the most general
machine possible (and so the answer to the question just posed is
<em>yes</em>.) For example:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
That there exists a most general formulation of machine and that it
leads to a unique set of input-output functions has come to be called
<em>Church&rsquo;s thesis</em>. (Newell 1980: 150)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yet the Church-Turing thesis is a thesis about the extent of
<em>effective</em> methods (therein lies its mathematical importance).
Putting this another way, the thesis concerns what a <em>human
being</em> can achieve when calculating by rote, using paper and
pencil (absent contingencies such as boredom, death, or insufficiency
of paper). What a human rote-worker can achieve, and what a machine
can achieve, may be different.</p>

<p>
Gandy was perhaps the first to distinguish explicitly between
Turing&rsquo;s thesis and the very different proposition that
<em>whatever can be calculated by a machine can be calculated by a
Turing machine</em> (Gandy 1980). Gandy called this proposition
&ldquo;Thesis M&rdquo;. He pointed out that Thesis M is in fact false
in the case of some &ldquo;machines obeying Newtonian
mechanics&rdquo;, where &ldquo;there may be rigid rods of arbitrary
lengths and messengers travelling with arbitrary large
velocities&rdquo; (1980: 145). He also pointed out that Thesis M fails
to apply to what he calls &ldquo;essentially analogue machines&rdquo;
(1980: 125). A most interesting question is whether Thesis M is true
of all <em>discrete</em> (i.e., non-analogue) machines that are
consistent with the <em>actual laws of physics</em>. This question is
discussed in
 <a href="#ChurTuriThesPhys">Section 6.4</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Thesis M is imprecise, since Gandy never explicitly specified quite
what he meant by &ldquo;calculated by a machine&rdquo;. It is useful
to state a more definite proposition that captures the spirit of
Thesis M. This might be called the <em>strong Church-Turing
thesis</em>, but on balance it seems preferable to avoid that name,
since the proposition in question is very different from the
Church-Turing thesis of 1936. The proposition will be called the
&ldquo;maximality thesis&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Some more terminology: A machine \(m\) will be said to
<em>generate</em> (borrowing this word from Turing 1937: 153) a
certain function (e.g., \(x\) squared) if \(m\) can be set up so that,
if \(m\) is presented with any of the function&rsquo;s arguments
(e.g., 4), \(m\) will carry out some sequence of processing steps, at
the end of which \(m\) produces the corresponding value of the
function (16 in the example). <em>Mutatis mutandis</em> for functions
that, like addition, demand more than one argument.</p>

<blockquote id="maximalitythesis">

<p>
<strong>Maximality thesis</strong>:
<br />
All functions that can be generated by machine are effectively
computable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
&ldquo;Effectively computable&rdquo; is a commonly used term: A
function is said to be effectively computable if (and only if) there
is an effective method for obtaining its values. When phrased in terms
of effective computability, the Church-Turing thesis says: All
effectively computable functions are Turing-machine computable.</p>

<p>
Clearly the Church-Turing thesis and the maximality thesis are
different theses.</p>

<h3 id="EquiFall">5.2 The &ldquo;equivalence fallacy&rdquo;</h3>

<p>
A common argument for the maximality thesis, or an equivalent, cites
the fact, noted above, that many different attempts to analyse the
informal notion of computability in precise terms&mdash;attempts by
Turing, Church, Post, Markov, and others&mdash;turned out to be
<em>equivalent</em> to one another, in the sense that each analysis
provably picks out the same class of functions, namely those functions
computable by Turing machines.</p>

<p>
As previously mentioned, this convergence of analyses is often
considered strong evidence for the Church-Turing thesis (this is the
equivalence argument for the
 thesis&mdash;<a href="#InduEquiArgu">Section 4.1</a>).
 Some go further and take this convergence to be evidence also for the
maximality thesis. Newell, for example, presented the convergence of
the analyses given by Turing, Church, Post, Markov, et al., as showing
that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
all attempts to &hellip; formulate &hellip; general notions of
mechanism &hellip; lead to classes of machines that are equivalent in
that they encompass <em>in toto</em> exactly the same set of
input-output functions. (Newell 1980: 150)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The various equivalent analyses, said Newell, constitute a</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
large zoo of different formulations of maximal classes of machines.
(ibid.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Arguably there is a fallacy here. The analyses Newell is discussing
are of the concept of an effective method: The equivalence of the
analyses bears only on the question of the extent of what is
<em>humanly</em> computable, not on the further question whether
functions generatable by <em>machines</em> could extend beyond what is
in principle humanly computable.</p>

<h3 id="WatcOurWord">5.3 Watching our words</h3>

<p>
It may be helpful at this point to survey some standard technical
terminology that could set traps for the unwary.</p>

<h4 id="WordComp">5.3.1 The word &ldquo;computable&rdquo;</h4>

<p>
As already emphasized, when Turing talks about computable numbers, he
is talking about humanly computable numbers. He says: &ldquo;Computing
is normally done by writing certain symbols on paper&rdquo; (1936
[2004: 75])&mdash;and normally done &ldquo;by human clerical labour,
working to fixed rules&rdquo; (1945 [2005: 386]). &ldquo;The
computer&rdquo;, he says, might proceed &ldquo;in such a desultory
manner that he never does more than one step at a sitting&rdquo; (1936
[2004: 79]). The work of the human computer is mechanizable: &ldquo;We
may now construct a machine&rdquo;&mdash;the Turing
machine&mdash;&ldquo;to do the work of this computer&rdquo; (1936
[2004: 77]). See also
 <a href="#SomeKeyRemaTuriChur">Section 7</a>
 for more quotations relating to this crucial point.</p>

<p>
Thus, the various results in &ldquo;On Computable Numbers&rdquo; to
the effect that such-and-such functions are uncomputable are
accordingly about human computers. Turing should not be construed as
intending to state results about the limitations of machinery. Gandy
wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
it is by no means obvious that the limitations described in
 [<a href="#TuriArguI">Section 4.3</a>
 above] apply to mechanical devices; Turing does not claim this.
(Gandy 1988: 84)</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="TwoInstQuot">5.3.2 Two instructive quotations</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>
[C]ertain functions are uncomputable in an absolute sense:
uncomputable even by [Turing machine], and, therefore, uncomputable by
any past, present, or future real machine. (Boolos &amp; Jeffrey 1974:
55)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the technical logical literature, the term &ldquo;computable&rdquo;
is usually used to mean &ldquo;effectively computable&rdquo; (although
not always&mdash;see
 <a href="#BeyoEffe">Section 5.3.3</a>).
 (&ldquo;Effectively computable&rdquo; was defined in
 <a href="#TwoDistThes">Section 5.1</a>.)
 Since Boolos and Jeffrey are using &ldquo;computable&rdquo; to mean
&ldquo;effectively computable&rdquo;, what they are saying in this
quotation comes down to the statement that the functions in question
are <em>not effectively computable</em> by any past, present, or
future real machine&mdash;which is true, since the functions are,
<em>ex hypothesi</em>, <em>not</em> effectively computable. However,
to a casual reader of the literature, this statement (and others like
it) might appear to say more than it in fact does. That a function is
<em>uncomputable</em> (i.e., is effectively uncomputable), by any
past, present, or future real machine, does not entail <em>per se</em>
that the function in question cannot be <em>generated</em> by some
real machine.</p>

<p>
The second quotation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
FORMAL LIMITS OF MACHINE BEHAVIORS &hellip; There are certain
behaviors that are &ldquo;uncomputable&rdquo;&mdash;behaviors for
which <em>no</em> formal specification can be given for a machine that
will exhibit that behavior. The classic example of this sort of
limitation is Turing&rsquo;s famous <em>Halting Problem</em>: can we
give a formal specification for a machine which, when provided with
the description of <em>any</em> other machine together with its
initial state, will &hellip; determine whether or not that machine
will reach its halt state? Turing proved that no such machine can be
specified. (Langton 1989: 12)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
What is proved is that no <em>Turing machine</em> can always
determine, when provided with the description of <em>any</em> Turing
machine together with its initial state, whether or not that machine
will reach its halt state. Turing certainly proved nothing entailing
that it is impossible to specify a machine <em>of some sort or
other</em> that can do what Langton describes. Thus, the
considerations Langton presents do not impose any general formal
limits on machine behaviors&mdash;only on the behaviors of Turing
machines. Yet the quotation gives a different impression. (In passing,
it is worth pointing out that although the Halting Problem is very
commonly attributed to Turing, as Langton does here, Turing did not in
fact formulate it. The Halting Problem originated with Davis in the
early 1950s (Davis 1958: 70).)</p>

<h4 id="BeyoEffe">5.3.3 Beyond effective</h4>

<p>
Some authors use phrases such as &ldquo;computation in a broad
sense&rdquo;, or simply &ldquo;computation&rdquo;, to refer to
computation of a type that potentially transcends effective
computation (e.g., Doyle 2002; MacLennan 2003; Shagrir &amp; Pitowsky
2003; Siegelmann 2003; Andr&eacute;ka, N&eacute;meti, &amp;
N&eacute;meti 2009; Copeland &amp; Shagrir 2019).</p>

<p>
Doyle, for instance, suggested that <em>equilibrating systems</em>
with discrete spectra (e.g., molecules or other quantum many-body
systems) may illustrate a concept of computation that is wider than
effective computation. Since &ldquo;equilibrating can be so easily,
reproducibly, and mindlessly accomplished&rdquo;, Doyle said, we may
&ldquo;take the operation of equilibrating&rdquo; to be a
computational operation, even if the functions computable in principle
using Turing-machine operations <em>plus</em> equilibrating include
functions that are not computable by an unaided Turing machine (Doyle
2002: 519).</p>

<h4 id="WordMech">5.3.4 The word &ldquo;mechanical&rdquo;</h4>

<p>
There is a world of difference between the technical and everyday
meanings of &ldquo;mechanical&rdquo;. In the technical literature,
&ldquo;mechanical&rdquo; and &ldquo;effective&rdquo; are usually used
interchangeably: A &ldquo;mechanical&rdquo; procedure is simply an
effective procedure. Gandy 1988 outlines the history of this use of
the word &ldquo;mechanical&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Statements like the following occur in the literature:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Turing proposed that a certain class of abstract machines [Turing
machines] could perform any &ldquo;mechanical&rdquo; computing
procedure. (Mendelson 1964: 229)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This could be mistaken for Thesis M. However, &ldquo;mechanical&rdquo;
is here being used in its technical sense, and the statement is
nothing more than the Church-Turing thesis:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Turing proposed that a certain class of abstract machines could
perform any effective computing procedure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The technical usage of &ldquo;mechanical&rdquo; has a tendency to
obscure the conceptual possibility that not all machine-generatable
functions are Turing-machine computable. The question &ldquo;Can a
<em>machine</em> implement a procedure that is not mechanical?&rdquo;
may appear self-answering&mdash;yet this is what is being asked if
Thesis M and the maximality thesis are questioned.</p>

<h3 id="StroMaxiThes">5.4 The strong maximality thesis</h3>

<p>
The maximality thesis has two interpretations, depending whether the
phrase &ldquo;can be generated by machine&rdquo; is taken in the sense
of &ldquo;can be generated by a machine conforming to the physical
laws of the actual world&rdquo; (the weak form of the thesis), or in a
sense that quantifies over <em>all</em> machines, irrespective of
conformity to the actual laws of physics (the strong form). (The
strong-weak terminology reflects the fact that the strong form entails
the weak, but not vice versa.)</p>

<p>
The weak form will be discussed in
 <a href="#ChurTuriThesPhys">Section 6.4</a>.
 The strong form is known to be false. This can be shown by giving an
example of a notional machine that is capable of generating a function
that is not effectively computable. A single example will be provided
here; further examples may be found in Andr&eacute;ka et al. 2009,
Davies 2001, Hogarth 1994, Pitowsky 1990, Siegelmann 2003, and other
papers mentioned below.</p>

<h4 id="AcceTuriMach">5.4.1 Accelerating Turing machines</h4>

<p>
Accelerating Turing machines (ATMs) are exactly like standard Turing
machines except that their speed of operation accelerates as the
computation proceeds (Stewart 1991; Copeland 1998a,b, 2002a; Copeland
&amp; Shagrir 2011). An ATM performs the second operation called for
by its program in half the time taken to perform the first, the third
in half the time taken to perform the second, and so on.</p>

<p>
If the time taken to perform the first operation is called one
&ldquo;moment&rdquo;, then the second operation is performed in half a
moment, the third operation in quarter of a moment, and so on.
Since</p> 
\[ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \ldots + \frac{1}{2n} + \frac{1}{2n+1} + \ldots \le 1, \]

<p>
an ATM is able to perform infinitely many operations in two moments of
operating time. This enables ATMs to generate functions that cannot be
computed by any standard Turing machine (and so, by the Church-Turing
thesis, these functions are not effectively computable).</p>

<p>
One example of such a function is the <em>halting function \(h\)</em>.
\(h(n) = 1\) if the \(n\)th Turing machine halts, and \(h(n) = 0\) if
the \(n\)th Turing machine runs on endlessly. It is well known that no
standard Turing machine can compute this function (Davis 1958); but an
ATM can produce any of the function&rsquo;s values in a finite period
of time.</p>

<p>
When computing \(h(n)\), the ATM&rsquo;s first step is write
&ldquo;0&rdquo; on a square of the tape called the answer square
(\(A\)). The ATM then proceeds to simulate the actions of the \(n\)th
Turing machine. If the ATM finds that the \(n\)th machine halts, then
the ATM goes on to erase the &ldquo;0&rdquo; it previously wrote on
\(A\), replacing this by &ldquo;1&rdquo;. If, on the other hand, the
\(n\)th machine does not halt, the ATM never returns to square \(A\)
to erase the &ldquo;0&rdquo; originally written there. Either way,
once two moments of operating time have elapsed, \(A\) contains the
value \(h(n)\) (Copeland 1998a).</p>

<p>
This notional machine is a counterexample to the strong maximality
thesis.</p>

<h2 id="ModeVersChurTuriThes">6. Modern Versions of the Church-Turing Thesis</h2>

<h3 id="AlgoVers">6.1 The algorithmic version</h3>

<p>
In modern computer science, algorithms and effective procedures are
associated not primarily with humans but with machines. Accordingly,
many computer science textbooks formulate the Church-Turing thesis
without mentioning human computers (e.g., Hopcroft &amp; Ullman 1979;
Lewis &amp; Papadimitriou 1981). This is despite the fact that the
concept of human computation lay at the heart of Turing&rsquo;s and
Church&rsquo;s analyses.</p>

<p>
The variety of algorithms studied by modern computer science eclipses
the field as it was in Turing&rsquo;s day. There are now parallel
algorithms, distributed algorithms, interactive algorithms, analog
algorithms, hybrid algorithms, quantum algorithms, enzymatic
algorithms, bacterial foraging algorithms, slime-mold algorithms and
more (see e.g., Gurevich 2012; Copeland &amp; Shagrir 2019). The
universal Turing machine cannot even perform the atomic steps of
algorithms carried out by, e.g., a parallel system where every cell
updates simultaneously (in contrast to the serial Turing machine), or
an enzymatic system (where the atomic steps involve operations such as
selective enzyme binding).</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, the universal Turing machine is still able to
<em>calculate</em> the behavior of parallel systems and enzymematic
systems. The <em>algorithmic version of the Church-Turing thesis</em>
states that this is true of <em>every</em> algorithmic system. Thus
Lewis and Papadimitriou said: &ldquo;we take the Turing machine to be
a precise formal equivalent of the intuitive notion of
&lsquo;algorithm&rsquo;&rdquo; (1981: 223). David Harel gave the
following (famous) formulation of the algorithmic version of the
thesis:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
any algorithmic problem for which we can find an algorithm that can be
programmed in some programming language, <em>any</em> language,
&hellip; is also solvable by a Turing machine. This statement is one
version of the so-called Church/Turing thesis. (Harel 1992: 233)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Given the extent to which the concept of an algorithm has evolved
since the 1930s&mdash;from the step-by-step labors of human computers
to the growth of slime mold&mdash;interesting questions arise. Will
the concept continue to evolve? What are the limits, if any, on this
evolution? Could the concept evolve in such that a way that the
algorithmic version of the Church-Turing thesis is no longer
universally true? Returning to Doyle&rsquo;s suggestions about
equilibrating systems (in
 <a href="#BeyoEffe">Section 5.3.3</a>),
 Doyle&rsquo;s claim is essentially that the operation of
equilibrating could reasonably be regarded as a basic step of some
effective procedures or algorithms&mdash;<em>whether or not</em> the
resulting algorithms satisfy the algorithmic version of the
Church-Turing thesis. (See Copeland &amp; Shagrir 2019 for further
discussion.)</p>

<p>
In summary, the algorithmic version of the Church-Turing thesis is
broader than the original thesis, in that Church and Turing considered
essentially only a single type of algorithm, effective step-by-step
calculations on paper. The algorithmic version is also perhaps less
secure than the original thesis.</p>

<h3 id="CompCompExteChurTuriThes">6.2 Computational complexity: the Extended Church-Turing thesis</h3>

<p>
The Turing machine now holds a central place not only in computability
theory but also in complexity theory. Quantum computation researchers
Bernstein and Vazirani say:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Just as the theory of computability has its foundations in the
Church-Turing thesis, computational complexity theory rests upon a
modern strengthening of this thesis. (Bernstein &amp; Vazirani 1997:
1411)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There are in fact two different complexity-theoretic versions of the
Church-Turing thesis in the modern computer science literature. Both
are referred to as the &ldquo;Extended Church-Turing thesis&rdquo;.
The first was presented by Yao in 2003:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The <em>Extended Church-Turing Thesis (ECT)</em> makes the &hellip;
assertion that the Turing machine model is also as efficient as any
computing device can be. That is, if a function is computable by some
hardware device in time \(T(n)\) for input of size \(n\), then it is
computable by a Turing machine in time \((T(n))^k\) for some fixed
\(k\) (dependent on the problem). (Yao 2003: 100&ndash;101)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yao points out that ECT has a powerful implication:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
at least in principle, to make future computers more efficient, one
only needs to focus on improving the implementation technology of
present-day computer designs. (2003: 101)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Unlike the original Church-Turing thesis (whose status is
&ldquo;something between&rdquo; a theorem and a definition) ECT is
neither a logico-mathematical theorem nor a definition. If it is true,
then its truth is a consequence of the laws of physics&mdash;and it
might not be true. (Although it is trivial if, contrary to a standard
but unproved assumption in computer science, P = NP.)</p>

<p>
The second complexity-theoretic version of the thesis involves the
concept of a <em>probabilistic Turing machine</em> (due to Rabin &amp;
Scott 1959). Vazirani and Aharonov state the thesis:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[T]he extended Church-Turing thesis &hellip; asserts that any
reasonable computational model can be simulated efficiently by the
standard model of classical computation, namely, a probabilistic
Turing machine. (Aharonov &amp; Vazirani 2013: 329)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These two related theses differ considerably from the original
Church-Turing thesis, not least in that both extended theses are
<em>empirical</em> hypotheses. Moreover, there is ongoing debate as to
whether quantum computers in fact falsify these theses. (For an
introduction to this debate see Copeland &amp; Shagrir 2019, and for a
more detailed treatment see Aharonov &amp; Vazirani 2013.)</p>

<h3 id="BraiSimuChurTuriThes">6.3 Brain simulation and the Church-Turing thesis</h3>

<p>
It is sometimes said that the Church-Turing thesis has implications
concerning the scope of computational simulation. For example, Searle
writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Can the operations of the brain be simulated on a digital computer?
&hellip; The answer seems to me &hellip; demonstrably
&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; &hellip; That is, naturally interpreted, the
question means: Is there some description of the brain such that under
that description you could do a computational simulation of the
operations of the brain. But given Church&rsquo;s thesis that anything
that can be given a precise enough characterization as a set of steps
can be simulated on a digital computer, it follows trivially that the
question has an affirmative answer. (Searle 1992: 200)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Another example:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
we can depend on there being a Turing machine that captures the
functional relations of the brain,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
for so long as</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
these relations between input and output are functionally well-behaved
enough to be describable by &hellip; mathematical relationships
&hellip; we know that some specific version of a Turing machine will
be able to mimic them. (Guttenplan 1994: 595)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Andr&eacute;ka, N&eacute;meti and N&eacute;meti state a more general
thesis about the power of Turing machines to simulate other
systems:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[T]he Physical Church-Turing Thesis &hellip; is the conjecture that
whatever physical computing device (in the broader sense) or physical
thought-experiment will be designed by any future civilization, it
will always be simulateable by a Turing machine. (Andr&eacute;ka,
N&eacute;meti, &amp; N&eacute;meti 2009: 500)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Andr&eacute;ka, N&eacute;meti, and N&eacute;meti even say that the
thesis they state here &ldquo;was formulated and generally accepted in
the 1930s&rdquo; (ibid.).</p>

<p>
Yet it was <em>not</em> a thesis about the simulation of physical
systems that Church and Turing formulated in the 1930s, but rather a
completely different thesis concerning human computation&mdash;and it
was the latter thesis that became generally accepted during the 1930s
and 1940s.</p>

<p>
It certainly muddies the waters to call a thesis about simulation
&ldquo;Church&rsquo;s thesis&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Church-Turing
thesis&rdquo;, because the arguments that Church and Turing used to
support their actual theses go no way at all towards supporting the
theses set out in the several quotations above. Nevertheless, what can
be termed the &ldquo;Simulation thesis&rdquo; has its place in the
present catalogue of modern forms of the Church-Turing thesis:</p>

<blockquote id="simultationthesis">

<p>
<strong>Simulation thesis</strong>:
<br />
Any system whose operations can be characterized as a set of steps
(Searle) or whose input-output relations are describable by
mathematical relationships (Guttenplan) can be simulated by a Turing
machine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If the Simulation thesis is intended to cover all possible systems
then it is surely false, since Doyle&rsquo;s envisaged equilibrating
systems falsify it
 (<a href="#BeyoEffe">Section 5.3.3</a>).
 If, on the other hand, the thesis is intended to cover only actual
physical systems, including brains, then the Simulation thesis is,
like the Extended Church-Turing thesis, an <em>empirical</em>
thesis&mdash;and so is very different from Turing&rsquo;s thesis and
Church&rsquo;s thesis. The truth of the &ldquo;actual physical
systems&rdquo; version of the Simulation thesis depends on the laws of
physics.</p>

<p>
One potential objection that any upholder of the Simulation thesis
will need to confront parallels a difficulty that Gandy raised for
Thesis M
 (<a href="#TwoDistThes">Section 5.1</a>).
 Physical systems that are not discrete&mdash;such as Gandy&rsquo;s
&ldquo;essentially analogue machines&rdquo;&mdash;appear to falsify
the Simulation thesis, since the variables of a system with continuous
dynamics take arbitrary real numbers as their values, whereas a Turing
machine is restricted to <em>computable</em> real numbers, and so
cannot fully simulate the continuous system.</p>

<p>
This brings the discussion squarely to one of the most interesting
topics in the area, so-called &ldquo;physical versions&rdquo; of the
Church-Turing thesis.</p>

<h3 id="ChurTuriThesPhys">6.4 The Church-Turing thesis and physics</h3>

<h4 id="DeutWolfThes">6.4.1 The Deutsch-Wolfram thesis</h4>

<p>
In 1985, Wolfram formulated a thesis that he described as &ldquo;a
physical form of the Church-Turing hypothesis&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[U]niversal computers are as powerful in their computational
capacities as any physically realizable system can be, so that they
can simulate any physical system. (Wolfram 1985: 735)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Deutsch (who laid the foundations of quantum computation)
independently stated a similar thesis, again in 1985, and also
described it as a &ldquo;physical version&rdquo; of the Church-Turing
thesis:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I can now state the physical version of the Church-Turing principle:
&ldquo;Every finitely realizable physical system can be perfectly
simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite
means&rdquo;. This formulation is both better defined and more
physical than Turing&rsquo;s own way of expressing it. (Deutsch 1985:
99)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This thesis is certainly &ldquo;more physical&rdquo; than
Turing&rsquo;s thesis. It is, however, a completely <em>different</em>
claim from Turing&rsquo;s own, so it is potentially confusing to
present it as a &ldquo;better defined&rdquo; version of what Turing
said. As already emphasized, Turing was talking about <em>effective
methods</em>, whereas the theses presented by Deutsch and Wolfram
concern all (finitely realizable) physical systems&mdash;no matter
whether or not the system&rsquo;s activity is effective.</p>

<p>
In the wake of this early work by Deutsch and Wolfram, the phrases
&ldquo;physical form of the Church-Turing thesis&rdquo;,
&ldquo;physical version of the Church-Turing thesis&rdquo;&mdash;and
even &ldquo;<em>the</em> physical Church-Turing
thesis&rdquo;&mdash;are now quite common in the current literature.
However, such terms are probably better avoided, since these physical
theses are very distant from Turing&rsquo;s thesis and Church&rsquo;s
thesis.</p>

<p>
In his 1985 paper, Deutsch went on to point out that if the
description &ldquo;a universal model computing machine operating by
finite means&rdquo; is replaced in his physical thesis by &ldquo;a
universal Turing machine&rdquo;, then the result:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Every finitely realizable physical system can be perfectly simulated
by a universal Turing machine</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
is not true. His reason for saying so is the point discussed at the
end of
 <a href="#BraiSimuChurTuriThes">Section 6.3</a>,
 concerning non-discrete physical systems. Deutsch argued that a
universal Turing machine &ldquo;cannot perfectly simulate any
classical dynamical system&rdquo;, since &ldquo;[o]wing to the
continuity of classical dynamics, the possible states of a classical
system necessarily form a continuum&rdquo;, whereas the universal
Turing machine is a discrete system (Deutsch 1985: 100). Deutsch then
went on to introduce the important concept of a universal quantum
computer, saying (but without proof) that this is &ldquo;capable of
perfectly simulating every finite, realizable physical system&rdquo;
(1985: 102).</p>

<p>
The following formulation differs in its details from both
Wolfram&rsquo;s and Deutsch&rsquo;s theses, but arguably captures the
spirit of both. In view of the Deutsch-Gandy point about continuous
systems, the idea of perfect simulation is replaced by the concept of
simulation <em>to any desired degree of accuracy</em>:</p>

<blockquote id="deutschwolframthesis">

<p>
<strong>Deutsch-Wolfram Thesis</strong>:
<br />
Every finite physical system can be simulated to any specified degree
of accuracy by a universal Turing machine. (Copeland &amp; Shagrir
2019)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Related physical theses were advanced by Earman 1986, Pour-El and
Richards 1989, Pitowsky 1990, Blum et al. 1998, and others. The
Deutsch-Wolfram thesis is closely related to Gandy&rsquo;s Thesis M,
and to the weak maximality thesis
 (<a href="#StroMaxiThes">Section 5.4</a>).
 In fact the Deutsch-Wolfram thesis entails the latter (but not vice
versa, since the maximality thesis concerns only <em>machines</em>,
whereas the Deutsch-Wolfram thesis concerns the behavior of
<em>all</em> finite physical systems&mdash;although any who think that
every finite physical system is a computing machine will disagree; see
e.g., Pitowsky 1990).</p>

<p>
Is the Deutsch-Wolfram thesis true? This is an open question (Copeland
&amp; Shagrir 2020)&mdash;so too for the weak maximality thesis. One
focus of debate is whether physical <em>randomness</em>, if it exists,
falsifies these theses (Calude et al. 2010; Calude &amp; Svozil 2008;
Copeland 2000). But even in the case of non-random systems,
speculation stretches back over at least six decades that there may be
real physical processes (and so, potentially, machine-operations)
whose behavior is neither computable nor approximable by a universal
Turing machine. See, for example, Scarpellini 1963, Pour-El and
Richards 1979, 1981, Kreisel 1967, 1974, 1982, Geroch and Hartle 1986,
Pitowsky 1990, Stannett 1990, da Costa and Doria 1991, 1994, Hogarth
1994, Siegelmann and Sontag 1994, Copeland and Sylvan 1999, Kieu 2004,
2006 (see Other Internet Resources), Penrose 1994, 2011, 2016.</p>

<p>
To select, by way of example, just one paper from this list: Pour-El
and Richards showed in their 1981 article that a system evolving from
computable initial conditions in accordance with the familiar
three-dimensional wave equation is capable of exhibiting behavior that
falsifies the Deutsch-Wolfram thesis. However, now as then, it is an
open question whether these initial conditions are physically
possible.</p>

<h4 id="GandArgu">6.4.2 The &ldquo;Gandy argument&rdquo;</h4>

<p>
Gandy (1980) gave a profound discussion of whether there could be
deterministic, discrete systems whose behavior cannot be calculated by
a universal Turing machine. The now famous &ldquo;Gandy
argument&rdquo; aims to show that, given certain reasonable physical
assumptions, the behavior of <em>every</em> discrete deterministic
mechanism is calculable by Turing machine. In some respects, the Gandy
argument resembles and extends Turing&rsquo;s argument I, and Gandy
regarded it as an improved and more general alternative to
Turing&rsquo;s I (1980: 145). He emphasized that (unlike
Turing&rsquo;s argument), his argument takes &ldquo;parallel working
into account&rdquo; (1980: 124&ndash;5); and it is this that accounts
for much of the additional complexity of Gandy&rsquo;s analysis as
compared to Turing&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>
Gandy viewed the conclusion of his argument (that the behavior of
every discrete deterministic mechanism is calculable by Turing
machine) as relatively <em>a priori</em>, provable on the basis of a
set-theoretic derivation that makes very general physical assumptions
(namely, the four axioms mentioned in
 <a href="#ModeAxioAnal">Section 3.4</a>).
 These assumptions include, for instance, a lower bound on the
dimensions of a mechanism&rsquo;s components, and an upper bound on
the speed of propagation of effects and signals. (The argument aims to
cover only mechanisms obeying the principles of Relativity.) Gandy
expressed his various physical assumptions set-theoretically, by means
of precise axioms, which he called Principles I &ndash; IV. Principle
III, for example, captures the idea that there is a bound on the
number of types of basic parts (atoms) from which the states of the
machine are uniquely assembled; and Principle IV&mdash;which Gandy
called the &ldquo;principle of local causation&rdquo;&mdash;captures
the idea that each state-transition must be determined by the
<em>local environments</em> of the parts of the mechanism that change
in the transition.</p>

<p>
Gandy was very clear that his argument does not apply to continuous
systems&mdash;analogue machines, as he called them&mdash;and
non-relativistic systems. (Extracts from unpublished work by Gandy, in
which he attempted to develop a companion argument for analogue
machines, are included in Copeland &amp; Shagrir 2007.) However, the
scope of the Gandy argument is also limited in other ways, not noted
by Gandy himself. For example, some asynchronous algorithms fall
outside the scope of Gandy&rsquo;s principles (Gurevich 2012; Copeland
&amp; Shagrir 2007). Gurevich concludes that Gandy has not shown
&ldquo;that his axioms are satisfied by all discrete mechanical
devices&rdquo;, and Shagrir says there is no &ldquo;basis for claiming
that Gandy characterized finite machine computation&rdquo; (Gurevich
2012: 36, Shagrir 2002: 234). It will be useful to give some examples
of discrete deterministic systems that, in one way or another, evade
Gandy&rsquo;s conclusion that the behavior of every such system is
calculable by Turing machine.</p>

<p>
First, it is relatively trivial that mechanisms <em>satisfying</em>
Gandy&rsquo;s four principles may nevertheless produce uncomputable
output from computable input if embedded in a universe whose physical
laws have Turing-uncomputability built into them, e.g., via a temporal
variable (Copeland &amp; Shagrir 2007). Moreover, some asynchronous
algorithms fall outside the scope of Gandy&rsquo;s principles
(Gurevich 2012; Copeland &amp; Shagrir 2007). Second, certain
(notional) discrete deterministic &ldquo;relativistic computers&rdquo;
also fall outside the scope of Gandy&rsquo;s principles. Relativistic
computers were described in a 1987 lecture by Pitowsky (Pitowsky
1990), and in Hogarth 1994 and Etesi &amp; N&eacute;meti 2002. The
idea is outlined in the entry on
 <a href="../computation-physicalsystems/">computation in physical systems</a>;
 for further discussion see Shagrir and Pitowsky 2003, Copeland and
Shagrir 2020.</p>

<p>
The N&eacute;meti relativistic computer makes use of gravitational
time-dilation effects in order to compute (in a broad sense) a
function that provably cannot be computed by a universal Turing
machine (e.g., the halting function). N&eacute;meti and his colleagues
emphasize that the N&eacute;meti computer is &ldquo;not in conflict
with presently accepted scientific principles&rdquo; and that, in
particular, &ldquo;the principles of quantum mechanics are not
violated&rdquo;. They suggest moreover that humans might &ldquo;even
build&rdquo; a relativistic computer &ldquo;sometime in the
future&rdquo; (Andr&eacute;ka, N&eacute;meti, &amp; N&eacute;meti
2009: 501).</p>

<p>
According to Gandy,</p>

<ol type="1">

<li>&ldquo;A discrete deterministic mechanical device satisfies
principles I-IV&rdquo; (he called this &ldquo;Thesis P&rdquo;; Gandy
1980: 126), and</li>

<li>&ldquo;What can be calculated by a device satisfying principles
I-IV is computable&rdquo; (he labelled this
&ldquo;Theorem&rdquo;).</li>
</ol>

<p>
1 and 2 together yield: <em>What can be calculated by a discrete
deterministic mechanical device is (Turing-machine)
computable</em>.</p>

<p>
However, the N&eacute;meti computer is a discrete, deterministic
mechanical device, and yet is able to calculate functions that are not
Turing-machine computable. That is to say, relativistic computers are
counterexamples to Gandy&rsquo;s Thesis P. In brief, the reason for
this is that the sense of &ldquo;deterministic&rdquo; implicitly
specified in Gandy&rsquo;s Principles
(&ldquo;Gandy-deterministic&rdquo;) is narrower than the intuitive
sense of &ldquo;deterministic&rdquo;, where a deterministic system is
one obeying laws that involve no randomness or stochasticity.
Relativistic computers are deterministic but not Gandy-deterministic.
(For a fuller discussion, see Copeland, Shagrir, &amp; Sprevak
2018.)</p>

<p>
In conclusion, Gandy&rsquo;s analysis has made a considerable
contribution to the current understanding of machine computation. But,
important and illuminating though the Gandy argument is, it certainly
does not settle the question whether the Deutsch-Wolfram thesis is
true.</p>

<h4 id="QuanEffeTotaThes">6.4.3 Quantum effects and the &ldquo;Total&rdquo; thesis</h4>

<p>
There is a stronger form of the
 <a href="#deutschwolframthesis">Deutsch-Wolfram thesis</a>,
 dubbed the &ldquo;Total thesis&rdquo; in Copeland and Shagrir
2019.</p>

<blockquote id="totalthesis">

<p>
<strong>The Total Thesis</strong>:
<br />
Every physical aspect of the behavior of any physical system can be
calculated (to any specified degree of accuracy) by a universal Turing
machine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Logically, the Total thesis is counter-exampled by the universal
Turing machine itself (assuming that the universal machine, with its
indefinitely long tape, is at least a notional physical system; see
Copeland &amp; Shagrir 2020 for discussion of this assumption). This
is because there is no algorithm for calculating whether a universal
Turing machine halts on every given input&mdash;i.e., there is no
algorithm for calculating that aspect of the machine&rsquo;s behavior.
The question remains, however, whether the Total thesis is infringed
by any systems that are &ldquo;more physical&rdquo; than the universal
machine. (Notice that such systems, if any exist, do not necessarily
also infringe the Deutsch-Wolfram thesis, since it is possible that,
even though answers to certain physical questions about the system are
uncomputable, the system is nevertheless able to be simulated by a
Turing machine.)</p>

<p>
Interestingly, recent work in condensed matter quantum physics
indicates that&mdash;possibly&mdash;quantum many-body systems could
infringe the Total thesis. In 2012, Eisert, M&uuml;ller and Gogolin
established the surprising result that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the very natural physical problem of determining whether certain
outcome sequences cannot occur in repeated quantum measurements is
undecidable, even though the same problem for classical measurements
is readily decidable. (Eisert, M&uuml;ller &amp; Gogolin 2012:
260501.1)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This was a curtain-raiser to a series of dramatic results about the
uncomputability of quantum phase transitions, by Cubitt and his group
(Cubitt, Perez-Garcia, &amp; Wolf 2015; Bausch, Cubitt, Lucia, &amp;
Perez-Garcia 2020; Bausch, Cubitt, &amp; Watson 2021). These results
concern the &ldquo;spectral gap&rdquo;, an important determinant of
the properties of a substance. A quantum many-body system is said to
be &ldquo;gapped&rdquo; if the system has a well-defined next least
energy-level above the system&rsquo;s ground energy-level, and is said
to be &ldquo;gapless&rdquo; otherwise (i.e., if the energy spectrum is
continuous). The &ldquo;spectral gap problem&rdquo; is the problem of
determining whether a given many-body system is gapped or gapless.</p>

<p>
The uncomputability results of Cubitt et al. stem from their discovery
that the halting problem can be encoded in the spectral gap problem.
Deciding whether a model system of the type they have studied is
gapped or gapless, given a description of the local interactions, is
&ldquo;at least as hard as solving the Halting Problem&rdquo; (Bausch,
Cubitt, &amp; Watson 2021: 2). Moreover, this is not just a case of
<em>uncomputability in, uncomputability out</em>. Uncomputability
arises even though the initial conditions are computable (as with the
notional system described in Pour-El and Richards 1981, mentioned in
 <a href="#DeutWolfThes">Section 6.4.1</a>).
 Cubitt et al. emphasize:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the phase diagram is uncomputable even for <em>computable</em> (or
even algebraic) values of its parameter \(\phi\). Indeed, it is
uncomputable at a countably-infinite set of computable (or algebraic)
values of \(\phi\). (Bausch, Cubitt, &amp; Watson 2019: 8)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
However, Cubitt admits that the models used in the proofs are somewhat
artificial:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Whether the results can be extended to more natural models is yet to
be determined. (Cubitt, Perez-Garcia &amp; Wolf 2015: 211)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In short, it is an open&mdash;and fascinating&mdash;question whether
there are realistic physical systems that fail to satisfy the Total
thesis.</p>

<h2 id="SomeKeyRemaTuriChur">7. Some Key Remarks by Turing and Church</h2>

<h3 id="TuriMach">7.1 Turing machines</h3>

<p>
Turing prefaced his first description of a Turing machine with the
words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We may compare a man in the process of computing a &hellip; number to
a machine. (Turing 1936 [2004: 59])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The Turing machine is a model, idealized in certain respects, of a
<em>human being</em> calculating in accordance with an effective
method.</p>

<p>
Wittgenstein put this point in a striking way:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Turing&rsquo;s &ldquo;Machines&rdquo;. These machines are
<em>humans</em> who calculate. (Wittgenstein 1947 [1980: 1096])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is a point that Turing was to emphasize, in various forms, again
and again. For example:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A man provided with paper, pencil, and rubber, and subject to strict
discipline, is in effect a universal machine. (Turing 1948 [2004:
416])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In order to understand Turing&rsquo;s &ldquo;On Computable
Numbers&rdquo; and later texts, it is essential to keep in mind that
when he used the words &ldquo;computer&rdquo;,
&ldquo;computable&rdquo; and &ldquo;computation&rdquo;, he employed
them not in their modern sense as pertaining to machines, but as
pertaining to human calculators. For example:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Computers always spend just as long in writing numbers down and
deciding what to do next as they do in actual multiplications, and it
is just the same with ACE [the Automatic Computing Engine] &hellip;
[T]he ACE will do the work of about 10,000 computers &hellip;
Computers will still be employed on small calculations &hellip;
(Turing 1947 [2004: 387, 391])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Turing&rsquo;s ACE, an early electronic stored-program digital
computer, was built at the National Physical Laboratory, London; a
pilot version&mdash;at the time the fastest functioning computer in
the world&mdash;first ran in 1950, and a commercial model, the DEUCE,
was marketed very successfully by English Electric.</p>

<h3 id="HumaCompMachComp">7.2 Human computation and machine computation</h3>

<p>
The electronic stored-program digital computers for which the
universal Turing machine was a blueprint are, each of them,
computationally equivalent to a Turing machine, and so they too are,
in a sense, models of human beings engaged in computation. Turing
chose to emphasize this when explaining these electronic machines in a
manner suitable for an audience of uninitiates:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The idea behind digital computers may be explained by saying that
these machines are intended to carry out any operations which could be
done by a human computer. (Turing 1950a [2004: 444])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He made the point a little more precisely in the technical document
containing his design for the ACE:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The class of problems capable of solution by the machine [the ACE] can
be defined fairly specifically. They are [a subset of] those problems
which can be solved by human clerical labour, working to fixed rules,
and without understanding. (Turing 1945 [2005: 386])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Turing went on to <em>characterize</em> this subset in terms of the
amount of paper and time available to the human clerk.</p>

<p>
It was presumably because he considered the point to be essential for
understanding the nature of the new electronic machines that he chose
to begin his <em>Programmers&rsquo; Handbook for Manchester Electronic
Computer Mark II</em> with this explanation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Electronic computers are intended to carry out any definite rule of
thumb process which could have been done by a human operator working
in a disciplined but unintelligent manner. (Turing <em>c</em>1950:
1)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It was not some deficiency of imagination that led Turing to model his
L.C.M.s on what could be achieved by a <em>human</em> computer. The
purpose for which he invented the Turing machine demanded it. The
<em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> is the problem of finding a <em>humanly
executable</em> method of a certain sort, and, as was explained
earlier, Turing&rsquo;s aim was to show that there is no such method
in the case of the full first-order predicate calculus.</p>

<h3 id="ChurHumaComp">7.3 Church and the human computer</h3>

<p>
Turing placed the human computer center stage in his 1936 paper. Not
so Church. Church did not mention computation or human computers
explicitly in either of his two groundbreaking papers on the
<em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> (Church 1936a,b). He spoke of &ldquo;effective
calculability&rdquo;, taking it for granted his readers would
understand this term to be referring to <em>human</em> calculation. He
also used the term &ldquo;effective method&rdquo;, again taking it for
granted that readers would understand him to be speaking of a humanly
executable method.</p>

<p>
Church also used the term &ldquo;algorithm&rdquo;, saying</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is clear that for any recursive function of positive integers there
exists an algorithm using which any required particular value of the
function can be effectively calculated. (Church 1936a: 351)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He said further that the notion of effective calculability could be
spelled out as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
by defining a function to be effectively calculable if there exists an
algorithm for the calculation of its values. (Church 1936a: 358)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It was in Church&rsquo;s review of Turing&rsquo;s 1936 paper that he
brought the human computer out of the shadows. He wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[A] human calculator, provided with pencil and paper and explicit
instructions, can be regarded as a kind of Turing machine. It is thus
immediately clear that computability, so defined [i.e., computability
by a Turing machine], can be identified with (especially, is no less
general than) the notion of effectiveness as it appears in certain
mathematical problems &hellip; and in general any problem which
concerns the discovery of an algorithm. (Church 1937a: 43)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="TuriUseMach">7.4 Turing&rsquo;s use of &ldquo;machine&rdquo;</h3>

<p>
It is important to note that, when Turing used the word
&ldquo;machine&rdquo;, he often meant not machine-in-general but, as
we would now say, Turing machine. At one point he explicitly drew
attention to this usage:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The expression &ldquo;machine process&rdquo; of course means one which
could be carried out by the type of machine I was considering [in
&ldquo;On Computable Numbers&rdquo;]. (Turing 1947 [2004:
378&ndash;9])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus when, a few pages later, Turing asserted that &ldquo;machine
processes and rule of thumb processes are synonymous&rdquo; (1947
[2004: 383]), he is to be understood as advancing the Church-Turing
thesis (and its converse), not a version of the maximality thesis.
Unless his intended usage is borne in mind, misunderstanding could
ensue. Especially liable to mislead are statements like the following,
which a casual reader might mistake for a formulation of the
maximality thesis:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The importance of the universal machine is clear. We do not need to
have an infinity of different machines doing different jobs. A single
one will suffice. The engineering problem of producing various
machines for various jobs is replaced by the office work of
&ldquo;programming&rdquo; the universal machine to do these jobs.
(Turing 1948 [2004: 414])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In context it is perfectly clear that these remarks concern machines
equivalent to Turing machines; the passage is embedded in a discussion
of L.C.M.s.</p>

<p>
Whether or not Turing would, if queried, have assented to the weak
maximality thesis is unknown. There is certainly no textual evidence
in favor of the view that he did so assent. The same is true of the
 <a href="#deutschwolframthesis">Deutsch-Wolfram thesis</a>
 and its cognates: there is no textual evidence that Turing would have
assented to any such thesis.</p>

<h3 id="ChurVersTuriThes">7.5 Church&rsquo;s version of Turing&rsquo;s thesis</h3>

<p>
Interestingly, the summary of Turing&rsquo;s account of computability
given by Church in his 1937 review was not entirely correct. Church
said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The author [Turing] proposes as a criterion that an infinite sequence
of digits 0 and 1 be &ldquo;computable&rdquo; that it shall be
possible to devise a computing machine, occupying a finite space and
with working parts of a finite size, which will write down the
sequence to any desired number of terms if allowed to run for a
sufficiently long time. (Church 1937a: 42)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
However, there was no requirement proposed in Turing&rsquo;s 1936
paper that Turing machines occupy &ldquo;a finite space&rdquo; or have
&ldquo;working parts of a finite size&rdquo;. Nor did Turing couch
matters in terms of the machine&rsquo;s writing down &ldquo;any
desired number of terms&rdquo; of the sequence, &ldquo;if allowed to
run for a sufficiently long time&rdquo;. Turing said, on the contrary,
that a sequence is &ldquo;computable if it can be computed by a
circle-free machine&rdquo; (Turing 1936 [2004: 61]); where a machine
is circle-free if it is <em>not</em> one that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
never writes down more than a finite number of symbols [0s and 1s].
(Turing 1936 [2004: 60])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In consequence, Church&rsquo;s version of Turing&rsquo;s thesis is
subtly different from Turing&rsquo;s own:</p>

<blockquote id="churchsturingthesis">

<p>
<strong>Church&rsquo;s Turing&rsquo;s thesis</strong>:
<br />
An infinite sequence of digits is &ldquo;computable&rdquo; if (and
only if) it is possible to devise a computing machine, occupying a
finite space and with working parts of a finite size, that will write
down the sequence to any desired number of terms if allowed to run for
a sufficiently long time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In so far as Church includes these three finiteness requirements
(i.e., that the machine occupy a finite space, have finite-sized
parts, and produce finite numbers of digits), his version of
Turing&rsquo;s thesis can perhaps be said to be &ldquo;more
physical&rdquo; than any of Turing&rsquo;s formulations of the thesis.
Church&rsquo;s finiteness requirements are in some respects
reminiscent of Gandy&rsquo;s idea that the states of a discrete
deterministic calculating machine must be built up iteratively from a
bounded number of types of basic components, the dimensions of which
have a lower bound (see
 <a href="#GandArgu">Section 6.4.2</a>).
 Although, as explained there, Gandy imposes further requirements on a
discrete deterministic calculating machine, and these go far beyond
Church&rsquo;s finiteness requirements.</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding Church&rsquo;s efforts to inject additional physical
realism into the concept of a Turing machine, it is&mdash;as in
Turing&rsquo;s case&mdash;unknown whether Church would, if queried,
have assented to the
 <a href="#deutschwolframthesis">Deutsch-Wolfram thesis</a>
 or any cognate thesis. There seems to be no textual evidence either
way. Church was simply silent about such matters.</p>

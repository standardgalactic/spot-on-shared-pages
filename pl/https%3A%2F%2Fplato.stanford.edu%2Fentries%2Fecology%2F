<p>
Ecology is the scientific discipline that studies interactions between
individual organisms and their environments, including interactions
with both conspecifics and members of other species. Its importance
has been recognized at least since Darwin&rsquo;s publication
of <em>Origin of Species</em>, which categorized ecological interactions
as &ldquo;the struggle for existence&rdquo;. Since then, there has
been an ongoing endeavor to systematize investigations of this
struggle into a scientific discipline. Historically, philosophers paid
little attention to ecology, compared to other scientific disciplines,
yet this has begun to change, as it is becoming increasingly obvious
that examining ecological systems is interesting in itself and can
also provide insights for philosophy of science more generally. This
entry will cover a selection of topics that are internal to ecology,
in the sense that they only exist in an ecological context
 (<a href="#PhilTopiEcol">&sect;2</a>)
 along with a selection of topics that are already discussed in
philosophy of science yet are particularly interesting when examined
from an ecological standpoint.</p>

<h2 id="WhatScieDiscCallEcol">1. What is (the scientific discipline called) Ecology?</h2>

<p>
The term &ldquo;Ecology&rdquo; is attributed to Ernst Haeckel, who
coined it to provide a name for the science of what Darwin called the
&ldquo;Struggle for Existence&rdquo; (Cooper 2003). This struggle was
a focal point of early evolutionary thought as it constituted an
important driving force of evolution by natural selection (Cooper
2003; Justus 2021). Organisms struggled in their environments,
competing over scarce resources. The study of the outcomes of these
struggles eventually developed into Evolutionary Biology, while the
study of the struggles themselves developed into the discipline of
Ecology. As the science of the struggle for existence matured into
&ldquo;Ecology&rdquo; proper, several new struggles emerged, this time
for its practitioners rather than the organisms they studied. These
struggles have shaped the discipline since its beginnings, influencing
the establishment of concepts, methods and epistemic norms
(Elliott-Graves 2019, 2023; Justus 2021; Kingsland 1985 [1995]; Peters
1991).</p>

<p>
The underlying cause of many of these struggles comes from the
complexity of ecological systems. Ecological systems are made up of
numerous diverse species and abiotic factors (e.g., water, nitrogen,
phosphorus etc.), all of which interact dynamically with each other
giving rise to events, phenomena and behaviors that are difficult to
investigate scientifically. Some of the most important of these
difficulties are:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>the fact that ecological phenomena transcend levels, scales and
hierarchies (see
 <a href="#UnitEcolRese">&sect;2.1</a>
 &amp;
 <a href="#Leve">&sect;3.4</a>),</li>
 
<li>data is difficult to obtain and often of poor quality (despite the
best efforts of ecologists) (see
 <a href="#Comp">&sect;3.2</a>
 &amp;
 <a href="#Meth">&sect;3.5</a>),</li>
 
<li>generalizations are contingent and have limited scope (see
 <a href="#Laws">&sect;3.3</a>),</li>
 
<li>the discipline of ecology combines both &ldquo;pure&rdquo; and
&ldquo;applied&rdquo; research traditions, which have different (often
competing) research goals and norms and (see
 <a href="#Cons">&sect;2.4</a>
 &amp;
 <a href="#EcolApplScie">&sect;3.7</a>)</li>
 
<li>epistemic and non-epistemic goals and values coexist in many
research areas, especially those in the applied tradition, where they
are often interwoven with policy-making (see
 <a href="#Cons">&sect;2.4</a>
 &amp;
 <a href="#EcolApplScie">&sect;3.7</a>).</li>
 </ol>

<p>
From a philosophical point of view, these struggles make the
discipline of Ecology particularly interesting. The phenomena
ecologists investigate along with the challenges they face can teach
us valuable lessons about how science, especially the science of
complex systems, works. In addition, philosophical approaches can be
fruitful for ecological research (see for example Diamond 1986; Levins
1966; Odenbaugh 2007; Sarkar 2014a; Trappes et al. 2022). Even though
philosophy of ecology is a relatively new field of research, there are
a great number of topics that are worth discussing. It is impossible
to cover all these topics and to cover them extensively. So, this
entry will provide a brief overview of a selection of topics. It is
important to note that, as this is an entry on <em>philosophy</em> of
ecology, the topics selected for discussion are those that have
established philosophical debates, in addition to their importance for
ecological research. Also, the length of each section should not be
taken as an indication of its importance relative to other topics.
Some topics that are already discussed in other entries in this
encyclopedia (e.g.,
 <a href="../conservation-biology/">conservation biology</a>,
 <a href="../biodiversity/">biodiversity</a>,
 <a href="../levels-org-biology/">levels of organization in biology</a>,
 <a href="../models-science/">models in science</a>) are given briefer overviews.</p>

<p>
Finally, categorizing all these diverse topics is itself a difficult
task, as there are numerous possible ways to divide them and multiple
connections between each topic. In order to maximize the readability
and usefulness of the entry for understanding the philosophy of
ecology, the entry has been organized as follows.
 <a href="#PhilTopiEcol">Section 2</a>,
 titled Philosophical Topics in Ecology, covers the topics originating
in ecological research that have also generated philosophical
interest. These are the novel topics for philosophy, which only came
about because of the study of ecological systems.
 <a href="#PhilScieEcol">Section 3</a>,
 titled Philosophy of Science in Ecology, covers classical issues in
general philosophy of science, which are particularly interesting when
applied to ecology, either because the classical accounts do not apply
to ecological systems or because the investigation of the topic in the
context of ecological systems, has generated novel insights.</p>

<h2 id="PhilTopiEcol">2. Philosophical Topics in Ecology</h2>

<h3 id="UnitEcolRese">2.1 Units of Ecological Research</h3>

<p>
Most discussions of ecology, including ecological textbooks, divide
ecological research in terms of the main &ldquo;ecological unit&rdquo;
the research focuses on (Jax 2006). The three main units are
<em>populations</em>, <em>communities</em>, and <em>ecosystems</em>.
On the one hand, research on all of these units is well established,
as each is associated with a recognized ecological sub-discipline,
with its own research questions, methods and norms. On the other hand,
however, there are residual theoretical issues concerning how to
define each unit, and whether or not all these units are truly
distinct (Odenbaugh 2007; Trombley &amp; Cottenie 2019). The next
three sub-sections address the main conceptual and methodological
issues associated with ecosystems, communities and populations
respectively, and the section concludes with a discussion of
individuals, a topic which is gaining momentum in philosophy of
ecology. It is important to keep in mind that not all ecological
research falls neatly into one of these categories, but straddles more
than one unit (e.g., landscape ecology [Turner &amp; Gardner 2015],
work on metapopulations [Hanski &amp; Simberloff 1997; Millstein 2010]
and community genetics [Antonovics 1992], see also the entry on
 <a href="#Leve">&sect;3.4</a>).</p>
 
<h4 id="Ecos">2.1.1 Ecosystem</h4>

<h5>Concept</h5>

<p>
An ecosystem can be minimally defined as all the organisms in an area
along with the physical environment with which they interact. The
question, and point of contention, is how the parts of an ecosystem
are defined and how they are connected to each other. There are three
main ways to conceptualize ecosystems (Odenbaugh 2007; Raffaelli &amp;
Frid 2010). The first is the Elton-Lindeman view, where ecosystems are
complex systems, i.e., more than the sum of their parts. Here,
populations of organisms and abiotic factors are conceived as parts of
networks with energy flowing between them (as one is consumed by
another). The second is the holistic/system&rsquo;s level conception,
advocated by H.T. Odum, where organisms are completely dispensed with
and the ecosystem is just the energy flows between trophic levels
(Odum 1968). The third is a skeptical approach to ecosystems, either
in the sense that they are too loosely connected to be anything more
than the sum of their parts (see also
 <a href="#Comm">&sect;2.1.2</a>),
 or because various ecosystems are too diverse to have anything in
common, so there is nothing to be gained from studying them as a
special type of entity (see discussion in Odenbaugh 2007). The
ontological status of an ecosystem has some important implications,
such as whether or not an ecosystem can be &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; (see
 <a href="#NatuWildRest">&sect;2.4.1</a>)
 and what constitutes ecosystem &ldquo;function&rdquo; (see
 <a href="#Func">&sect;3.6</a>).</p>
 
<h5>Method</h5>

<p>
Ecosystem ecology emerged as an alternative to community and
population ecology (see
 <a href="#Comm">&sect;2.1.2</a>
 and
 <a href="#Popu">&sect;2.1.3</a>),
 because these approaches only took into account the interactions
between the <em>living</em> components of the system (Odenbaugh 2007).
Ecosystem ecologists stressed the importance of including
<em>abiotic</em> factors into ecological research and models (Odum
1968; Raffaelli &amp; Frid 2010). In order to include all these
additional causal factors, ecosystem models focus on the transfer of
energy between the various trophic levels (e.g., primary producers,
herbivores, carnivores, detritivores) (Raffaelli &amp; Frid 2010).
Ecosystem-level models, such as Ecosystem Network Models tend to be
very rich in detail and constructed for, or at least tailored to a
particular system (see also
 <a href="">&sect;3.5.1</a>).
 The main critiques of these models are that</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>they are system-specific and therefore do not allow the transfer
of knowledge to other systems, and</li>

<li>as they incorporate lots of detailed data, they are prone to
&ldquo;overfitting&rdquo; i.e., including noisy data or errors
(Hitchcock &amp; Sober 2004).</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="Comm">2.1.2 Community</h4>

<h5>Concept</h5>

<p>
The debate concerning the ontological status of communities has deeper
roots than the one about ecosystems. It sits at the heart of a broader
debate about the whole sub-discipline of community ecology, namely
whether it is a worthwhile approach to studying ecological systems
(Lawton 1999; Roughgarden 2009; Simberloff 2004). Communities can be
conceived as:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>mere <em>aggregates</em>, if their parts are not interdependent
and thus do not merit any special ontological status,</li>

<li><em>wholes</em>, i.e., more than just the sum of their parts, if
causal relations exist between their parts, or</li>

<li><em>individuals</em>, if their parts are so closely connected that
they display a level of internal structure (Odenbaugh 2007).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Each of these views has had influential ecologists as advocates (Eliot
2011; Odenbaugh 2007; Roughgarden 2009). For example, Henry Gleason
did not believe that communities were anything more than the sum of
their parts. George Evelyn Hutchinson believed that communities
displayed interactions that included feedback loops, which resulted in
self-regulation, and hence should be thought of as wholes. Finally,
Frederic Clements viewed communities as being so deeply interconnected
that they should be understood as <em>superorganisms</em>,
ontologically equivalent to individual organisms. Historians and
philosophers of science have also engaged with the concept of an
ecological community, providing in-depth discussions of the
ontological status and viability of various community concepts along
with their historical and sociological evolution (Colyvan, Linquist,
et al. 2009; Eliot 2011; Lean 2018; Linquist 2015; Sterelny 2006).
While there is no consensus, the prevailing view is that while
communities are not superorganisms/individuals, they possess enough
internal structure, or clear boundaries to count as wholes (Lean 2018;
Sterelny 2006, see also discussion in Odenbaugh 2007. Millstein [2018]
supports the communities as individuals view).</p>

<h5>Method</h5>

<p>
Research in community ecology focuses on the interactions between
populations within a community. The most important of these are
<em>competition</em>, <em>predation</em>, <em>mutualism</em> and
<em>parasitism</em>. Community ecology is also the framework for many
of the landmark concepts and ideas in ecological research, including
the majority of concepts that are thought of as typically ecological,
such as the <em>niche</em>, <em>trophic levels</em>, <em>keystone
species</em> and <em>ecological engineering</em> (Ricklefs &amp;
Miller 2000). Of all the approaches in ecology, community ecology is
probably the one with the greatest focus on experimentation (Lubchenco
&amp; Read 1991). In fact, many ideas in community ecology were
established through landmark experiments, such as Paine&rsquo;s
intertidal experiments that led to the concept of a keystone species,
while others, such as Gause&rsquo;s competition experiments, became
renowned for demonstrating that theoretical principles could manifest
in real-world communities. Models also play an important role in
community ecology, the most notable of which are the Lotka-Volterra
models of competition and predation (Knuuttila &amp; Loettgers 2017;
Weisberg 2007b). The advantages and disadvantages of these models are
similar to the ones used in population ecology, discussed next (see
also
 <a href="#Meth">&sect;3.5</a>).</p>
 
<h4 id="Popu">2.1.3 Population</h4>

<h5>Concept</h5>

<p>
Ecologists typically define a population as a group of interbreeding
organisms or organisms of the same species, found in the same space or
area at the same time (Rockwood 2015). The position that populations
are real units in nature is less controversial than the equivalent
claims for communities and ecosystems (Cooper &amp; Hurd 2019;
Millstein 2009; but see Gannett 2003). Still, philosophers disagree on
a number of points regarding the nature of populations. An important
contribution to this literature is a series of papers by Roberta
Millstein (2009, 2013, 2014), where she argues that the ambiguity in
the way the term population is used by ecologists and evolutionary
biologists is problematic, as it leads to confusion and can hamper
progress in biological research. Instead, she proposes the <em>causal
interactionist population concept</em> (CIPC), for both ecological and
evolutionary populations. Here, a population is defined as:</p>

at least two conspecific organisms that, over the course of a
generation, are actually engaged in survival or reproductive
interactions, or both. (Millstein 2014: 750)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
An important dimension of Millstein&rsquo;s conception is that
populations are viewed as <em>individuals</em>, after Ghiselin and
Hull&rsquo;s conception of species as individuals
 (<a href="#Comm">&sect;2.1.2</a>,
 see also
 <a href="../species/">species, &sect;2.2</a>).
 Critiques of the CIPC include arguments against
populations-as-individuals, on the basis that the ecological
conception of population differs significantly from its evolutionary
counterpart and that the populations-as-individuals account applies
only to the latter (Cooper &amp; Hurd 2019), along with arguments for
a more pluralistic account of populations (Stegenga 2010).</p>

<h5>Method</h5>

<p>
Population ecology is as old as ecology itself. Indeed, on one view,
ecology only became a true scientific discipline, when mathematical
models from demography and physics were applied to ecological
populations (Evans et al. 2013; Kingsland 1985 [1995]; see also
 <a href="#ScieStatEcol">&sect;3.1</a>).
 Research in population ecology focuses on population dynamics,
especially demographic processes (such as density dependent growth,
Allee effects) and the effects of migration (Rockwood 2015). Models in
population ecology tend to be simple and general, in the sense that
they contain few parameters and apply to many different populations.
The main critique of these models is that they are not very realistic,
as they leave out factors that are idiosyncratic to some populations
(Evans et al. 2013; see also
 <a href="#Mode">&sect;3.5.1</a>).
 For example, competition models that are developed for animals do not
apply that well to plant populations, as they do not take into account
the importance of abiotic factors for plant competition (Berger et al.
2008).</p>

<h4 id="IndiOrga">2.1.4 Individual (Organism)</h4>

<p>
When compared to the other ecological levels, the level of individual
(organisms) has received less attention. Most models and experiments
focus on groups rather than individuals, and when individuals do make
an appearance (e.g., in individual-based models), they are usually
aggregates or averages of the entire population and largely
homogeneous with each other (Kaiser &amp; Trappes 2021; Trappes 2022).
There are good epistemic reasons for this. Variation between
individuals is often an indication of error in data collection or
interpretation and can add unnecessary complexity to the model or
experiment. Homogenizing across individuals can thus reduce
observation and measurement errors and can allows scientists to
distinguish between genuine causal factors and mere noise
(Elliott-Graves 2019, 2023).</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, there is a contingent of ecologists who advocate for
greater focus on individuals, especially on individual differences.
Some sub-disciplines, such as Behavioral Ecology and Physiological
Ecology, focus explicitly on individuals. Moreover, in 1972, Joan
Roughgarden argued that differences between individuals within a
population explain the phenomenon of &ldquo;niche width&rdquo; i.e.,
the variety of resources a population exploits, which in turn has
implications for the resilience of the population (Roughgarden 1972).
Individual-Based models, imported from economics (see
 <a href="#Func">&sect;3.6</a>),
 highlighted the importance of focusing on individuals, even though
the individuals themselves are largely homogeneous and differ only on
one or two dimensions (Justus 2014). More recently, there has been a
concerted effort to incorporate individual differences in models and
experiments in numerous pars of ecological research (Moran et al.
2017; Mutwill et al. 2021; Nagel et al. 2021; Schwarz et al. 2021).
This has led to important insights. For example, dominant meerkat
females temporarily evict subordinate females from the group, leading
to a higher level of spontaneous miscarriages and a suppression of
their competitors&rsquo; reproduction (Trappes et al. 2022; Andrew
Young, et al., 2006).</p>

<p>
Note: The discussion of individuals in the context of philosophy of
ecology is not related to the debate surrounding biological
individuality (see
 <a href="../biology-individual/">biological individuals</a>).
 The latter concept centers on individuals in a predominantly
evolutionary context. For a comparison between the two debates see
(Kaiser &amp; Trappes 2021).</p>

<h3 id="Nich">2.2 The Niche</h3>

<p>
Perhaps the most important distinctly ecological concept is that of
the &ldquo;niche&rdquo;. As is the case with many other ecological
concepts, the niche is notoriously difficult to define. A number of
influential ecologists have formulated conceptualizations of the
niche, including Grinnell, Elton, Hutchinson and MacArthur.
Categorizing these concepts is far from straightforward, as they
overlap in some ways but differ in others.
 <a href="#ConcNich">Section 2.2.1</a>,
 outlines three historically important conceptualizations of the
niche (the niche as <em>habitat</em>, the <em>functional</em> niche
and the niche as an <em>n-dimensional hyperspace</em>). 
 <a href="#AgaiNich">Section 2.2.2</a>,
 examines the role of the niche in ecological theorizing along with
some critiques of the niche concepts and framework.</p>

<h4 id="ConcNich">2.2.1 Conceptualizing the Niche</h4>

<h5>Habitat</h5>

<p>
Historically, the idea of the niche can be dated back to Darwin, yet
the first lengthy treatment of the niche concept is found in the work
of Joseph Grinnell, who used the term to describe the aspects of the
environment, biotic and abiotic, that a species occupied (Gaffney
1975; Pocheville 2015). There are two central characteristics of the
Grinnellian niche. The first is that each niche can only be occupied
by one species, that is, two species in the same ecosystem cannot
occupy the exact same niche. Second, new niches can arise as habitats
change, and existing niches can become <em>vacant</em>, as species
become locally extinct, providing the space and adaptive pressure for
other species to occupy them. This gives the Grinnellian niche
explanatory power, as properties of niches can explain certain
species&rsquo; phenotypic adaptations: organisms adapt to fill vacant
niches (see discussion in Justus 2021).</p>

<h5>Function</h5>

<p>
A different conception of the niche was proposed by Charles Elton.
Elton noticed that while there is a lot of variation in terms of the
species that populate different habitats, there are some important
similarities in terms of trophic level: most communities have
herbivores, carnivores and detritivores. His conception of the niche
focuses on the function of the organism within a community, i.e., its
place in the biotic environment and its relationships with other
organisms, such as its prey and predators. Elton thought of the niche
as analogous to an occupation, famously stating:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
When an ecologist says &ldquo;there goes a badger&rdquo; he should
include in his thoughts some definite idea of the animal&rsquo;s place
in the community to which it belongs, just as if he had said
&ldquo;there goes the vicar&rdquo;. (Elton 1927: 64)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Elton&rsquo;s functional conception of the niche also accommodates the
idea of vacant niches, which can be occupied by organisms that adapt,
migrate or invade a community.</p>

<h5>N-dimensional hyperspace</h5>

<p>
About 20 years after Elton, G.E. Hutchinson proposed yet another
conception of a niche that bore some similarities but also some
important differences to both previous conceptions. The basic idea is
this: for any particular species, imagine a space, where every
environmental factor that affects it (biotic and abiotic) is
represented on an axis. The number of relevant factors (<em>n</em>)
determine how many axes the space will have. The space within these
axes, where a species can persist (i.e., has positive fitness) is its
<em>fundamental niche</em>. Within this space is a smaller one which
delineates where the species actually exists&mdash;this is its
<em>realized niche</em> (Chase &amp; Leibold 2003).</p>

<h4 id="AgaiNich">2.2.2 Against the Niche</h4>

<p>
An important feature of the niche concept is that it helps to explain
the dynamics and structure of ecological communities. It does so
through the principle of competitive exclusion (CEP), which states
that complete competitors, i.e., species with identical niches, cannot
coexist (Bausman 2019; Griesemer 1992). So, the closer the competition
is between species the higher the incentive to diversify one&rsquo;s
niche or migrate. For some, competition theory, inclusive of the CEP,
is the cornerstone of ecology and its relationship with evolutionary
biology, as it is the basis for understanding community dynamics and
the evolutionary structure of communities (Griesemer 1992; Kingsland
1985 [1995]).</p>

<p>
The popularity of the niche concept is extensive but not ubiquitous.
Some ecologists believe that the niche/competition framework is
insufficient for explaining community-level ecological phenomena. For
example, the CEP has been criticized as untestable and not
scientifically useful (see discussion in Justus 2019). An important
landmark in this debate is Stephen Hubbell&rsquo;s <em>neutral
theory</em> of community structure, where differences between species,
are neutral, i.e., irrelevant to their success within a community
(Hubbell 2001). Instead, community structure is affected by drift
(random birth and death), dispersal, and speciation. In other words,
niches do not influence the relative abundances of each species in a
community, so they have little import in the study of community
structure. The neutral theory itself is quite controversial, as is its
exact relationship with the niche/competition framework (Bausman 2019;
Chase &amp; Leibold 2003; Justus 2021). The neutral theory can be seen
as an alternative to the competition framework, or as a <em>null
hypothesis</em>, i.e., a hypothesis that must be shown to be false
before an alternative (here, a competition hypothesis) is accepted
(Bausman 2019). Some ecologists have attempted to reconcile the two
alternatives into one theory that integrates aspects of both
approaches, (see for example Chesson 2000; Vellend 2010).</p>

<p>
A different criticism comes from Justus (2019; 2021), who argues that
the niche concept is superfluous, on the grounds that none of the
existing niche concepts are actually useful in ecological research, as
they do not consistently explain or predict community structure in the
real world. Moreover, attempts to combine existing niche concepts in
order to overcome the deficiencies of individual definitions are
doomed to fail, because such combinations become too abstract and
devoid of causal information to adequately represent real ecological
communities, let alone predict community structure.</p>

<h3 id="BiolInva">2.3 Biological Invasions</h3>

<p>
The recognition that species outside their native range can cause
problems for indigenous species dates back to Darwin, who realized
that in each habitat species have friends and enemies which affect
their population&rsquo;s growth, and when a was introduced to a new
habitat without enemies, it could take over at the expense of the
native species (Reichard &amp; White 2003). After Darwin, there was
little interest in the problems associated with invasive species,
until the publication of Charles Elton&rsquo;s book <em>The Ecology of
Invasions by Animals and Plants</em> in 1958. Elton thought that
invasive species were exceedingly problematic and his main aim was to
provide a framework for the conservation of native communities (Davis
2006). Since then, there has been a rapid increase in the research on
biological invasions, which has resulted in the establishment of
invasion biology as a sub-discipline of ecology, with research
programs and journals dedicated to research on the concepts, methods,
impacts and management of biological invaders (Enders et al. 2020;
Reichard &amp; White, 2003).</p>

<h4 id="DefiBiolInva">2.3.1 Defining biological Invaders</h4>

<p>
Defining a biological invader is not an easy task. Terms to describe
species outside their native range include &ldquo;invasive&rdquo;,
&ldquo;alien&rdquo;, &ldquo;exotic&rdquo;, &ldquo;introduced&rdquo;,
&ldquo;non-native&rdquo;, &ldquo;adventive&rdquo;,
&ldquo;neophyte&rdquo;, &ldquo;naturalized&rdquo;,
&ldquo;immigrant&rdquo;, &ldquo;weed&rdquo;, &ldquo;noxious&rdquo;,
along with compound terms such as &ldquo;invasive alien&rdquo;,
&ldquo;non-native invader&rdquo; and so on (Colautti &amp; Richardson
2009; Pysek 1995; Ashley Young &amp; Larson 2011). Each of these terms
has its own set of assumptions and implications that preclude a
universally acceptable classification. For example, if we were to
define &ldquo;invasive&rdquo; as a species that was widespread outside
its native range, this classification includes many species typically
classified as invasive. However, a significant number of cases would
be much less obvious. First, what counts as a species&rsquo; native
range? Migration (including human-assisted migration) of plants and
animals has occurred for millennia, but not all migrations have
resulted in invasion. For many widespread species, we might not even
be sure about their native range (Courchamp, Hulme, &amp; Py&scaron;ek
2020). Second, what counts as widespread? Some species become
established and spread yet do not pose threats to native ecosystems.
Should these count as invaders or not? Third, some species become
&ldquo;integrated&rdquo; into new ecosystems and removing them can
actually create problems for native species (Singer &amp; Parmesan
2018). Should these species count as invasive?</p>

<p>
The debate surrounding the definition of biological invaders has
gained momentum, resulting in heated exchanges between prominent
invasion biologists (and some philosophers) (Frank et al. 2019;
Guia&#351;u &amp; Tindale 2023; Ricciardi &amp; Ryan 2018; Richardson
&amp; Ricciardi 2013; Sagoff 2018; Young &amp; Larson 2011). The
debate centers on the effect of value-laden terminology on perceptions
of non-native species and their management. On one side of the debate
are those who believe that the terminology used to described
non-native species (such as alien or invasive) is xenophobic and leads
to biases in the research, resource allocation and management of
biological invasions (Davis, Chew, et al. 2011; Guia&#351;u &amp;
Tindale 2023; Sagoff 2018). They argue that the perceived threat of
invasives is often overblown, for example because few extinctions can
be attributed to the effect of biological invasions (Gurevitch &amp;
Padilla 2004), while in some cases their effect can even be positive,
as they can mitigate other anthropogenic disturbances, such as soil
erosion, while their presence can increase biodiversity or introduce
novel (and sometimes stabilizing) interactions in biological
communities (Davis, Chew, et al. 2011). In addition, efforts to manage
biological invasions are often unnecessary, as they are unlikely to
succeed despite incurring significant economics costs, and in some
cases can even cause additional harm to native communities,
exacerbating existing problems or even creating new ones (Davis, Chew,
et al. 2011; Guia&#351;u &amp; Tindale 2023; Thiengo et al. 2007).</p>

<p>
The opposing view is that, occasional benefits notwithstanding, the
overall effect of invasive species is overwhelmingly negative
(Richardson &amp; Ricciardi 2013). Proponents of this view cite
numerous cases, especially island communities, where invaders have
decimated indigenous species, and disrupted ecosystem functioning
(Simberloff 2011). Even in cases where the effects of invaders are not
yet obvious, either because they are not yet widely spread in a new
area, or because they do not compete with certain native species,
there is always the possibility that a non-native species will pose a
threat to a native ecosystem in the future, a possibility that is
becoming increasingly more likely due to the effects of climate change
(Sax &amp; Brown 2000; Simberloff 2014). The rhetoric on this side of
the debate is also quite strong, as scientists in this camp charge
their opponents with espousing &ldquo;invasive species
denialism&rdquo;, i.e., adopting a non-scientific or pseudoscientific
approach to biological invasions, by focusing on the value-leadenness
of terminology, cherry picking examples of positive effects of
invaders and ignoring or downplaying the evidence of negative effects
of invasions (Frank et al. 2019; Ricciardi &amp; Ryan 2018).</p>

<h4 id="CausBiolInva">2.3.2 The Causes of Biological Invasions</h4>

<p>
Another important question in invasion biology is: what causes some
invasions to succeed and others to fail? The search for the causes of
biological invasions has its own history and tensions. There are two
main research traditions on the cause of invasions. In the first
tradition, which grew out of population ecology, the causes of
invasion were to be found at the level of the invader. The idea is
that invasions succeed when invaders possess a combination of traits
which allow them to establish and spread in new areas, by outcompeting
or otherwise disturbing native species. For example, (Grotkopp et al.
2002) identified small seed mass, short generation times and a high
relative growth rate as the characteristics of successful invasions in
the genus <em>Pinus</em>. Species which have a fast growth strategy
have increased productivity which results in larger overall biomass.
Together with a greater efficiency in dispersal, this confers a
competitive advantage to species in a new area, at the expense of the
native species. That is, faster growth, in terms of individual and
population level biomass, can decrease the available resources for
other plants in the same habitat.</p>

<p>
The second tradition identifies the causes of invasion at the level of
the community or ecosystem, i.e., by focusing on characteristics that
allow communities to resist invasion. The idea is that each community
erects a series of barriers which invaders have to overcome in order
to succeed in invading. A popular example of an ecosystem-level
barrier to invasion was biodiversity, the idea being that a more
diverse community would be more robust to perturbation (Kennedy et al.
2002). While this descendant of the diversity-stability hypothesis has
largely been abandoned (McCann 2000), it has been replaced by more
nuanced accounts. For example, (Davis, Grime, &amp; Thompson 2000)
argue that diverse communities, which occupy more of an
environment&rsquo;s niches are less likely to have fluctuating
resources as they use them up more consistently, thus decreasing the
availability of resources to invaders.</p>

<p>
Neither research tradition has succeeded in producing a generalized
theory of invasion that can be used for prediction and management
(Catford et al. 2009; Hayes &amp; Barry 2007; Reichard &amp; White
2003). Despite attempts to integrate the two research traditions, a
unified theory of invasion biology has yet to be developed. This is an
ongoing thorn in the side of some invasion biologists, as they worry
that invasion biology cannot progress without such a theory (Blackburn
et al. 2011; Enders et al. 2020). However, some ecologists and
philosophers view a unified theory of invasion biology as unlikely, as
biological invasions are exceedingly complex and context dependent
(Jeschke et al. 2012; Val&eacute;ry et al. 2013). The particular
causal factors and dynamic interactions that give rise to each
invasion are idiosyncratic, possibly even unique, so even if we find a
general theory, it will have so many exceptions that it will not be
very useful for predicting and managing invasions (Elliott-Graves
2016) (see also
 <a href="#Laws">&sect;3.3</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="Cons">2.4 Conservation</h3>

<p>
Conservation biology focuses on protecting parts of the world that are
deemed ecologically important. It can be considered a sub-discipline
of ecology, or a distinct field of research, with aims that sometimes
diverge from traditional or &ldquo;fundamental&rdquo; ecology (Justus
&amp; Wakil 2021; Linquist 2008, see also
 <a href="#EcolApplScie">&sect;3.7</a>).
 The next two sections examine two important issues in
conservation biology, the ideas of <em>nature</em> and
<em>wilderness</em> and their relationship to <em>restoration</em> and
the notion of <em>biodiversity</em>. Other important topics in
conservation biology include the extent to which it is
ethically-driven, which is outlined in
 <a href="#EcolApplScie">section 3.7</a>,
 along with debates concerning the best approaches and methods for
determining and implementing conservation strategies. The latter issue
is covered extensively in
 (<a href="../conservation-biology/">conservation biology</a>)
 and will not be discussed in this entry.</p>

<h4 id="NatuWildRest">2.4.1 Nature, Wilderness and Restoration</h4>

<p>
One set of issues in the philosophy of conservation biology concerns
the &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; of conservation, i.e., how we should
conceptualize the goals of conservation. There are ongoing debates
about how we should understand the concepts of &ldquo;nature&rdquo;
and &ldquo;wilderness&rdquo;, for example, whether humans and human
activity are part of nature, and when a habitat can be considered
&ldquo;wild&rdquo; (Higgs 2003; Woods 2017). These disagreements are
not merely semantic, as they can affect actual strategies for
conservation. An important and ongoing discussion concerns the
<em>historical fidelity</em> of restoration projects. One view, put
forward by the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER), amongst
others, is that restoration should not just aim to &ldquo;mend&rdquo;
damaged ecosystems but that it should aim to restore ecosystem
functions by returning ecosystems to some past state, i.e., so that
this function is performed by the same entities, that did so in the
past (SER in Desjardins 2015; Garson 2014). An alternative view is
that historical fidelity is difficult to identify and measure (which
is the relevant past of an ecosystem? How far into the past should we
go? How can we be sure about the species compositions in past versions
of ecosystems? Etc.), and should therefore be replaced with other,
more fundamental goals (Sarkar 2011, 2014a, 2014b). Those responding
to this critique of historical fidelity concede that there are
conceptual and practical difficulties with historical fidelity, yet
argue that it is still valuable as a goal for conservation (Desjardins
2015; Garson 2014).</p>

<p>
A related debate concerns the notion of &ldquo;ecosystem
health&rdquo;. We could think of the aim (or at least one aim) of
conservation biology as the promotion and maintenance of healthy
ecosystems. However, there is little agreement about what whether
ecosystems can be the bearers of health (McShane 2004). The three main
views in the debate are:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>that ecosystems can literally be healthy and unhealthy (McShane
2004),</li>

<li>that ecosystem health is a metaphorical concept, akin to that of a
&ldquo;healthy economy&rdquo; (Callicott 1995)</li>

<li>that ecosystems are not the types of entities that can be healthy
or unhealthy, e.g., because they are not organisms, because they are
merely social constructs, or because the appropriate notion of
ecosystem function does not provide norms of performance that are
necessary for a notion of health (see discussion in Odenbaugh 2010,
McShane 2004 and
 <a href="#Func">&sect;3.6</a>).</li>
 </ol>

<h4 id="Biod">2.4.2 Biodiversity</h4>

<p>
What should conservation biology conserve? The usual answer to this
question is &ldquo;biodiversity&rdquo; (Justus 2021; Maclaurin &amp;
Sterelny 2008; Santana 2014; Sarkar 2002; Sarkar &amp; Margules 2002,
see also
 <a href="../biodiversity/">biodiversity</a>
 and
 <a href="../conservation-biology/">conservation biology</a>).
 There is general agreement that biodiversity is extremely important,
yet much less agreement on what exactly biodiversity means (Santana
2014; Maclaurin &amp; Sterelny 2008). On a superficial level,
biodiversity simply means the &ldquo;variability among living
organisms&rdquo; in various ecosystems (United Nations summit
definition, found in Santana 2014, p. 763. However, this superficial
definition is not particularly helpful, because it is akin to saying
that biodiversity includes &ldquo;everything in biology&rdquo; (Sarkar
2002). Such a concept is neither easily operationalizable, nor does it
help us determine what should be conserved (Santana 2014; Sarkar
2002).</p>

<p>
There are two general approaches to defining biodiversity. The first
is to define it <em>explicitly</em>, i.e., to identify a set of
characteristics that jointly pick out the concept. The most common
explicit definition of biodiversity is in terms of <em>species
richness</em>, often augmented with another characteristic (Maclaurin
&amp; Sterelny 2008). Put simply, species richness is just the number
of species in a certain area. Measures of species richness usually
include another dimension, such as abundance (the number of
individuals in a population), evenness (the commonness or rarity of a
species), phenotypic disparity (how varied traits are in a group of
species) or evolutionary disparity (how far away species are in their
evolutionary trajectories) (Santana 2014).</p>

<p>
The second approach is to define biodiversity <em>implicitly</em>, by
specifying a set of rules or axioms,
&ldquo;place-prioritization&rdquo; algorithms, from which the concept
can be determined (Sarkar 2002). The basic idea is to identify which
parts of the world to preserve, when we only have a limited budget. We
start with a list of biodiversity surrogates (such as species, traits,
environmental parameters, along with various compositions of species,
subsets of species, and environmental parameters). We then carve up an
area into &ldquo;cells&rdquo; (of varying sizes) and identify which
surrogates appear in each cell. The algorithms can be used to
determine the smallest number of cells that need to be protected, so
that all surrogates are represented or, given a number of cells that
can be protected the algorithms can determine which cells should be
protected so as to maximize the number of surrogates that are
represented. So, biodiversity is defined as what the algorithms
determine should be prioritized.</p>

<p>
Another view is to dispense with the concept entirely. Santana (2014,
2017) has argued that none of the existing definitions of biodiversity
are viable. Against species richness, he argues that it does not
capture all aspects of biological value. He points out that not all
areas or species are of equal value. For example, old growth forests
or rare biomes might be worth preserving even if they have lower
biodiversity than others. In contrast, some species such as certain
viruses are much less valuable and ought to be eliminated. He also
argues that many conceptions of biodiversity include other concepts,
such as stability which are controversial; he worries that these
connections can undermine conservation efforts. All in all, he argues
that the concept of biodiversity does more harm than good and should
therefore be eliminated. Only then will we able to focus on what
really matters, i.e., biological value.</p>

<h2 id="PhilScieEcol">3. Philosophy of Science in Ecology</h2>

<h3 id="ScieStatEcol">3.1 The Scientific Status of Ecology</h3>

<p>
Ecologists display a striking degree of introspection regarding the
quality of ecological research and the overall scientific status of
their discipline. This is perhaps due to the historical development of
Ecology, where the introduction of mathematical models from physics
was viewed by many as an important step in the establishment of a
truly scientific discipline (Kingsland 1985 [1995]). Throughout its
history, ecologists have been at pains to distinguish their discipline
from natural history, which they viewed as a merely descriptive
endeavor, devoid of general theories and predictive power (Johnson
2007; Kingsland 1985 [1995]). These worries continue in the present.
There are a number of publications which lament the state of research
in ecology or its sub-disciplines because of alleged theoretical and
empirical failures, lack of progress, lack of unification across
methods or sub-disciplines, etc. (Courchamp, Dunne, et al. 2015;
Houlahan et al. 2017; Lawton 1996; Marquet et al. 2014; Peters 1991;
Scheiner &amp; Willig 2011; Shrader-Frechette &amp; McCoy 1993;
Val&eacute;ry et al. 2013).</p>

<p>
On the one hand, a certain level of introspection and concern about
the quality of research is an indicator of good practice, as it helps
to maintain standards and improve methods in a discipline. On the
other hand, however, too much concern can be counterproductive, as it
can undermine the efforts of practicing scientists. Indeed, the
importance placed on unificatory theories, predictive power and
mathematical models is sometimes described as &ldquo;physics
envy&rdquo; (Egler 1986; Kingsland 1985 [1995: 234]; McIntosh 1987;
Shrader-Frechette &amp; McCoy 1993: 34). Moreover, these theoretical
concerns can be disproportionately damaging to some sub-disciplines,
where generalization and prediction are particularly difficult (see
 <a href="#Comp">&sect;3.2</a>).
 For example, there have been calls to eliminate invasion biology as
an autonomous sub-discipline (Val&eacute;ry et al. 2013), along with
calls to decrease the funding allocated to applied ecological research
in favor of fundamental (or pure) ecological research (see
 <a href="#Func">&sect;3.6</a>
 for a discussion of the distinction) (Courchamp, Dunne et al.
2015).</p>

<h3 id="Comp">3.2 Complexity</h3>

<p>
Complexity in ecology is a thorny topic, as there is no uncontested
definition of complexity, neither within, nor outside ecology
(Elliott-Graves, 2023). When ecologists talk about complexity, they
are usually referring to one or more characteristics of ecological
systems, that contribute to complexity. These characteristics include
having <em>multiple parts</em> (Levins 1966; Miller &amp; Page 2007),
<em>interaction</em> between parts (in terms of the <em>number</em> of
interactions (connectance) and the <em>strength</em> of these
interactions (interaction strength) (Odenbaugh 2011; Pimm 1991),
<em>non-linearity</em> or <em>feedback</em> (a change in one factor
can result in a disproportional change in the behavior of the system)
and <em>path dependence</em> (a system's later states depend on their
previous states) (Levin 1998).</p>

<h4 id="CharEcolComp">3.2.1 Characteristics of Ecological Complexity</h4>

<p>
A particularly important characteristic of complexity, both within and
outside ecology, is that their behavior amounts to more than the sum
of their parts (Mitchell 2003; Simon 1962). In other words, they have
<em>emergent</em> properties. Some emergent properties are considered
to be features of complexity in their own right. For example,
<em>hierarchical organization</em> of a system contributes to
<em>self-organization</em> and <em>causal autonomy</em> i.e., the
ability of the system to regulate its own states and creating and
maintaining the processes that enable it to function (Levin 2002,
2005). Emergence is important in broader terms, as it forms the basis
for an anti-reductionist approach to complex systems research
(Mitchell 2009). The idea is that because these properties are more
than the sum of their parts, investigating complex systems should
occur at the levels that these behaviors occur, rather than at lower
levels.</p>

<p>
A characteristic of complexity which is particularly relevant to
ecological systems is <em>heterogeneity</em> (Elliott-Graves 2018;
Levins 1966; Matthewson 2011). Put simply, systems are heterogeneous
when their parts are not homogeneous, but vary in one or more ways.
Consider a suit of chainmail armor: it is made up of many interacting
metal rings, yet the rings are homogeneous, as each ring is almost
identical to the rest. In contrast, ecological systems display
<em>intra-system heterogeneity</em>: each system is made up of many
different species and abiotic components. In fact, there are even
differences between individuals of the same species, in terms of how
they behave (Elliott-Graves 2018, 2023; Levins 1966). Ecological
systems also display <em>inter-system heterogeneity</em>, i.e., there
are differences between systems (Elliott-Graves 2018, 2023; Matthewson
2011). For example, a forest and a grassland ecosystem may have
similar trophic levels, but they are made up of very different types
of species. Even two ecosystems of the same &ldquo;type&rdquo; e.g.,
two forests, often have very different species and/or display very
different dynamics and interactions.</p>

<h4 id="EffeComp">3.2.2 The Effects of Complexity</h4>

<p>
Complexity is important in two very different ways for ecology. The
first is positive, in the sense that it explains some of
ecology&rsquo;s fundamental questions: how are ecosystems possible?
How can they persist in the face of countless internal and external
disturbances? The idea is that complex communities (i.e., communities
that have diverse/heterogeneous interacting parts) are more stable,
that is able to adapt to changes such as fires, new competitors, new
predators or sudden climatic changes, without falling apart. This view
was famously disputed by Robert May (1973), who used mathematical
models to show that we should expect complex communities to be
<em>less</em> stable. The debate continues to this day, with
ecologists and philosophers of ecology using increasingly refined
notions of complexity, diversity and stability to argue for or against
the &ldquo;diversity-stability&rdquo; hypothesis (McCann 2000;
Odenbaugh 2011). Despite their differences regarding this hypothesis,
however, ecologists seem to have reached a certain consensus, agreeing
that complexity is a feature of healthy and mature ecological systems,
even though such systems may be susceptible to particular disturbances
(Hooper et al. 2005; Loreau et al. 2001; McCann 2000; Parrott
2010).</p>

<p>
Complexity is also important in a negative sense, as it hinders the
study of ecological systems, creating difficulties for the collection
of data, the setup and interpretation of experiments, the construction
and interpretation of models, the predictability of system dynamics
and consequently the feasibility and success of interventions. The
complexity of ecological systems, especially in the form of dynamic
interactions, non-linearity, feedback and heterogeneity, make each
ecological phenomenon or system idiosyncratic, which hinders the
construction of generalizations and predictions. In other words, the
knowledge scientists acquire from studying one ecological system does
not transfer to other systems or to the same system in the future
(Elliott-Graves 2023; Levins 1966; Matthewson 2011). For example,
explanations of community structures that were based on the keystone
species concept have subsequently been proven to be false, as it turns
out that keystone species do not behave in the same way across
different systems (Cottee-Jones &amp; Whittaker 2012). Similarly,
predictions can fail when underlying patterns change or break. For
example, species distribution models (SDMs) are often used to predict
the range of a species colonizing a new area, by projecting variables
of the species&rsquo; native niche to the new area (Sobek-Swant et al.
2012). However, climate change can render these predictions
inaccurate, e.g., unexpected higher temperatures or fewer extreme cold
events can increase a species&rsquo; range to regions that it would
normally not be able to colonize (Cuddington et al. 2018).</p>

<h3 id="Laws">3.3 Laws</h3>

<p>
A related issue is that of laws. In traditional accounts of philosophy
of science, uncovering laws of nature is an important goal of
scientific research and a hallmark of a mature, successful scientific
discipline (Colyvan &amp; Ginzburg 2003; Mitchell 2000). There are
numerous and differing accounts of how to define laws of nature (see
 <a href="../laws-of-nature/">laws of nature</a>).
 A simple reconstruction of the traditional view of laws is the
following: laws of nature are generalizations that are necessarily
true (i.e., not accidental), and hold in all space and time without
any exceptions (Mitchell 2000). Candidates for lawhood in ecology have
included the principle of competitive exclusion, density-dependent
population regulation, equilibrium theory of island biogeography,
optimality models, supply-side ecology and metapopulation theory and
allometric scaling laws (Beck 1997; Justus 2021; Raerinne 2011).</p>

<p>
The problem is that in the biological sphere, most generalizations
&ldquo;fail&rdquo; on all three counts. For a start, biological
entities and their interactions are contingent on evolutionary
history, i.e., they are historical accidents, so any generalizations
about them or their causal relations cannot be necessary truths
(Mitchell 2003). Second, the complexity of biological systems means
that generalizations are far from exceptionless, but only hold in
certain contexts (see
 <a href="#Comp">&sect;3.2</a>).
 Third, generalizations tend to apply to subsets of organisms, so they
are far from universal. All of the candidates for lawhood mentioned in
the previous paragraph have been overturned, due to the emergence of
empirical counterexamples (Beck 1997; Raerinne 2011).</p>

<p>
There are roughly three ways for how to interpret these
&ldquo;failures&rdquo;, in ecology. The first is that these are indeed
failures, and a discipline without laws is not truly scientific
(Lawton 1999; Peters 1991). The second view is to concede that ecology
does not have laws in the traditional sense, but that this does not
diminish the scientific status of the discipline (Beck 1997;
Shrader-Frechette &amp; McCoy 1993) (see
 <a href="#ScieStatEcol">&sect;3.1.</a>).
 The third view is to argue that if, on this definition of laws of
nature, ecology does not have laws, then the fault lies with the
definition of laws, as it is unnecessarily strong (Colyvan &amp;
Ginzburg 2003; Linquist et al. 2016). The classic dichotomies
(necessary/accidental, universal/contingent) are not useful for
practicing scientists, as the point of generalizations is that they
help scientists achieve various goals, such as explaining and
predicting natural phenomena or intervening on the world. In this
context, the most important characteristic of ecological laws is that
they are invariant, stable or resilient, i.e., they persist for long
enough, in certain contexts to be detected and to be used to make
predictions (though what exactly long enough etc. means is also a
matter of debate) (Colyvan &amp; Ginzburg 2003; Linquist et al. 2016.
For a more detailed discussion of laws in ecology see Elliott-Graves
2023). Finally, Raerinne (Raerinne 2011, 2013, 2015) merges aspects of
all three views, arguing that the aspect of laws that we should care
about is the fact that they are generalizations that are invariant and
extrapolatable. If ecological generalizations are invariant, then they
are sufficient for generating explanations, so whether or not they are
laws is beside the question.</p>

<h3 id="Leve">3.4 Levels</h3>

<p>
Debates and discussions about levels in philosophy of science are
quite complicated, as they bring together ontological, epistemic and
methodological issues from philosophy and many different sciences
(Brooks et al. 2021). The issues concerning levels in ecology can be
situated within the more general discussion of organizational levels
in biology
 (<a href="../levels-org-biology/">levels of organization in biology</a>).
 The main view that is relevant for ecology is the traditional
&ldquo;layer-cake&rdquo;
 account.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 Historically, this view held sway in philosophy of science for many
years and is still prevalent in many sciences (including ecology)
 (<a href="../levels-org-biology/">levels of organization in biology</a>).
 Roughly, it states that the world is organized hierarchically, and
each level of nature corresponds to a science that studies it. Things
become complicated when we are trying to determine what counts as a
level, whether all levels are equal or whether some are more
fundamental or should be prioritized in science. Thus, for example,
reductionists tend to prioritize the smaller levels, while
anti-reductionists tend to look at the higher levels for explaining
and predicting scientific phenomena. Due to space considerations, this
is a very loose characterization of all these views; for more detailed
explanations see
 (<a href="../reduction-biology/">reductionism in biology</a>,
 <a href="../scientific-reduction/">scientific reduction</a>,
 <a href="../levels-org-biology/">levels of organization in biology</a>,
 <a href="../selection-units/">units and levels of selection</a>,
 <a href="../science-mechanisms/">mechanisms in science</a>,
 <a href="../properties-emergent/">emergent properties</a>,
 <a href="../supervenience/">supervenience</a>).</p>
 
<p>
The traditional layer-cake approach together with its disagreements
about the relative importance of each level is plainly apparent in
ecology (though ecologists tend to use the term <em>scale</em> rather
than level), starting from the fact that different ecological units
(individuals, populations, communities and ecosystems) are distinct
sub-disciplines with their own methodologies (see
 <a href="#UnitEcolRese">&sect;2.1</a>
 &amp;
 <a href="#Meth">&sect;3.5</a>).
 Indeed, the influential conservation biologist Reed Noss claimed
that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
many of the most persistent controversies in ecology can be traced to
different parties viewing a situation at different spatial or temporal
scales &hellip; The scale at which Nature is viewed determines the
patterns and processes detected. (Noss 1992: 240).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Ontological considerations of scale have a long history in ecology.
For example, Odum&rsquo;s seminal textbook for ecology (Odum 1953),
adds populations and communities to the hierarchy of organizational
levels in biology (cell, tissue, organ, organism). Two decades later,
O&rsquo;Neill et al., extended the ontological hierarchy to ecosystems
(O&rsquo;Neill et al. 1986). As shown in
 <a href="#UnitEcolRese">section 2.1</a>,
 there are also ongoing debates in philosophy of ecology about the
ontological status of various ecological units, e.g., populations,
communities and ecosystems, including whether each of these units is a
mere aggregate, a whole or an individual, and whether or not they
reflect a real natural category (Lean 2018; Millstein 2009; Odenbaugh
2007, 2010; Stegenga 2010). Ecological discussions of scale have also
focused on the importance of time as a scale, i.e., how long it takes
for a phenomenon or process to take place. Ecologists developed a
hierarchy where time-scales constrain other organizational scales,
e.g., photosynthesis versus tree growth (O&rsquo;Neill et al. 1986).
According to James DiFrisco (2017), this prioritization of time scale
over other organizational scales is an important conceptual
innovation, which allows the whole organizational concept of scale to
overcome many of the criticisms leveled against it (e.g., by Angela
Potochnik, 2021).</p>

<p>
Ecologists are also concerned with the epistemic effects of scale in
ecology. Ecological phenomena and processes happen at multiple scales
(e.g., populations, ecosystems, seasons, generations) and the scale at
which a phenomenon manifests is often not easy to investigate, so
measurements must occur at other (usually smaller) scales and results
extrapolated to the level of interest (Schneider 2001). A typical
example of &ldquo;the problem of scale&rdquo;, as it has been named,
is biodiversity loss (see
 <a href="#Cons">&sect;2.4</a>),
 where measuring biodiversity necessarily happens at small areas, yet
the effect of species extinction manifests at the level of ecosystems.
As species numbers do not scale directly with increases in
geographical area, there is always a discrepancy between the sample
measures of biodiversity and their extrapolation to the whole
ecosystem (Chase &amp; Knight 2013; Schneider 2001).</p>

<h3 id="Meth">3.5 Methods</h3>

<p>
The main research methods used in ecology are mathematical and
computational models, experiments, observational studies along with a
variety of statistical tools for data collection, analysis,
interpretation and synthesis. Historically, research at various levels
and types of ecosystem were predominantly associated with certain
methods, e.g., aquatic ecosystems focusing on population or
community-level models, island biogeography focusing on field
experiments etc. (Resetarits &amp; Bernardo 1998; Hairston 1989;
Kingsland 1985 [1995], 2005). However, with greater recognition of the
advantages and disadvantages of each method along with technological
advances in data collection and computation power, methods are
becoming increasingly integrated across ecological scales and
sub-disciplines (Kareiva, Parker, &amp; Pascuel 1996; Kareiva &amp;
Andersen 1988; Peck 2004).</p>

<h4 id="Mode">3.5.1 Models</h4>

<p>
Mathematical modeling is an integral part of ecological research
(Odenbaugh 2019b). In fact, for many ecologists, Ecology only became a
truly scientific discipline with the development and extensive use of
mathematical models (Kingsland 1985 [1995], 2005). The history of
ecology is punctuated with influential models, such as models of
population growth (Reed &amp; Pearl 1927), the Lotka-Volterra
predation and competition models (Knuuttila &amp; Loettgers 2017;
Weisberg 2007b), Species distribution models (such as GARP and MAXENT;
Sobek-Swant et al. 2012; Townsend Peterson et al. 2007) and Ecosystem
Network Models (such as ECOPATH and ECOSIM; Heymans et al. 2016).</p>

<h5>Model Complexity</h5>

<p>
An important and ongoing debate in the literature on ecological
modeling concerns the appropriate level of complexity that should be
incorporated into mathematical models. In the first camp are those who
argue that models should be simple so as to <em>reduce</em> the
inherent complexity of systems, making them more tractable and
generalizable (Hitchcock &amp; Sober 2004; Perretti, Munch &amp;
Sugihara 2013). The rationale is that reducing complexity allows
scientists to distinguish between the core causal factors that give
rise to classes of phenomena and mere details that are idiosyncratic
to particular systems. In the second camp are those who believe that
models should <em>incorporate</em> complexity, so as to provide more
accurate pictures of complex systems (Essington et al. 2017; Evans et
al. 2013; Travis et al. 2014). The rationale here is that mirroring
the complexity of real-world systems ensures that the models will
capture all the relevant causal factors and dynamics giving rise to
complex phenomena.</p>

<p>
A more nuanced conceptual framework for modeling in Ecology comes from
the work of Richard Levins (Elliott-Graves 2020a; Levins 1966, 1993;
Weisberg 2007a). Levins argues that biological systems are incredibly
complex, so much so that it is impractical to capture all the
complexity in a single model. Even if it were feasible to construct
such a model, its results would make little sense to us. Moreover,
models are used for different purposes, such as understanding
phenomena, making predictions and intervening on the world. Thus,
rather than attempting to determine <em>the</em> optimal level of
model complexity, Levins argues that what counts as optimal in each
case will depend on the system being studied and the model&rsquo;s
intended use. More specifically, Levins identifies three desiderata
for model-building: realism, generality and precision. Realism refers
to how accurately a model captures the causal structure of the world;
models are realistic when they are not overly simplified or idealized.
Models are general when they apply to many systems in the world and
precise when their outputs are finely specified (Levins 1966, 1993).
Due to the complexity of biological systems, scientists can maximize
only two out of the three desiderata. This gives rise to three
strategies for model building along with three corresponding types of
models. Type I models (such as the Lotka-Volterra population dynamics
models) sacrifice realism for precision and generality, Type II
models, (such as species distribution models and ecosystem network
models) sacrifice generality for realism and precision and Type III
models (such as loop analysis and fuzzy interaction webs) sacrifice
precision for generality and realism.</p>

<h5>Model Pluralism</h5>

<p>
According to Levins, scientists need not choose between models, but
can (and should) be pluralists and use multiple strategies. There are
two ways in which model pluralism can be conceptualized. The first
concerns the discipline of ecology as a whole: different research
questions or different phenomena call for different models. Thus,
there will be cases where generality is more important, others in
which predictive accuracy is more important and so on. In each of
these cases a different type of model might be most useful. The second
conceptualization of model pluralism (which Levins also supported) is
stronger and concerns each particular scientific investigation. Here,
the idea is that scientists should use multiple models (ideally from
different strategies) to investigate a particular phenomenon. As long
as the models are independent from each other, then they can cancel
out, or at least mitigate, each other&rsquo;s errors and biases. If we
are very lucky, the model outputs will converge, yielding
<em>inferential robustness</em>, which can increase our confidence in
the models (Justus 2012). In Levins&rsquo;s own words, &ldquo;truth is
at the intersection of independent lies&rdquo; (1966: 423).</p>

<p>
For an argument against Levins&rsquo;s proposed trade-off framework
see (Orzack 2005; Orzack &amp; Sober 1993). For Levins&rsquo;s
response to these criticisms, see (Levins 1993). For discussion and
refinement of Levins&rsquo;s framework see (Elliott-Graves 2020a,
2023; Justus 2005, 2012; Odenbaugh 2003; Weisberg 2007a).</p>

<h4 id="Expe">3.5.2 Experiments</h4>

<p>
As is the case with other disciplines, philosophers of ecology tend to
focus more on the theoretical aspects of scientific practice
 (<a href="../biology-experiment/">experiment in biology</a>,
 see also
 <a href="#ScieStatEcol">&sect;3.1</a>),
 which includes theory building and testing, model construction and
how models provide information about the real world (Elliott-Graves
2020b; Odenbaugh 2001; Weisberg 2007b). Nonetheless, experiments have
an important place in ecological research, because of the sheer
quantity of experimental research and because of the epistemic
implications of experimentation. Just as with experiments in other
disciplines, there are worries about the epistemic conclusions that
can be drawn
 (<a href="../biology-experiment/">experiment in biology</a>).
 The aim of experiments is to make causal inferences, by identifying
connections between causes and effects (Millstein 2019). The problem
is that it is not always easy to establish these causal connections:
experiments can simply fail to establish any causal connection, the
causal connection may be limited to the experimental setup, or even an
artifact of the experimental setup
 (<a href="../biology-experiment/">experiment in biology</a>).
 In ecology, experiments are very heterogeneous, in terms of the type
of experimental setup and the level at which they are conducted. In
this context, heterogeneity is useful, at it can help us understand
and categorize the epistemic issues arising from experimentation in
ecology.</p>

<p>
Ecological experiments can be divided into three categories,
<em>laboratory</em>, <em>field</em> and <em>natural</em> experiments,
each of which has epistemic advantages and disadvantages (Diamond
1986; Millstein 2019). Laboratory experiments are those where the
perturbations are produced by the experimenter in the laboratory
(Diamond 1986). The main advantage of laboratory experiments is that
the experimenter has greater control over the biotic and abiotic
environment, which is thought to provide greater confidence in the
causal inferences that can be made from the experiment (Millstein
2019). However, this control comes at a cost: the laboratory setting
is an artificial environment, that isolates phenomenon being
investigated from the complex causal network it normally operates in.
This means that the causal inferences established in the laboratory
setting might not extend outside the laboratory (this is sometimes
referred to as low external validity (Guala 2003). Natural experiments
are much more realistic than laboratory experiments, because they do
not take place in the artificial setting of the laboratory and can
include many more species and perturbations (Millstein 2019). However,
as the experimenter has no control over these variables their results
yield much weaker causal inferences (this is sometimes referred to as
low internal validity (Guala 2003). Field experiments fall in between
laboratory and natural experiments in both dimensions, in the sense
that they afford the experimenter some level of control but are also
much less artificial than laboratory experiments as they provide
scientists with more complete picture of the phenomenon under
investigation (Diamond 1986; Thrush et al. 2000).</p>

<p>
Ecological field studies, (i.e., field experiments and observational
studies), deserve some additional attention, as they had an important
role in the development of ecology as a scientific discipline (Sagarin
&amp; Pauchard 2010). The recognition that something is lost when
populations are isolated in the laboratory, and that it is important
to be able to observe community dynamics in all their complexity
formed the basis of an alternative approach the study of ecological
systems. This approach has been criticized regularly by both modelers
and laboratory ecologists as un-scientific (see
 <a href="#ScieStatEcol">&sect;3.1</a>
 and
 <a href="#Mode">&sect;3.5.1</a>),
 yet it has persisted, in many parts and sub-disciplines of ecology,
such as Elton&rsquo;s niche theory and approach to the study of
biological invaders
 (<a href="#Nich">&sect;2.2</a>
 and
 <a href="#BiolInva">&sect;2.3</a>)
 ecosystem ecology and modeling
 (<a href="#UnitEcolRese">&sect;2.1</a>
 and
 <a href="#Mode">&sect;3.5.1</a>)
 and island biogeography. An important early landmark in the
establishment of this general approach was the theory of
<em>succession</em> (i.e., how a community develops after a
disturbance such as a forest fire), whose ascent in the late
nineteenth century was supported by a study of the regular patterns of
vegetation variation on the sand dunes surrounding Lake Michigan, led
by Henry Cowles. This, along with other field studies, showed that
ecological systems outside the laboratory could have repeatable and
predictable patterns which could form the basis of a theory (see
discussion in Inkpen 2017).</p>

<h3 id="Func">3.6 Functions</h3>

<p>
Talk of &ldquo;functions&rdquo; is pervasive in ecology, in numerous
contexts and at various scales, such as ecosystem functioning,
functional diversity, functional types and so on (Jax 2005, 2010;
Morrow 2023; Odenbaugh 2010, 2019a). Most ecological views on the
nature and role of functions are closer to views in general philosophy
of science than those in philosophy of biology. The main reason for
this is that philosophers of ecology reject the traditional
<em>selected-effect</em> view of functions, in the context of ecology
(Dussault 2018; Maclaurin &amp; Sterelny 2008; Morrow 2023; Nunes-Neto
et al. 2014). The selected-effect view states that the function a
trait is the activity that it was selected for performing. For
example, the human heart has the function of circulating blood if, and
only if, it evolved to do so by natural selection in the recent past
(Godfrey-Smith 1994; Odenbaugh 2019a).</p>

<p>
The problem with this account, for the ecological context, is that
evidence about evolutionary history is not needed when making
functional explanations in ecology (Dussault 2018; Morrow 2023;
Odenbaugh 2019a). Some philosophers argue that they are better
described as the roles of parts of an ecosystem that help explain the
behavior of the ecosystem. The <em>systemic capacity</em> or
<em>causal role</em> accounts of ecological function are based on
Cummins&rsquo;s (1975) view, which roughly states that a component of
a system has a function when the capacity of a component helps to
explain a capacity of the system (Lean 2021; Maclaurin &amp; Sterelny
2008; Odenbaugh 2019a). For example, the capacity of detritivores to
break down litter, help to explain the capacity of ecosystems to
recycle nitrogen. One issue regarding role functions is whether they
permit malfunctions, for example whether invasive species are
dysfunctional. On a causal role theory, invasive species do not count
as dysfunctional, which goes against some people&rsquo;s intuitions
(Lean 2021, see also discussion in Morrow 2023). Other open questions
regarding causal role accounts are whether it is legitimate to assign
functional roles to abiotic parts of the environment (Odenbaugh 2010)
and whether they accurately identify the explanatory targets of
ecologists (i.e., what ecologists are actually interested in
explaining) (Dussault 2018).</p>

<p>
Two other views are the <em>persistence</em> accounts, where functions
contribute to the persistence of the system they are a part of
(Dussault 2018), and the <em>organizational</em> accounts, where
functions can roughly be understood as components that help to
maintain the organization of the system they are a part of (Moreno
&amp; Mossio 2015; Nunes-Neto et al. 2014). Finally, Millstein (2020)
argues that role functions are <em>coevolved,</em> so they can be
understood as a type of selected effect function. For example, the
function of pollinators is to help flowering plants to reproduce,
because flowering plants and pollinators have coevolved together.</p>

<p>
A parallel issue is whether role functions can be integrated or
unified with other accounts of function in biology, or whether it is
best to adopt a pluralistic account of functions for different
contexts (Lean 2021; Morrow 2023). It is also possible to be a
pluralist in a different sense, namely allowing that different
functions exist at different levels of ecological hierarchy (see
 <a href="#Leve">&sect;3.4</a>).
 For example, Odenbaugh (2019a) argues that Millstein&rsquo;s version
of selected effects functions can occur at the community level, yet
only systemic capacity functions occur at the level of ecosystems.</p>

<h3 id="EcolApplScie">3.7 Ecology as an Applied Science</h3>

<p>
There is a long-standing distinction in philosophy of science between
science that is &ldquo;pure&rdquo; &ldquo;basic&rdquo; or
&ldquo;fundamental&rdquo; and science that is &ldquo;applied&rdquo;
(Douglas 2014; Roll-Hansen 2017). Historically, the distinction was
meant to separate research that focused on building theoretical
knowledge from research that merely applied the existing knowledge to
solve particular problems in the real world (Carrier &amp; Nordmann
2011; Douglas 2014). However, this distinction has been criticized, as
many scientific disciplines, ecology included, routinely blend aspects
of both pure and applied research (Douglas 2009; Kitcher 2001). Still,
some philosophers have pointed out the distinction can be meaningful,
as some research focuses on discovering and explaining phenomena while
others focus more on identifying and solving problems in the world
(Elliott-Graves, 2023; Justus 2021). Moreover, while <em>epistemic
values</em> (those that directly help with the attainment of
knowledge, such as truth, empirical adequacy, explanatory power,
simplicity, generality, theoretical unity etc.) are important for both
pure and applied research, in applied research, contextual values
(sometimes called <em>non-epistemic</em> values) (those that arise
from the social and/or ethical context within which a scientific
investigation takes place) are particularly important (Douglas 2000;
Justus 2021; Longino 1990; McMullin 1982; Rolin 2016; see also
 <a href="../feminism-epistemology/">feminist epistemology and philosophy of science</a>
 and
 <a href="../scientific-objectivity/">scientific objectivity</a>).</p>
 
<h4 id="Valu">3.7.1 Values</h4>

<p>
It is uncontroversial to say that a significant proportion of
ecological research is <em>value-laden</em>. For example, conservation
biology
 (<a href="#Cons">&sect;2.4</a>)
 is inherently and inescapably &ldquo;ethically driven&rdquo;, as
ethical values affect how concepts such as biodiversity and nature are
defined and measured, and how choices for various strategies for
conservation are made and evaluated (Justus 2021,
 <a href="../conservation-biology/">conservation biology</a>).
 Nonetheless, there is some disagreement between philosophers about
the role that non-epistemic values should play in applied sciences. On
one view, termed &ldquo;fact-value entanglement&rdquo;, facts and
non-epistemic values are inextricably linked and inseparable (Douglas
2009; Kincaid et al. 2007). Examples are often framed in terms of
<em>inductive risk</em>, which can roughly be defined as the risk of
accepting a hypothesis that is false or rejecting a hypothesis that is
true (Magnus 2022). The idea is that there is always a level of
uncertainty when it comes to accepting or rejecting a hypothesis, and
that non-epistemic values play an important (though often overlooked)
role in whether a hypothesis is accepted or rejected. Thus, for
example, if we are trying to determine whether or not to allow logging
in an area home to an endangered species (an example from the
literature is that of the Northern Spotted Owl, see
 <a href="../conservation-biology/">conservation biology</a>,
 Justus 2021), the decision will be influenced by ethical
considerations for the species in question, but also by considerations
for the livelihood of the loggers, the local economy and so on.</p>

<p>
One argument against this view, particularly relevant to ecology, is
that focusing on non-epistemic values is problematic for the purposes
of policy making, because if policies for conservation include
non-epistemic values and these values are not widely shared, then the
policy in question is unlikely to be successfully implemented (Burke
&amp; Lauenroth 2009; see discussion in
 <a href="../conservation-biology/">conservation biology</a>).
 Instead, the argument goes, facts are not only distinguishable from
other values, but it is more likely to convince people (policy makers
and the general public) that a policy will be successful if it focuses
exclusively on the facts and does not bring in contextual values.
Similarly, Justus (2021) argues that while non-epistemic values are
important in applied ecology, it is possible to distinguish between
fact and non-epistemic values. He argues that there has been
conceptual and methodological progress in conservation biology, with
the adoption of new and better methods for conservation planning. The
adoption of these new methods, however, is due to considerations of
facts and epistemic values, rather than non-epistemic values.</p>

<h4 id="Inte">3.7.2 Interdisciplinarity</h4>

<p>
Interdisciplinarity and its relations are yet more concepts that are
difficult to define (Gr&uuml;ne-Yanoff 2016; Klein 2010; M&auml;ki
2016). For the purposes of this entry, we can understand
interdisciplinarity as the collaborative integration of different
disciplines for a common goal (Klein 2010).</p>

<h5>Ecology &amp; Evolution</h5>

<p>
There have been many instances throughout this entry, where the
ecological definition or approach to a topic differed significantly to
its evolutionary counterpart (e.g.,
 <a href="#Popu">&sect;2.1.3</a>,
 <a href="#Func">&sect;3.6</a>). Nonetheless, there are some research programs that
bridge the gap between ecology and evolution. One such program that
has received a lot of philosophical attention is <em>niche</em>
<em>construction</em>. Put simply, niche construction occurs when
organisms alter their environment, thus constructing their niche
(Odling-Smee et al. 2013). For example, animals build nests, burrows
and other artifacts, plants change the amount of nutrients or other
chemicals in the soil and air and so on (Laland et al. 2016). By
altering their environment in these ways, organisms change or create
new selection pressures, thus influencing their own evolution (Levins
&amp; Lewontin 1985). There are roughly two parts to the process of
niche construction. The first is the construction of the niche, for
example through <em>ecosystem engineering</em>, where organisms
actively alter their environment (Odling-Smee et al. 2013). Some
biologists adopt a broader notion of &ldquo;construction&rdquo; to
include behavioral changes, such as choosing a certain habitat,
migration between habitats and various forms of adjustment or
specialization (Odling-Smee et al. 2013; Trappes et al. 2022). The
second part of niche construction is the effect of these changes on
the evolution of the organisms. Changing the environment can change
the selective pressures on the organisms within that environment,
e.g., by adding or removing limiting factors such as temperature or
shade. However, these effects are also explained by other
adaptationist accounts of evolution, such as Richard Dawkins&rsquo;s
&ldquo;extended phenotype&rdquo; concept (Dawkins 1982 [1999]). Niche
construction proper includes &ldquo;ecological inheritance&rdquo;,
where populations pass on the modified environment to their offspring
(see also
 <a href="../inheritance-systems/">inheritance systems</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Despite the potential of interdisciplinarity between ecology and
evolution, Stephan Linquist (2019) argues that the two disciplines
actually occupy &ldquo;distinct epistemic niches&rdquo;. He points out
that some ecological explanations do not benefit from evolutionary
details and vice versa. Therefore, scientists should investigate
whether a combined eco-evo approach is likely to be fruitful for their
research project, rather than assuming it is the best option.</p>

<h5>Ecology and Economics</h5>

<p>
A notable example of methodological integration is the adoption of
economic models into ecology and the subsequent cross-pollination of
ideas between the two disciplines (Justus 2014; MacLeod &amp; Nagatsu
2016; O&rsquo;Malley &amp; Soyer 2012). An important landmark was the
adoption of Agent Based models from decision and game theory into
ecology and their development into Individual-Based models. The
adoption of these models spearheaded a recognition that many classical
models in ecology were overly simplistic and unrealistic and
highlighted the importance of adding more detail to ecological models
(Railsback &amp; Grimm 2011). At the same time, it has contributed to
the adoption of &ldquo;methodological individualism&rdquo; as a
genuine approach in ecology, which advances an individualistic
understanding of the world, with moderate but not extreme levels of
reductionism (Justus 2014; see also
 <a href="#IndiOrga">&sect;2.1.4.</a>
 &amp;
 <a href="#Leve">&sect;3.4</a>).</p>
 
<p>
However, it should also be noted that some interdisciplinary endeavors
between ecology and economics are widely criticized. For example, the
field of ecological economics sought to monetize <em>ecosystem
services</em>, so as to incorporate biodiversity and conservation
goals into cost-benefit analyses, but has been criticized by
economists and conservation biologists for failing to live up to
expectations of either field (Norton &amp; Noonan 2007).</p>

<h1>Yog&#257;c&#257;ra</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Sun Jul 7, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Alongside Madhyamaka, Yog&#257;c&#257;ra is one of the two major
philosophical traditions of Mah&#257;y&#257;na Buddhism that
originated in India. The philosophical and soteriological ideas set
forth in the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra works had a great impact on the
development of Buddhist thought not only in the Indian subcontinent
but also in other parts of Asia, especially in China, Japan and Tibet.
Besides its highly influential exposition of the stages of the
Mah&#257;y&#257;na path to liberation, the tradition developed several
emblematic philosophical doctrines, such as the mind-only
(<em>cittam&#257;tra</em>) teaching, the theory of three natures
(<em>trisvabh&#257;va</em>), and the eightfold classification of
consciousness, including the introduction of the so-called defiled
mind (<em>kli&#7779;&#7789;amanas</em>) and the substratum or store
consciousness (<em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>). Through the
systematic elucidation and justification of these doctrines, the
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra school made a significant contribution to the
metaphysical, epistemological, and phenomenological study of
consciousness.</p>

<p>
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra is a spatio-temporarily extensive and
philosophically diverse tradition. According to the later Tibetan
doxographical literature, Yog&#257;c&#257;ra developed into two main
branches in India. One is directly connected with the works of the
school&rsquo;s founders or first systemisers, the (half-)brothers
Asa&#7749;ga and Vasubandhu (c. 4<sup>th</sup>&ndash;5<sup>th</sup>
century CE), and their followers, most notably Sthiramati and
Dharmap&#257;la (both dated to the c. 6<sup>th</sup> century CE). The
other branch is the logico-epistemological or
<em>pram&#257;&#7751;av&#257;da</em> (&ldquo;doctrine of valid
knowledge&rdquo;) tradition associated with the works of Dign&#257;ga
(c. late 5<sup>th</sup> to early 6<sup>th</sup> century CE) and
Dharmak&#299;rti (c. mid-6<sup>th</sup> to mid-7<sup>th</sup> century
CE) and their
 successors.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 While this distinction was not self-consciously adopted by these
figures themselves, it reflects some important differences between
their doctrinal and methodological commitments. Asa&#7749;ga and
Vasubandhu&rsquo;s tradition aimed at laying down and fortifying the
theoretical foundations of Yog&#257;c&#257;ra by providing a sustained
explanation and defence of the school&rsquo;s key ideas introduced in
the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra <em>s&#363;tra</em> literature. By contrast,
Dign&#257;ga and Dharmak&#299;rti focused more on topics in logic and
epistemology that allowed them to engage in meaningful (and formally
valid) debates with their non-Buddhist contemporaries. Accordingly,
they were less concerned with spelling out the meaning of
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra <em>s&#363;tra</em>s or discussing their
characteristic concepts such as the
<em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>. This entry will focus
primarily on the Indian Yog&#257;c&#257;ra tradition as explicated in
the works of Asa&#7749;ga and Vasubandhu and their commentators. It
will, nonetheless, incorporate those arguments of the
logico-epistemological tradition that complement Asa&#7749;ga and
Vasubandhu&rsquo;s attempts to develop the unique doctrinal and
conceptual framework of Yog&#257;c&#257;ra.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="HistTextBackYogc">1. The historical and textual background of Yog&#257;c&#257;ra</h2>

<h3 id="NameTrad">1.1 The names of the tradition</h3>

<p>
The tradition is most commonly referred to as Yog&#257;c&#257;ra, with
its followers called
 Yog&#257;c&#257;ras.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 Various explanations were proposed as to why the school has been
given this particular name. One possibility is that it refers to the
foundational treatise (<em>&#347;&#257;stra</em>) of the tradition,
the <em>Yog&#257;c&#257;rabh&#363;mi</em> (&ldquo;The Stages of
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra&rdquo;). This naming practice would be analogous to
that of, for instance, the Abhidharmic Vaibh&#257;&#7779;ika school,
which takes its name from the tradition&rsquo;s seminal work, the
<em>Abhidharmamah&#257;vibh&#257;&#7779;&#257;</em> (&ldquo;The Great
Exegesis of Abhidharma&rdquo;). Accordingly, the Yog&#257;c&#257;ras
are those who study and follow the
 <em>Yog&#257;c&#257;rabh&#363;mi</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
While this might explain the direct origin of the school&rsquo;s name,
it does not shed light on the meaning of the term
<em>yog&#257;c&#257;ra</em> itself. The compound
<em>yog&#257;c&#257;ra</em> consists of the words <em>yoga</em> and
<em>&#257;c&#257;ra</em>. The latter means practice. The meaning of
<em>yoga</em>, however, is less straightforward. It can be understood
more broadly as discipline, but in this context it presumably refers
to meditation or some sort of mental cultivation. Indeed, scholars
often assume that the term <em>yog&#257;c&#257;ra</em> was originally
applied to a community of accomplished meditation practitioners in the
&#346;r&#257;vakay&#257;na (i.e., mainstream Buddhist) tradition
(Deleanu 2006: 158). Accordingly, the name Yog&#257;c&#257;ra was
arguably meant to indicate that the tradition placed particular
emphasis on transforming the mind and gaining insight into the nature
of reality through sustained meditative practice.</p>

<p>
The Yog&#257;c&#257;ra school is also known by various other names,
including <em>vij&ntilde;&#257;nav&#257;da</em> (&ldquo;doctrine of
consciousness&rdquo;), <em>cittam&#257;tra</em> (&ldquo;mind
only&rdquo;), and <em>vij&ntilde;aptim&#257;tra</em> (&ldquo;cognition
only&rdquo;). The term <em>vij&ntilde;&#257;nav&#257;da</em>
(&ldquo;doctrine of consciousness&rdquo;) highlights that the
Yog&#257;c&#257;ras were keenly interested in studying the nature of
consciousness and its transformation on the path to liberation. The
names <em>cittam&#257;tra</em> (&ldquo;mind only&rdquo;) and
<em>vij&ntilde;aptim&#257;tra</em> (&ldquo;cognition only&rdquo;) more
overtly express the school&rsquo;s signature doctrine that there is
&ldquo;only&rdquo; or &ldquo;nothing but&rdquo; (<em>m&#257;tra</em>)
&ldquo;mind&rdquo; (<em>citta</em>) or &ldquo;cognition&rdquo;
(<em>vij&ntilde;apti</em>). Accordingly, the tradition attributes some
kind of (epistemological or ontological) priority to the mind,
implying, most importantly, that the sensible world depends for its
nature and existence on being cognised by a mind. In Western
philosophy, this position is commonly labelled as
&ldquo;idealism&rdquo;, an umbrella term that encompasses a wide
variety of senses in which the mind, with its various mental
operations, can have priority over the objects it cognises.</p>

<h3 id="MainTextSourFiguYogcPhil">1.2 The main textual sources and figures of Yog&#257;c&#257;ra philosophy</h3>

<p>
One of the earliest and, arguably, most influential collections of
Mah&#257;y&#257;na scriptures, the
<em>Praj&ntilde;&#257;p&#257;ramit&#257;</em> (&ldquo;Perfection of
Wisdom&rdquo;) literature&mdash;and its characteristic conception of
the emptiness (<em>&#347;&#363;nyat&#257;</em>) or insubstantiality
(<em>nair&#257;tmya</em>) of all phenomena
(<em>dharma</em>)&mdash;gained great importance in both the Madhyamaka
and Yog&#257;c&#257;ra traditions. Certain <em>s&#363;tra</em>s,
however, rose to prominence in the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra school
specifically, such as the <em>Sa&#7747;dhinirmocana S&#363;tra</em>
(&ldquo;Discourse Unravelling the Intent [of the Buddha]&rdquo;) or
the <em>La&#7749;k&#257;vat&#257;ra S&#363;tra</em> (&ldquo;Discourse
on the Descent into La&#7749;ka&rdquo;). These <em>s&#363;tra</em>s,
together with the <em>Yog&#257;c&#257;rabh&#363;mi</em> treatise
mentioned earlier, are the foundational sources for studying the
origins and early development of key Yog&#257;c&#257;ra doctrines.</p>

<p>
Dating these texts is notoriously difficult. The
<em>Sa&#7747;dhinirmocana S&#363;tra</em> is the earliest
characteristically Yog&#257;c&#257;ra <em>s&#363;tra</em>, which in
its present form could not have existed earlier than the end of the
third century CE (Powers 1993: 5). With its elucidation of key
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra doctrines (especially in chapters 5 to 7), the text
served as one of the main sources for the philosophical elaborations
of Asa&#7749;ga and Vasubandhu. The <em>Sa&#7747;dhinirmocana
S&#363;tra</em> is particularly known for its self-description as the
&ldquo;third turning of the wheel of the doctrine&rdquo;, by which it
means that the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra tenets represent the culmination and
definitive interpretation of the Buddha&rsquo;s teachings, in contrast
to the earlier &ldquo;inadequate&rdquo; expositions offered by the
Abhidharma and Madhyamaka schools. While, within a tradition, the
composition of <em>&#347;&#257;stra</em>s tends to follow that of the
<em>s&#363;tra</em>s, scholars assume that parts of the
<em>Sa&#7747;dhinirmocana S&#363;tra</em> postdate certain sections of
the voluminous
<em>Yog&#257;c&#257;rabh&#363;mi</em>(<em>&#347;&#257;stra</em>)
(Schmithausen 1987: 12&ndash;13; Williams 2009: 85).</p>

<p>
The <em>Yog&#257;c&#257;rabh&#363;mi</em> is traditionally ascribed to
Asa&#7749;ga (or, according to the Chinese tradition, to
Asa&#7749;ga&rsquo;s teacher, Maitreya), but most scholars today agree
that it is a compilation consisting of several heterogeneous layers
and was composed over an extended period of time (Schmithausen 1987:
13; Kramer 2005: 3&ndash;4; Deleanu 2006: 154&ndash;156; Delhey 2013:
502). The two most renowned sections of the
<em>Yog&#257;c&#257;rabh&#363;mi</em> are the
<em>&#346;r&#257;vakabh&#363;mi</em> and the
<em>Bodhisattvabh&#363;mi</em>. The former deals with practices
associated with the <em>&#347;r&#257;vaka</em> practitioners of
mainstream Buddhism, while the latter elucidates the
<em>bodhisattva</em> path to Buddhahood and some of the central
doctrines of Yog&#257;c&#257;ra. It is important to note, however,
that the <em>Yog&#257;c&#257;rabh&#363;mi</em> corpus lacks certain
characteristic teachings of the more mature Yog&#257;c&#257;ra
tradition, most importantly the <em>cittam&#257;tra</em> or
<em>vij&ntilde;aptim&#257;tra</em> doctrine and its idealist
connotations (Schmithausen 2005, 244).</p>

<p>
The dating of the <em>La&#7749;k&#257;vat&#257;ra S&#363;tra</em> is
also rather uncertain. According to Schmithausen (1987: 263&ndash;264,
n. 102, and 1992), the text is unlikely to be one of the earliest
sources of Yog&#257;c&#257;ra, as it seems to rely on already
developed concepts and presupposes the existence of Vasubandhu&rsquo;s
<em>Tri&#7747;&#347;ik&#257;</em> and
<em>Vi&#7747;&#347;ik&#257;</em>. Moreover, the <em>s&#363;tra</em> is
not quoted by either Asa&#7749;ga or Vasubandhu, thus it presumably
postdates their philosophical developments. Lindtner (1992), however,
argues that an early recension of the <em>La&#7749;k&#257;vat&#257;ra
S&#363;tra</em> was known to and influenced the works of the
Madhyamaka thinkers N&#257;g&#257;rjuna (c. 150&ndash;250 CE) and his
disciple &#256;ryadeva. In any case, the <em>s&#363;tra</em> became a
formative text of the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra tradition with its exposition
of the <em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em> and the mind-only
teaching. It is also noteworthy that it discusses the concept of
buddha-nature or buddha-essence
(<em>tath&#257;gatagarbha</em>)&mdash;the highly influential doctrine
that all sentient beings contain the essence of a buddha or have the
inherent potential to become one&mdash;and identifies it with the
<em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>.</p>

<p>
Building on and systemising these early materials, it is Asa&#7749;ga
and Vasubandhu who should be credited with the development of
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra as a distinctive philosophical school. The
tradition ascribes a significant number of works to each of them, but
their authenticity is still subject to scholarly debate. The two most
important works attributed by scholars to Asa&#7749;ga are the
<em>Abhidharmasamuccaya</em> (&ldquo;Compendium of Abhidharma&rdquo;)
and the <em>Mah&#257;y&#257;nasa&#7747;graha</em> (&ldquo;Summary of
the Great Vehicle&rdquo;). The former provides a comprehensive
explanation of various categories of <em>dharma</em>s (i.e., mental
and physical phenomena considered to be the ultimate building blocks
of reality in the Abhidharma system) from a Yog&#257;c&#257;ra and
Mah&#257;y&#257;na viewpoint; the latter is an influential treatise on
general aspects of Yog&#257;c&#257;ra theory and practice.</p>

<p>
As we have seen in the case of the
<em>Yog&#257;c&#257;rabh&#363;mi</em>, there are some
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra works that are traditionally attributed either to
Asa&#7749;ga or to Maitreya, Asa&#7749;ga&rsquo;s teacher. The
identity of Maitreya is ambiguous. While traditional sources identify
him with the future Buddha whose treatises were transmitted by
Asa&#7749;ga, modern scholarship considers Maitreya&mdash;or,
according to the colophon of certain works,
Maitreyan&#257;tha&mdash;to be a historical figure (Frauwallner 1956:
297). According to tradition, Maitreya composed an important set of
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra texts known as the &ldquo;Five Treatises of
Maitreya&rdquo;. These are</p>

<ul>

<li>the <em>Abhisamay&#257;la&#7747;k&#257;ra</em> (&ldquo;The
Ornament of Clear Realisation&rdquo;),</li>

<li>the <em>Madhy&#257;ntavibh&#257;ga</em> (&ldquo;The Discrimination
of the Middle from the Extremes&rdquo;),</li>

<li>the <em>Dharmadharmat&#257;vibh&#257;ga</em> (&ldquo;The
Discrimination of <em>Dharma</em>s from their True
Nature&rdquo;),</li>

<li>the <em>Mah&#257;y&#257;nas&#363;tr&#257;la&#7747;k&#257;ra</em>
(&ldquo;The Ornament of the Mah&#257;y&#257;na
<em>S&#363;tra</em>s&rdquo;) and</li>

<li>the <em>Ratnagotravibh&#257;ga</em> (&ldquo;Analysis of the
Lineage of the [Three] Jewels&rdquo;) also known as
<em>Uttaratantra</em> (&ldquo;Sublime Continuation&rdquo;).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Most of these texts provide a comprehensive outline of the
Mah&#257;y&#257;na path to enlightenment while introducing
practitioners to the foundational doctrines of Yog&#257;c&#257;ra.
There are also a few distinctive themes appearing in some of these
works that are worth mentioning. The
<em>Madhy&#257;ntavibh&#257;ga</em>, for instance, as the title
suggests, depicts Yog&#257;c&#257;ra as a middle way between the
extreme of permanence, referring to the mind-independent existence of
objects endorsed by the &#256;bhidharmikas, and the extreme of
annihilation, understood as the Madhyamaka view of universal
emptiness. The <em>Abhisamay&#257;la&#7747;k&#257;ra</em> is a
versified synopsis of the teachings of the
<em>Praj&ntilde;&#257;p&#257;ramit&#257; S&#363;tra</em>s. The
<em>Ratnagotravibh&#257;ga</em>, in turn, is an important overview of
the <em>tath&#257;gatagarbha</em>
 doctrine.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
As for Vasubandhu&rsquo;s corpus, the numerous works traditionally
attributed to him display an even greater doctrinal diversity. His,
arguably, most famous work, the <em>Abhidharmako&#347;a</em>
(&ldquo;Treasury of Abhidharma&rdquo;) with its
<em>bh&#257;&#7779;ya</em> (&ldquo;commentary&rdquo;), for instance,
is not a Yog&#257;c&#257;ra treatise, but an Abhidharma manual
discussing a variety of issues and debates in Abhidharma
 thought.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
 Turning to Vasubandhu&rsquo;s Yog&#257;c&#257;ra works, one of his
most widely studied treatises in Western scholarship is the
<em>Vi&#7747;&#347;ik&#257;</em> (&ldquo;Twenty Verses&rdquo;), which
is an argumentative philosophical text defending the mind-only
doctrine against various realist objections. It is accompanied by a
commentary (<em>v&#7771;tti</em>) also traditionally attributed to
Vasubandhu. Vasubandhu&rsquo;s other important Yog&#257;c&#257;ra
treatise, the <em>Tri&#7747;&#347;ik&#257;</em> (&ldquo;Thirty
Verses&rdquo;), contains fewer arguments. Its primary purpose is to
provide a synopsis of the school&rsquo;s foundational doctrines and
their soteriological significance. Despite its Yog&#257;c&#257;ra
content, the work has a palpable Abhidharmic character in its way of
exposition. A similar observation can be made of Vasubandhu&rsquo;s
<em>Karmasiddhiprakara&#7751;a</em> (&ldquo;A Discussion of the
Demonstration of Action&rdquo;), which focuses on topics such as
action and karmic continuity, as well as of the
<em>Pa&ntilde;caskandhaka</em> (&ldquo;Explanation of the Five
Aggregates&rdquo;), which presents a concise analysis of the five
<em>skandha</em>s, i.e., the aggregates constituting sentient beings.
While these two works contain some of the characteristic doctrines of
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra, such as the notion of the store or substratum
consciousness or the defiled mind, they are reminiscent of the
<em>Abhidharmako&#347;a</em>(<em>bh&#257;&#7779;ya</em>) in terms of
their scholastic character and the philosophical positions discussed.
Another significant text worthy of mention is the
<em>Trisvabh&#257;vanirde&#347;a</em> (&ldquo;Teaching on the Three
Natures&rdquo;). Although the authorship of the work is a matter of
contention (see in particular Kapstein 2018), it is an invaluable
source for studying the development of the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra theory
of three
 natures.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The works of Asa&#7749;ga, Maitreya and Vasubandhu are accompanied and
elaborated upon by a rich commentarial tradition. One of the most
prolific commentators of the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra tradition is
Sthiramati, who not only provided extensive explanations of the
treatises of the school&rsquo;s founders, but also made important
original contributions to the development of Yog&#257;c&#257;ra
thought. The Yog&#257;c&#257;ra commentaries and compilations
attributed to Sthiramati by their colophons are the
<em>Pa&ntilde;caskandhakavibh&#257;&#7779;&#257;</em>, the
<em>Tri&#7747;&#347;ik&#257;vij&ntilde;aptibh&#257;&#7779;ya</em>, the
<em>Abhidharmasamuccayavy&#257;khy&#257;</em>, the
<em>Madhy&#257;ntavibh&#257;ga&#7789;&#299;k&#257;</em> and the

*<em>S&#363;tr&#257;la&#7747;k&#257;rav&#7771;ttibh&#257;&#7779;ya</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 As for the Chinese reception of the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra doctrines, it
is important to mention Dharmap&#257;la, whose lineage was brought to
China by the well-known Chinese monk and pilgrim Xuanzang after his
studies in India. In his <em>Cheng weishi lun</em>&mdash;a summary of
ten commentaries on Vasubandhu&rsquo;s
<em>Tri&#7747;&#347;ik&#257;</em>&mdash;Xuanzang took
Dharmap&#257;la&rsquo;s commentary on the
<em>Tri&#7747;&#347;ik&#257;</em> as the correct interpretation of
Vasubandhu&rsquo;s text. A similarly important figure in the Chinese
context is Param&#257;rtha (c. 6<sup>th</sup> century CE), a
translator (into Chinese) and exegete of several Yog&#257;c&#257;ra
works. Param&#257;rtha&rsquo;s name is closely associated with the
doctrine of taintless consciousness
(*<em>amalavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>), according to which, upon
liberation and the cessation of ordinary forms of consciousness, a
pure ninth form of consciousness arises. The doctrine is often seen as
an attempt to synthesise Yog&#257;c&#257;ra and
<em>tath&#257;gatagarbha</em>
 thought.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The authors and works discussed so far belong to the branch of
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra that draws more directly on the teachings and
methods of Asa&#7749;ga and Vasubandhu. The other branch, often
regarded as a later stage in the development of Yog&#257;c&#257;ra, is
the logico-epistemological (<em>pram&#257;&#7751;av&#257;da</em>)
tradition, associated with the works of Dign&#257;ga and
Dharmak&#299;rti. Their doctrinal standpoint cannot be easily
classified as Yog&#257;c&#257;ra since they put forward arguments in
favour of both Yog&#257;c&#257;ra and Sautr&#257;ntika positions
(hence, they are sometimes called
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra-Sautr&#257;ntikas). The Yog&#257;c&#257;ra stance,
moreover, is less prevalent or conspicuous in their works, insofar as
they either formulate their epistemological and metaphysical views in
a way that is compatible with both realists and idealists, or even (at
least provisionally) assume the mind-independent existence of the
objects of perception (Siderits 2007: 208&ndash;209; Carpenter 2014:
170; Kellner 2017: 311&ndash;312). This does not necessarily mean,
however, that Dign&#257;ga and Dharmak&#299;rti eschewed in their
final positions the sort of idealism often espoused by other
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra texts (see the entry on
 <a href="../dharmakiirti/">Dharmak&#299;rti</a>).
 According to scholars, such as Dunne (2004: 53&ndash;79),
Dharmak&#299;rti, for instance, expresses his philosophical views at
various levels of accuracy&mdash;an approach termed &ldquo;sliding
scales of analysis&rdquo;&mdash;the highest of which is represented by
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra idealism.</p>

<p>
Dign&#257;ga&rsquo;s <em>magnum opus</em> is the
<em>Pram&#257;&#7751;asamuccaya</em>(<em>v&#7771;tti</em>)
(&ldquo;Compendium on the Means of Valid Cognition with
Commentary&rdquo;), which sets out his views on logic and
epistemology. One of Dign&#257;ga&rsquo;s most important contributions
to Buddhist philosophy is held to be his analysis of inferential
validity, by virtue of which he is often regarded as the formaliser of
Buddhist logic. Dign&#257;ga&rsquo;s arguments in favour of the
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra idealist position are found in his
<em>&#256;lambanapar&#299;k&#7779;&#257;</em> (&ldquo;Investigation of
the Percept&rdquo;), a concise work of eight verses and a brief
auto-commentary. The treatise aims to prove that the object of
cognition cannot be an external entity. Rather, what we perceive (and
what causes our perceptions) is only the form or appearance of an
object within cognition itself.</p>

<p>
Dharmak&#299;rti, Dign&#257;ga&rsquo;s successor, is regarded as the
author of seven treatises, many of which are inspired by
Dign&#257;ga&rsquo;s ideas. His most famous works are the
<em>Pram&#257;&#7751;av&#257;rttika</em> (&ldquo;Commentary on the
Means of Valid Cognition&rdquo;) and the
<em>Pram&#257;&#7751;avini&#347;caya</em> (&ldquo;Ascertainment of the
Means of Valid Cognition&rdquo;). The former is a vast but unfinished
text commenting and expanding on Dign&#257;ga&rsquo;s
<em>Pram&#257;&#7751;asamuccaya</em>. The latter deals with analogous
topics in logic and epistemology to those discussed in the
<em>Pram&#257;&#7751;av&#257;rttika</em>, but in a more concise and
organised way. Both works present arguments in favour of
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra idealism. With regard to Dharmak&#299;rti&rsquo;s
contributions to other cardinal Yog&#257;c&#257;ra issues, it is
important to mention his treatise against solipsism, the
<em>Sa&#7747;t&#257;n&#257;ntarasiddhi</em> (&ldquo;Proof of Other
Mental
 Continua&rdquo;).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Dign&#257;ga and Dharmak&#299;rti&rsquo;s thesis that cognition
involves a representational form or image (<em>&#257;k&#257;ra</em>)
of an object (Kellner 2017: 312&ndash;313) was particularly
influential and controversial among later proponents of the
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra doctrines. This view was adopted, for instance, by
the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra philosopher J&ntilde;&#257;na&#347;r&#299;mitra
(c. 11<sup>th</sup> century CE) in his
<em>S&#257;k&#257;rasiddhi&#347;&#257;stra</em> (&ldquo;Proof of the
Form-Possession View&rdquo;) and
<em>S&#257;k&#257;rasa&#7747;grahas&#363;tra</em> (&ldquo;A Summary of
the Form-Possession View&rdquo;).
J&ntilde;&#257;na&#347;r&#299;mitra&rsquo;s &ldquo;with-form&rdquo;
(<em>s&#257;k&#257;ra</em>) thesis was formulated in response to
Ratn&#257;kara&#347;&#257;nti&rsquo;s (c. late 10<sup>th</sup> to
early 11<sup>th</sup> century CE) &ldquo;without-form&rdquo;
(<em>nir&#257;k&#257;ra</em>) interpretation of Yog&#257;c&#257;ra.
While both agreed that, in the light of the <em>cittam&#257;tra</em>
doctrine, there are no real, mind-independent objects, they disagreed
about the ultimate reality of the forms or images that appear within
cognition itself. Ratn&#257;kara&#347;&#257;nti assumed that these
forms or images are ultimately unreal, whereas
J&ntilde;&#257;na&#347;r&#299;mitra claimed that they actually exist
(McCrea 2019). It is also important to mention
J&ntilde;&#257;na&#347;r&#299;mitra&rsquo;s disciple, Ratnak&#299;rti
(c. 11<sup>th</sup> century CE), amongst the proponents of
Dign&#257;ga and Dharmak&#299;rti&rsquo;s tradition. In contrast to
Dharmak&#299;rti&rsquo;s efforts to dispel the charge of solipsism
levelled against the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra view, Ratnak&#299;rti rejects
the ultimate existence of other minds in his famous
<em>Sant&#257;n&#257;ntarad&#363;&#7779;a&#7751;a</em>.</p>

<p>
Attempts were made to harmonise the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra teachings with
other branches of Buddhist thought not only in relation to the
<em>tath&#257;gatagarbha</em> and Sautr&#257;ntika doctrines but also
Madhyamaka. &#346;&#257;ntarak&#7779;ita and his disciple
Kamala&#347;&#299;la (both dated to the c. 8<sup>th</sup> century CE)
are often referred to as the &ldquo;great synthesisers&rdquo; of
Madhyamaka and Yog&#257;c&#257;ra. In contrast to earlier
M&#257;dhyamikas who were ardent critics of the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra
doctrines, &#346;&#257;ntarak&#7779;ita&rsquo;s
<em>Madhyamak&#257;la&#7747;k&#257;ra</em> (&ldquo;Ornament of the
Middle Way&rdquo;) and Kamala&#347;&#299;la&rsquo;s
<em>Madhyamak&#257;loka</em> (&ldquo;Illumination of the Middle
Way&rdquo;) consider Yog&#257;c&#257;ra to be a provisional teaching,
effective in overcoming certain misconceptions about reality and
preparing practitioners for the realisation of the &ldquo;more
profound&rdquo; Madhyamaka doctrine of universal emptiness. The
position adopted by &#346;&#257;ntarak&#7779;ita and
Kamala&#347;&#299;la is described by Tibetan doxographers as
&ldquo;Yog&#257;c&#257;ra-Sv&#257;tantrika-Madhyamaka&rdquo;
(Sv&#257;tantrika-Madhyamaka being one of the two main sub-schools of
Madhyamaka, along with
 Pr&#257;sa&#7749;gika-Madhyamaka).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h2 id="YogcPhilPsycNewModeMind">2. Yog&#257;c&#257;ra philosophical psychology: A new model of the mind</h2>

<p>
As its alternative names show, the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra tradition was
particularly interested in understanding the nature, structure and
various functions of consciousness. Indeed, one of the school&rsquo;s
most prominent philosophical innovations consists in the development
of a new model of the mind. Traditional Abhidharma psychology posits
six types of consciousness: one for each external sense modality,
i.e., the visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory and tactile
consciousness, and one for mentation (<em>manas</em>), i.e., the
mental consciousness (<em>manovij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>). Buddhists
attribute diverse functions to the <em>manas</em>. For instance, it
apprehends a range of mental objects (e.g., memories, imaginations),
but it also has access to the sensory data supplied by the external
sense faculties, synthesising them into unified (mental) objects and
making various judgements about
 them.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup>
 In contrast to this traditional model, classical Yog&#257;c&#257;ra
distinguishes eight types of consciousness or
 cognition.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>
 In addition to the six forms of ordinary consciousness mentioned
above, they posited a seventh type, commonly referred to as defiled or
afflicted mind (<em>kli&#7779;&#7789;amanas</em>), and an eighth form
of consciousness, called store or substratum consciousness
(<em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>).</p>

<p>
The six forms of consciousness associated with the five sense organs
and the <em>manas</em> are often called &ldquo;manifesting&rdquo;,
&ldquo;arising&rdquo; or &ldquo;occurrent&rdquo; consciousnesses
(<em>prav&#7771;ttivij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>). On the one hand, the
term indicates the contrast between the six (ordinary) forms of
<em>vij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>, which become manifest in our cognitive
acts and operate in a supraliminal way, and the
<em>kli&#7779;&#7789;amanas</em> and the
<em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>, which operate in an
unmanifest, subliminal way. On the other hand, it also shows that
while the <em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em> functions
uninterruptedly throughout one&rsquo;s existence, the
<em>prav&#7771;ttivij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>s arise discontinuously (for
instance, they do not operate in deep sleep or deep meditation or when
their appropriate objects are not present). From this perspective, it
is not surprising that certain works (such as the
<em>Madhy&#257;ntavibh&#257;ga&#7789;&#299;k&#257;</em> or the
<em>Trisvabh&#257;vanirde&#347;a</em>) speak of not six but seven
<em>prav&#7771;ttivij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>s, including the
<em>kli&#7779;&#7789;amanas</em> as well as the six ordinary forms of
consciousness (Delhey 2016: 18&ndash;20). This classification
underlines that these seven forms of <em>vij&ntilde;&#257;na</em> have
the <em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>, or more precisely the
karmic seeds (<em>b&#299;ja</em>) contained in the
<em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>, as their source, and that they
arise only when their seeds are ready to ripen. The six forms of
consciousness are also sometimes referred to as the &ldquo;perception
of objects&rdquo; (e.g., <em>Tri&#7747;&#347;ik&#257;</em> verse 2)
since each of them emerges in conjunction with its respective object
(visible form, sound, etc.) or, in a more idealist-friendly
terminology, has the appearance of a well-defined object.</p>

<p>
It might be helpful to add at this point that the concept of
<em>vij&ntilde;&#257;na</em> is generally defined in Buddhist
philosophical sources as a cognition of an object. Accordingly, many
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra texts claim that the
<em>kli&#7779;&#7789;amanas</em> and the
<em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>, in addition to the six sensory
consciousnesses, are also object-directed or intentional mental
states. Otherwise, they could not be regarded as genuine forms of
cognition. In line with their subliminal functioning, their objects
(as opposed to the objects of ordinary perceptions) are vague or
difficult to determine. The <em>kli&#7779;&#7789;amanas</em> is
directed at the <em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em> as its object,
while the objects of the <em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em> are
often held to be the surrounding world
(<em>bh&#257;jana</em>/<em>bh&#257;janaloka</em>) and one&rsquo;s own
body (<em>&#257;&#347;raya</em> i.e.,
 &ldquo;basis&rdquo;).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="DefiMind">2.1 The defiled mind</h3>

<p>
The defiled mind, one of the new forms of <em>vij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>
introduced by the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra tradition, is responsible for our
mistaken belief in the self and our sense of personal identity. In
some Yog&#257;c&#257;ra texts, this layer of the mind is simply
referred to as <em>manas</em>, but insofar as it is always
characterised by the presence of four kinds of defilement
(<em>&#257;tmad&#7771;&#7779;&#7789;i</em>, i.e., false view of the
self; <em>&#257;tmamoha</em>, i.e., delusion about the self;
<em>&#257;tmam&#257;na</em>, i.e., self-conceit; and
<em>&#257;tmasneha</em>, i.e., self-love), it is often described as
&ldquo;defiled&rdquo; or &ldquo;afflicted&rdquo;
 (<em>kli&#7779;&#7789;a</em>).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup>
 The origin of the concept is difficult to determine. According to one
hypothesis, it goes back to early textual passages (e.g., in the
<em>Vini&#347;cayasa&#7747;graha&#7751;&#299;</em> section of the
<em>Yog&#257;c&#257;rabh&#363;mi</em>) that conceive of the
subliminally operating <em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em> as the
object of our subtle and innate self-related thoughts. This subliminal
process, arguably, called for the introduction of a separate form of
consciousness, the <em>kli&#7779;&#7789;amanas</em>, which clings to
the <em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em> and, in a similarly
subliminal way, conceptualises it as an ultimately real self
(Schmithausen 1987:
 151&ndash;153).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup>
 The reification of our notion of &ldquo;I&rdquo; into a distinct
stratum of consciousness (instead of associating it with other forms
of consciousness, including the <em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>
itself) was probably further inspired by the notion of
<em>aha&#7747;k&#257;ra</em> (egoism or literally
&ldquo;I-making&rdquo;) found in the classical Indian
S&#257;&#7747;khya philosophical tradition (Schmithausen 1987: 29,
151).</p>

<p>
Another incentive for introducing the concept might have been the
peculiar nature of the traditional <em>manas</em> (i.e., the sixth
sense faculty). In the Vaibh&#257;&#7779;ika Abhidharma tradition, an
important difference between the five sense consciousnesses and the
mental consciousness is that each of the former has a simultaneously
present sense faculty as its &ldquo;support&rdquo; or
&ldquo;basis&rdquo;
 (<em>&#257;&#347;raya</em>).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-16" id="ref-16">16</a>]</sup>
 Visual consciousness, for instance, comes into existence from a
simultaneously present eye faculty (and, of course, a visual object).
Such a simultaneous basis, however, is missing in the case of the
<em>manovij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>. The term <em>manas</em> was commonly
held to be a mere shorthand for the earlier moment of consciousness
that instigated or conditioned the present one. Mental consciousness
was, therefore, considered to be a (special) form of consciousness
that has only a &ldquo;past basis&rdquo;, the <em>manas</em>, but not
a simultaneously present
 one.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-17" id="ref-17">17</a>]</sup>
 While some Yog&#257;c&#257;ras were apparently unfazed by the lack of
a simultaneous basis for the <em>manovij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>, certain
authors and texts (e.g., the <em>Mah&#257;y&#257;nasa&#7747;graha</em>
or the <em>Prav&#7771;tti Portion</em> of the
<em>Yog&#257;c&#257;rabh&#363;mi</em>) regarded the
<em>kli&#7779;&#7789;amanas</em> as the simultaneous, faculty-like
basis of mental consciousness (Waldron 2003: 122&ndash;123; Kramer
2016b:
 160&ndash;161).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-18" id="ref-18">18</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The afflictive functioning of the defiled mind not only instigates a
mistaken sense of &ldquo;I&rdquo;, but also fundamentally determines
the way we conceive and even perceive the world. As the simultaneous
support of our conceptualising mental activities, the egoistic
tendencies of the <em>kli&#7779;&#7789;amanas</em> permeate the
manifesting consciousnesses
(<em>prav&#7771;ttivij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>), as a result of which we
habitually misconceive our experiences in terms of selves interacting
with independent objects. Since the defiled mind is the proximate
cause of our mistaken attitudes towards the self (and separate objects
it might appropriate), it is often depicted as the fundamental cause
of our entanglement in the cycle of existence
(<em>sa&#7747;s&#257;ra</em>). Certain texts, such as
Vasubandhu&rsquo;s <em>Tri&#7747;&#347;ik&#257;</em>, emphasise that
the <em>kli&#7779;&#7789;amanas</em> operates continuously, ceasing
only in exceptional states such as (1) liberation, (2) the
supramundane path (<em>lokottaram&#257;rga</em>), which refers to more
advanced practitioners, and (3) a very deep meditative state called
&ldquo;absorption into cessation&rdquo;
(<em>nirodhasam&#257;patti</em>), where all mental activities cease
except for the <em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>.</p>

<h3 id="StorSubsConsFunc">2.2 The store or substratum consciousness and its functions</h3>

<p>
The term <em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em> is commonly translated
as store or substratum
 consciousness.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-19" id="ref-19">19</a>]</sup>
 One of its roles, which warrants the translation &ldquo;store&rdquo;
(or sometimes &ldquo;storehouse&rdquo;) consciousness, is related to
the Buddhist notion of karma, i.e., that one&rsquo;s ethically
relevant intentional actions produce results in the future that
correspond to the moral nature of the actions. Scholars generally
maintain that the concept of <em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>
largely developed from Yog&#257;c&#257;ra attempts to solve common
Buddhist and Abhidharmic problems posed by the doctrine of no-self
(<em>an&#257;tman</em>) and the impermanent or momentary existence of
all conditioned phenomena (<em>dharma</em>). If a person does not have
an enduring self underlying their experiences, but is merely a bundle
of psychophysical elements that come and go in every single moment,
then how can we explain, for instance, personal identity or karmic
efficacy and responsibility? Relying on the theory of
<em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>, the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra answer
holds that actions produce karmic seeds (<em>b&#299;ja</em>) or
impressions (<em>v&#257;san&#257;</em>), i.e., potentialities or
dispositions for future experiences and perceptions, which are
retained, as in a sort of &ldquo;container&rdquo; or
&ldquo;store&rdquo;, in the <em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>
until they are ready to produce their
 effects.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-20" id="ref-20">20</a>]</sup>
 These perceptions, as we have seen, appear in the bifurcation of
subjects and objects due to the influence of the defiled mind.
According to the Yog&#257;c&#257;ras, the continuous operation of the
<em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em> grounds karmic continuity and
efficacy over both one and multiple lifetimes and ensures that karmic
results belong to the same personal &ldquo;continuum&rdquo; that
committed the action.</p>

<p>
While it cannot be ruled out that the
<em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em> was originally introduced to
cover multiple functions, certain scholars argue that its inception
can be traced back more specifically to problems raised by deep
meditative practice. Schmithausen (1987: 18) suggests that the passage
representing the starting point for the
<em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em> theory is found in the
<em>Sam&#257;hit&#257;</em> <em>Bh&#363;mi</em> section of the
<em>Yog&#257;c&#257;rabh&#363;mi</em>, which discusses the
<em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em> in relation to the meditative
state of &ldquo;absorption into cessation&rdquo;
 (<em>nirodhasam&#257;patti</em>).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-21" id="ref-21">21</a>]</sup>
 The temporary cessation of all conscious mental activity in
<em>nirodhasam&#257;patti</em> posed two interrelated challenges to
the proponents of mainstream Buddhist schools. First, insofar as
consciousness is regarded in the Buddhist tradition as (one of) the
bearer(s) of life, how can the meditator survive the absence of any
conscious activity? Secondly, where do ordinary forms of consciousness
re-emerge from after <em>nirodhasam&#257;patti</em> if there is no
immediately preceding moment of consciousness causing them? According
to the <em>Sam&#257;hit&#257;</em> <em>Bh&#363;mi</em>, the subliminal
<em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>, which abides or hides in the
sense faculties during meditation, functions even when all other
conscious states cease to
 operate.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-22" id="ref-22">22</a>]</sup>
 Due to the continuous operation of the
<em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>, the meditator can survive the
meditative state, and the manifesting consciousnesses
(<em>prav&#7771;ttivij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>s) can be reactivated from
the seeds contained in
 it.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-23" id="ref-23">23</a>]</sup>
 In a related biological role, the
<em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em> was also seen as the form of
consciousness that takes possession of a new life at the time of
conception, merging with (proto-)embryonic matter in the womb.
Moreover, its uninterrupted presence keeps the body alive throughout
one&rsquo;s existence, only withdrawing from it (with the body
becoming cold) at the time of death. Accordingly, the
<em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em> is the part of the being that
undergoes rebirth and forms a link between this life and the
 next.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-24" id="ref-24">24</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
As we have seen, in some Yog&#257;c&#257;ra texts (especially in the
<em>Yog&#257;c&#257;rabh&#363;mi</em>) the
<em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em> is placed in a realist
framework insofar as it supports and operates together with the
physical body. The concept, however, gains even more importance in an
idealist context by explaining how the causes of our perceptions can
be understood in purely mental terms. It is no longer necessary to
posit external objects as the causes of perceptions, since our
cognitions of objects can arise directly from the seeds ripened in the
<em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>. The ripening of these seeds
accounts for the appearance of the sensible world not only as a
private but also as an intersubjective experience. While critics of
the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra tradition doubted that a purely mental reality
can accommodate intersubjectivity, that is, our conviction that
multiple individuals at the same place and time can agree on the
content of their experiences, certain Yog&#257;c&#257;ra works
emphasise that our similar experiences are produced by seeds common to
all relevant <em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>s. These common
seeds, in turn, are the result of previous shared actions and
experiences stretching back through beginningless time. Thus the world
we experience in an intersubjective manner is determined by a complex
causal process involving many minds interacting in a variety of
 ways.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-25" id="ref-25">25</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Since the <em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em> performs some of the
traditional roles attributed to the self (<em>&#257;tman</em>) in the
Indian tradition (e.g., ensures personal identity, karmic
responsibility, undergoes rebirth), it is not surprising that the
Yog&#257;c&#257;ras were often accused of resuscitating the idea of an
unchanging, permanent self rejected by all Buddhist traditions. Even
though the <em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em> is mistakenly
conceived by the defiled mind as a substantial self, the
Yog&#257;c&#257;ras insisted that it is in fact nothing like the
non-Buddhist concept of the <em>&#257;tman</em>. Rather, in works such
as the <em>Sa&#7747;dhinirmocana S&#363;tra</em>, the
<em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em> is often likened to a river.
Just as a river flows in an unbroken stream while its body of water is
constantly changing, so too the <em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>
is understood as an uninterrupted series of transitory karmic seeds,
traces or
 tendencies.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-26" id="ref-26">26</a>]</sup>
 Moreover, several Yog&#257;c&#257;ra works stress that the
<em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em> ceases upon the attainment of
liberation, entailing that it is by no means an eternal substance, as
the non-Buddhist <em>&#257;tman</em> is standardly thought to
 be.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-27" id="ref-27">27</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Some of the theoretical benefits of the
<em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em> discussed above overlap with
the proofs given by Yog&#257;c&#257;ra authors for the existence of
such a layer of consciousness. Perhaps the best known is the list of
eight proofs found in the so-called <em>Proof Portion</em> of the
 <em>Yog&#257;c&#257;rabh&#363;mi</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-28" id="ref-28">28</a>]</sup>
 Some of these concern the
<em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>&rsquo;s relation to the
physical body. For instance, they point out that without the existence
of the <em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em> we could not explain how
rebirth and death occur. It is only this form of consciousness that
can take possession of a new existence and physical body at the
beginning of life, and consequently it must be the same entity that
gradually abandons the body at the time of death. As seen above, we
would also be unable to explain how the body is kept alive throughout
one&rsquo;s life, especially in apparently unconscious states such as
<em>nirodhasam&#257;patti</em> (or deep sleep and fainting, as added
by Vasubandhu&rsquo;s <em>Pa&ntilde;caskandhaka</em>), or how there
can be bodily sensations in meditation (e.g., the feeling of ease, see
Yamabe 2018) when ordinary tactile perception is not
 functioning.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-29" id="ref-29">29</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Another proof, which is unrelated to the aforementioned bodily
aspects, shows that there has to be an
<em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em> that conditions the emergence
of our various ordinary forms of consciousness, since these cannot be
one another&rsquo;s &ldquo;seeds&rdquo; or conditioning factors. The
justification relies on the observation that successive
<em>prav&#7771;ttivij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>s sometimes have dissimilar
or even incompatible qualities, for example, when a virtuous or
wholesome moment of thought immediately follows a non-virtuous or
unwholesome one. <em>Prav&#7771;ttivij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>s with such
dissimilar qualities, however, cannot condition each other&rsquo;s
emergence, so there must be a morally neutral
(<em>avy&#257;k&#7771;ta</em>) entity, namely the
<em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>, which holds the seeds of
virtuous, non-virtuous, and neutral
<em>prav&#7771;ttivij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>s alike, and enables them to
be actualised under the right circumstances (Griffiths 1986: 101;
Schmithausen 1987: 132&ndash;133).</p>

<p>
The remaining proofs concern the simultaneous presence of multiple
consciousnesses. In order to adequately account for the apparently
simultaneous presence of multiple sense cognitions and, relatedly, for
the phenomenal synchronic unity of our consciousness (i.e., that our
experiences of particular qualities and things at a given time are not
disparate, but appear to us as if they were aspects of a unified
conscious state), we must posit the existence of the
<em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>, which allows for the seeds of
multiple <em>prav&#7771;ttivij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>s to ripen
simultaneously (Chadha 2015; Schmithausen 1987: 45&ndash;46). This
view is in stark contrast to the Abhidharmic unisensory model of
consciousness, according to which we cannot see or hear at the same
time, but these cognitions merely follow each other in rapid
succession.</p>

<p>
The Yog&#257;c&#257;ra thesis of the simultaneity of multiple
consciousnesses has (at least) three important aspects. First, it
allows for a multisensory view of perception, according to which
several <em>prav&#7771;ttivij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>s, such as visual or
auditory consciousnesses, can arise simultaneously, for instance, I
can see the red colour of the kettle and hear its whistling sound at
the same time. Moreover, the fact that a particular object or quality
can be perceived simultaneously by both the sensory consciousnesses
and the mental consciousness (<em>manovij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>)
explains why our mental cognitions of that thing (e.g., our immediate
thoughts and judgements about it, or our conative attitudes towards
it) are so clear or vivid. If, in keeping with the Abhidharmic
unisensory model, the mental cognition of an object arises later than,
say, the visual cognition of that object, then the mental cognition
would be directed at a past object. But such cognition of a past
object is basically an act of remembering. Memories, however, are
typically less clear or vivid than the conative or cognitive contents
of the <em>manovij&ntilde;&#257;na</em> we normally experience in
sense perception (Griffiths 1986: 100&ndash;101; Chadha 2015:
 752).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-30" id="ref-30">30</a>]</sup>
 Secondly, the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra simultaneity thesis encompasses the
functioning of three layers of consciousness:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>the intermittent <em>prav&#7771;ttivij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>s (both
sensory and mental) directed at various objects,</li>

<li>the <em>kli&#7779;&#7789;amanas</em>, which permeates these with a
mistaken cognition of the &ldquo;I&rdquo;, and</li>

<li>the continuously operating <em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>,
with its twofold operation of subliminally perceiving the surrounding
world and one&rsquo;s own body.</li>
</ol>

<p>
According to the Yog&#257;c&#257;ras, this (fourfold) complexity of
our mental processes in each ordinary moment of life cannot be
explained in terms of a &ldquo;one-dimensional&rdquo; Abhidharma
model. Thirdly, the ability of the
<em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em> to condition the simultaneous
emergence of other forms of consciousness is essential from a
soteriological perspective as well. While this point is not mentioned
among the eight proofs enumerated in the
<em>Yog&#257;c&#257;rabh&#363;mi</em>, other texts such as
Vasubandhu&rsquo;s <em>Pa&ntilde;caskandhaka</em> or
Sthiramati&rsquo;s
<em>Pa&ntilde;caskandhakavibh&#257;&#7779;&#257;</em> emphasise that
without a multi-layered mind the mental defilements
(<em>kle&#347;a</em>) that hinder liberation could not be eliminated.
This is because a defilement and its counteragent cannot be active in
the same instance of consciousness. Therefore, as the argument goes,
we need to posit a multi-layered mind where the counteracting mental
states are able to act directly on the defilements that are in a
dispositional &ldquo;seed&rdquo; state in the
 <em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-31" id="ref-31">31</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h2 id="CittDoctPrioMind">3. The <em>cittam&#257;tra</em> doctrine: The priority of the mind</h2>

<h3 id="IdeaDeba">3.1 The idealism debate</h3>

<p>
Arguably, the most famous and, at the same time, hotly debated
doctrine of the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra tradition in modern scholarship is
the <em>cittam&#257;tra</em> or <em>vij&ntilde;aptim&#257;tra</em>
teaching. While not every Yog&#257;c&#257;ra work advocates the mind-
or cognition-only position in any robust sense, the strand of
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra thought that does is frequently referred to in the
secondary literature by the neologism
&ldquo;Yog&#257;c&#257;ra-Vij&ntilde;&#257;nav&#257;da&rdquo;. The
doctrine has often been understood to encapsulate the Western
conception of idealism, i.e., the philosophical position that assigns
some fundamental priority to the mind or cognition over the
(apparently external or material) sensible world (for various Western
variants of idealism, see the entry on
 <a href="../idealism/">idealism</a>).</p>
 
<p>
When considering possible ways to spell out this priority in the
context of Yog&#257;c&#257;ra it is useful, and customary, to
distinguish between three levels of interpretation: the level of (i)
the objects of perception, (ii) the causes of our perceptions, and
(iii) ultimate reality (for slightly different three-level analyses,
see Finnigan 2017 and the entry on
 <a href="../vasubandhu/">Vasubandhu</a>).
 While, as we shall see, it is quite difficult to determine whether
the doctrine of &ldquo;mere consciousness&rdquo; holds true at the
ultimate level of reality, the priority of mind at the first two
levels seems fairly straightforward. According to the
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra-Vij&ntilde;&#257;nav&#257;da position, the objects
constituting the (apparently external) sensible world are
mind-dependent in the sense that they are nothing but appearances in
our cognitions, that is to say, they exist only insofar as they are
cognised. The proponents of
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra-Vij&ntilde;&#257;nav&#257;da also hold that our
cognitions of sensible objects have a mental cause, since they arise
directly from the <em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>&rsquo;s
seeds. Nevertheless, there is considerable disagreement over the exact
ontological implications of these views.</p>

<p>
More specifically, Yog&#257;c&#257;ra has standardly been understood
as either ontological or epistemological idealism (for an overview of
these positions, see Trivedi 2005; Kellner and Taber 2014; the entries
on
 <a href="../mind-indian-buddhism/">mind in Indian Buddhist philosophy</a>
 and
 <a href="../vasubandhu/">Vasubandhu</a>;
 note that a significant part of the idealism debate concerns
Vasubandhu&rsquo;s Yog&#257;c&#257;ra works). According to both
readings, the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra-Vij&ntilde;&#257;nav&#257;da position
states that material hypotheses fail to account for the occurrence and
appearance of our perceptions, and that we need to appeal to our
mind&rsquo;s own activities to explain the features of our
experiences. The epistemological reading, however, emphasises that
this does not necessarily mean that there is nothing beyond our
perceptions. On this interpretation, the proponents of
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra-Vij&ntilde;&#257;nav&#257;da merely argued that
what we are aware of and have access to in cognition is nothing more
than the very contents of our own minds caused, or at least deeply
influenced, by the <em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>&rsquo;s
seeds. (Despite some important differences, interpretations along
these lines have been offered, for example, by Wayman 1965;
Kochumuttom 1982; Hayes 1988; Harris 1991; Oetke 1992; and King 1998.)
This interpretation might be compared to the &ldquo;transcendental
idealism&rdquo; of Immanuel Kant, who, despite his idealist view of
the <em>sensible</em> world, posited a mind-independent reality that,
as it exists in itself, is completely inaccessible to us. A variant of
this epistemological approach, by contrast, holds that
Yog&#257;c&#257;ras completely bracket the ontological questions
behind the appearances we perceive. Proponents of this interpretation
appeal to the Yog&#257;c&#257;ras&rsquo; apparent reluctance to deal
with metaphysics, engaging only with what can be described in
experiential terms. Accordingly, they prefer to construe their views
through the lens of (Husserlian) phenomenology (Lusthaus 2002;
Garfield 2015a: 186&ndash;189 and 2015b).</p>

<p>
The other, traditionally more dominant route is to interpret
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra-Vij&ntilde;&#257;nav&#257;da as ontological
idealism, at least on the basis of certain works such as
Vasubandhu&rsquo;s <em>Vi&#7747;&#347;ik&#257;</em> or the
<em>Trisvabh&#257;vanirde&#347;a</em> (e.g., Griffiths 1986:
82&ndash;84; Kapstein 1988; Garfield 2002; 152&ndash;169; Schmithausen
2005a, 2005b; Siderits 2007: 147; Arnold 2008: 15&ndash;18, 2021:
103&ndash;107; Kellner &amp; Taber 2014; Westerhoff 2018:
 176&ndash;179).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-32" id="ref-32">32</a>]</sup>
 Ontological idealism differs from epistemological idealism and
phenomenology in that it straightforwardly rejects anything beyond our
minds and mental states. In other words, the idealist position they
advocate also involves immaterialism, that is, the denial of the
existence of a material
 world.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-33" id="ref-33">33</a>]</sup>
 But even if we accept that
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra-Vij&ntilde;&#257;nav&#257;da authors questioned the
mind-independence of reality, it is still controversial whether
labelling their view as ontological <em>idealism</em> is helpful or
illuminating. As many have noted, we are dealing with a peculiarly
<em>Buddhist</em> form of idealism. These peculiarities mainly concern
the third level of interpretation: the nature of ultimate reality.
Although the Yog&#257;c&#257;ras often emphasise that consciousness
really or fundamentally exists, it is not to be understood (in line
with the Buddhist <em>an&#257;tman</em> or no-self doctrine) as either
an individual or a universal mental <em>substance</em>, as we
typically find in the works of Western idealist philosophers. In
particular, the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra concept of mind differs equally
from Berkeley&rsquo;s perceiving souls and Hegel&rsquo;s absolute
spirit (not to mention the theistic connotations of these Western
theories, which are generally alien to the Buddhist
 tradition).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-34" id="ref-34">34</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Moreover, Yog&#257;c&#257;ra authors rejected the subject-object
(<em>gr&#257;haka-gr&#257;hya</em>) duality of consciousness at the
ultimate level of reality. Non-duality can be understood in two ways:
first, that there is no object independent of consciousness, construed
as a cognising &ldquo;subject&rdquo;; second, that neither the
objective nor the subjective side of experience is ultimately real
(Gold 2006). This latter interpretation is sometimes developed into a
full-blown illusionism about consciousness, claiming that, according
to the Yog&#257;c&#257;ras&rsquo; final position, the act of
consciousness itself, with all its phenomenal features, is only a
conceptual construct or cognitive illusion with no foundation in
reality (see Garfield 2016; Chaturvedi 2024). From this perspective,
the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra position would bear similarities to the
Madhyamaka view of the ultimate emptiness of consciousness. Others,
however, have argued that the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra denial of non-duality
(even in the second sense) does not rule out the ultimate existence of
an ineffable non-dual form of consciousness (Williams 2009:
95&ndash;96). That this non-dual form of consciousness transcends our
conceptual and linguistic capacities has also made scholars (such as
Gold 2011 [2022]) reluctant to explicitly classify Yog&#257;c&#257;ra
as &ldquo;standard&rdquo; ontological idealism. Although
<em>mental</em> predicates come closest to what reality is ultimately
like, even these fail to do justice to its intrinsic nature.</p>

<h3 id="ThreNatuTrisDoct">3.2 The three natures (<em>trisvabh&#257;va</em>) doctrine</h3>

<p>
Some of these subtleties of the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra position are
expressed through a theoretical framework called the doctrine of three
natures (<em>trisvabh&#257;va</em>) (for a detailed analysis of the
theory see Garfield 2002: 128&ndash;151; D&rsquo;Amato 2005; Williams
2009: 88&ndash;92; Gold 2015: 148&ndash;169; Brennan 2018). According
to the doctrine, all phenomena have three natures: (1) a
&ldquo;constructed&rdquo; or &ldquo;imagined nature&rdquo;
(<em>parikalpita-svabh&#257;va</em>); (2) a &ldquo;dependent
nature&rdquo; (<em>paratantra-svabh&#257;va</em>); and (3) a
&ldquo;perfected nature&rdquo;
(<em>parini&#7779;panna-svabh&#257;va</em>). The imagined nature is
the way things appear to us as ordinary, unenlightened beings. More
specifically, it refers to our abovementioned misconceptions about the
real existence of subjects and objects. As, for instance, the
<em>Sa&#7747;dhinirmocana S&#363;tra</em> suggests, the imagined
nature is related to our use of language, insofar as we ordinarily
assume that the structure of the world is correctly represented by our
linguistic conventions distinguishing between subjects, objects,
properties, their relations, etc. The dependent nature is explained as
the fact that our perceptions of imagined phenomena arise depending on
various causes and conditions. These causes are often identified with
the <em>&#257;layavij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>, or more precisely the
seeds contained therein (e.g., <em>Trisvabh&#257;vanirde&#347;a</em>
verse 29). The perfected nature, in turn, refers to the ultimate
nature of phenomena, commonly described by the term
<em>tathat&#257;</em>, i.e., &ldquo;suchness&rdquo; or
&ldquo;thusness&rdquo; (e.g., <em>Tri&#7747;&#347;ik&#257;</em> verses
24&ndash;25). In Yog&#257;c&#257;ra works such as Asa&#7749;ga&rsquo;s
<em>Mah&#257;y&#257;nasa&#7747;graha</em> or Vasubandhu&rsquo;s
<em>Tri&#7747;&#347;ik&#257;</em> the &ldquo;perfected nature&rdquo;
is glossed as the absence of the imagined nature from the dependent
nature. Accordingly, one grasps the perfected nature as a result of
sustained meditative practice by realising that imagined entities
(such as subjects and objects) are unreal products or superimpositions
of the mind&rsquo;s conceptualising activity.</p>

<p>
It must be noted that while <em>svabh&#257;va</em> (intrinsic nature
or existence) is a key concept in Abhidharma philosophy, the
three-nature analysis is not meant to be an endorsement of the
Abhidharma metaphysics of ultimately real <em>dharma</em>s. On the
contrary, in keeping with the ethos of the Mah&#257;y&#257;na, its
purpose is to dispel the misconception that phenomena, as conceived by
ordinary people and even by the more refined view of the
&#256;bhidharmikas, have an intrinsic existence. Some
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra sources (e.g., <em>Tri&#7747;&#347;ik&#257;</em>
verses 23&ndash;24) seek to emphasise this by characterising the three
natures as three non-natures or naturelessnesses
(<em>ni&#7717;svabh&#257;vat&#257;</em>), that is, three ways in which
the Abhidharmic sense of <em>svabh&#257;va</em> is absent from
phenomena. Accordingly, the imagined nature is naturelessness in that
phenomena do not have the nature or mind-independent properties they
appear to have (such as extension, solidity, colour). The dependent
nature is naturelessness in the sense that phenomena are not causally
independent, because they depend on something external to themselves,
especially the cognising mind. Finally, the perfected nature is the
realisation of naturelessness itself, defined as the absence of the
imagined from the dependent (Garfield 2002: 109&ndash;127).</p>

<p>
While this description of the perfected nature sounds rather negative,
on the standard reading it presupposes the ultimate reality of a basis
(i.e. the flow of experiences or the dependent nature), which is empty
of false conceptualisation, non-dual, and
 ineffable.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-35" id="ref-35">35</a>]</sup>
 Thus the doctrine of three natures, despite its rebuttal of the
<em>svabh&#257;va</em> metaphysics of Abhidharma, reveals a
fundamental agreement between the Abhidharma and Yog&#257;c&#257;ra
traditions: namely, that there must be something that serves as the
ultimate foundation of reality (a view often referred to as
ontological foundationalism). For Abhidharma, this foundation is the
<em>dharma</em>s; for Yog&#257;c&#257;ra, it is consciousness. As the
Yog&#257;c&#257;ras argue, something has to exist fundamentally to
ground our false superimpositions. Such an approach would set the
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra position in stark contrast to Madhyamaka
anti-foundationalism. Accordingly, the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra position in
general, and the theory of three natures in particular, are
characterised by Yog&#257;c&#257;ra sources such as the
<em>Sa&#7747;dhinirmocana S&#363;tra</em> as the ultimately correct
doctrine, construed as a middle way between the
&ldquo;nihilistic&rdquo; interpretation of emptiness attributed to the
Madhyamaka and the Abhidharmic reification of phenomena (on the
complex relationship between Yog&#257;c&#257;ra and Madhyamaka, see
for instance Harris 1991: especially 102&ndash;131; King 1994; and the
relevant contributions in Garfield &amp; Westerhoff 2015: especially
Thakch&ouml;e 2015).</p>

<h3 id="OrigYogcIdea">3.3 The origins of Yog&#257;c&#257;ra idealism</h3>

<p>
Despite the widespread association of Yog&#257;c&#257;ra with
idealism, it is important to stress that not every Yog&#257;c&#257;ra
scripture or treatise advocates the <em>cittam&#257;tra</em> or
<em>vij&ntilde;aptim&#257;tra</em> doctrine. As scholars (Griffiths
1986: 82&ndash;84; Schmithausen 1987: 32&ndash;33 and 297, n. 221;
Schmithausen 2005b: 244&ndash;245; Kellner 2017: 307) pointed out, the
mind-only doctrine is conspicuously absent from the earliest strata of
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra literature. The
<em>Yog&#257;c&#257;rabh&#363;mi</em>, for instance, mostly takes for
granted the realist ontology of the mainstream Buddhist traditions.
According to some scholars, we find some inconsistency in adopting an
ontological idealist position even in the works of considerably later
authors, such as Sthiramati, whose terminology and statements
sometimes appear to be incompatible with idealism (Schmithausen 1987:
298 n.
 222).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-36" id="ref-36">36</a>]</sup>
 It should be added, however, that the
<em>Yog&#257;c&#257;rabh&#363;mi</em> corpus does contain some claims
or allusions that can be seen as precursors of idealism. These include
for instance the ideas that things are mere designations
(<em>praj&ntilde;apti</em>), that objects with their characteristics
are products of false conceptualisation (<em>vikalpa</em>), or that
meditative objects are purely mental in nature. This latter remark
contrasts with the realist attitude towards the objects of meditation
that prevails elsewhere in the work, where they are regarded as subtle
material forms perceivable only by the mental cognition (Schmithausen
2005b: 245&ndash;246).</p>

<p>
Scholars have offered various hypotheses to explain the origins of
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra idealism. Griffiths (1986: 82) and Schmithausen
(2005b: 246), for instance, argue that some of the core teachings of
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra, especially its idealist philosophy, grew out of
sustained contemplation of the nature of meditative experience rather
than mere theoretical speculation. This is suggested by the earliest
extant Yog&#257;c&#257;ra source that endorses idealism and uses the
term <em>vij&ntilde;aptim&#257;tra</em> to express it, the
<em>Sa&#7747;dhinirmocana S&#363;tra</em> (Schmithausen 2005b:
 245&ndash;246).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-37" id="ref-37">37</a>]</sup>
 Like the position mentioned above, the work adopts an idealist
approach to the ontological status of meditative objects, emphasising
that they are mental. The <em>Sa&#7747;dhinirmocana S&#363;tra</em>,
however, goes further and extrapolates this idea to the objects of
&ldquo;reality&rdquo;, considering them to be mere cognitions
(<em>vij&ntilde;aptim&#257;tra</em>) as
 well.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-38" id="ref-38">38</a>]</sup>
 But the centrality of meditative practice to the origins of
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra doctrines is not universally accepted. Other
scholars (e.g., Sharf 2005: 262&ndash;263) have argued that the role
attributed to meditative experience in the formation of Buddhist
philosophical theories is exaggerated, and the idealist tendencies of
the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra tradition can rather be traced back to
philosophical inquiries into the status, and ontological implications,
of misperceptions and
 dreams.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-39" id="ref-39">39</a>]</sup>
 Such a line of argument might be supported by the fact that
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra philosophers often appeal to various illusory or
hallucinatory states, including dreams and magic tricks, to illustrate
and demonstrate the coherence of their position that no cognition
whatsoever has a mind-independent object. Vasubandhu, for instance,
begins the <em>Twenty Verses</em> by likening our ordinary perceptual
experiences to a web of hairs or floaters that appear to people with
an eye disease.</p>

<p>
The development of Yog&#257;c&#257;ra idealism is also thought to have
been catalysed by the Abhidharmic Sautr&#257;ntika theory of
 perception.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-40" id="ref-40">40</a>]</sup>
 The Sautr&#257;ntikas rejected the Abhidharmic Vaibh&#257;&#7779;ika
direct realist theory of perception, according to which we are
directly acquainted with external objects in perception. Instead, as
is generally assumed, they favoured the representative realist (or
&ldquo;representationalist&rdquo;) view that one is in immediate
contact only with mental objects, which in turn represent the external
world (Dhammajoti 2007: 152&ndash;170; Siderits 2007: 130&ndash;137;
Westerhoff 2018:
 79&ndash;82).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-41" id="ref-41">41</a>]</sup>
 While external objects are still accepted as real according to the
Sautr&#257;ntika theory, we can only infer their existence and nature
from the resembling representations they cause. That
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra was influenced by the Sautr&#257;ntika critique of
Vaibh&#257;&#7779;ika direct realism is evident, for instance, from
verse 16 of Vasubandhu&rsquo;s <em>Vi&#7747;&#347;ik&#257;</em>. This
passage argues that the realist cannot appeal to perceptual knowledge
or direct acquaintance (<em>pratyak&#7779;a</em>) to prove the
existence of an external object. Since the cognitive processing of
sensory information takes time, once the mental cognition forms the
belief that the object is perceived, we are no longer directly aware
of the object itself, but, arguably, only an internal representation
of a past state of it. Moreover, given the doctrine of momentariness
widely accepted in the Abhidharma tradition, by the time we make the
judgement that &ldquo;this object is perceived by me&rdquo;, both the
visual consciousness and the visible object have already ceased to
exist. Hence, the allegedly mind-independent object the direct realist
knows through perception does not actually exist. This argument bears
certain similarities to the time-lag argument used against direct
realism in contemporary philosophy (Siderits 2007: 133&ndash;134, 169;
Mills 2017; Westerhoff 2018: 173). But if we have perceptual knowledge
only of unreal objects or mental representations, and the external
sense objects are merely inferred as the (prior) causes of our
perceptions, as the Sautr&#257;ntika position claims, then it seems
natural that Yog&#257;c&#257;ras would also raise questions about the
necessity or tenability of this inference, turning to an idealist or
phenomenological position.</p>

<h3 id="IdeaVasuTwenVers">3.4 Idealism in Vasubandhu&rsquo;s <em>Twenty Verses</em></h3>

<p>
As noted above, much of the idealism debate revolves around
determining the exact position proposed and defended in
Vasubandhu&rsquo;s
 <em>Vi&#7747;&#347;ik&#257;</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-42" id="ref-42">42</a>]</sup>
 One of the main clusters of arguments Vasubandhu puts forward in
favour of the mind-only position (in verses 2 to 4) is aimed at
demonstrating that the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra doctrine is a viable
explanation of our everyday experiences and, as such, can withstand
the realists&rsquo; criticisms. Vasubandhu&rsquo;s (hypothetical)
opponent gives three reasons why the presupposition of material
objects is necessary to explain the generally accepted features of our
experiences. The first objection is based on the observation that our
experiences are not random, but apparently follow the spatio-temporal
patterns in which external objects cause them. In other words, if the
objects we perceive were not mind-independent entities, or at least
were not caused by such things, then it would be unaccountable why our
perceptions of things occur at specific places and times. The second
objection relies on the intersubjective nature of our perceptions. The
opponent asks how multiple beings could have similar experiences at a
given place and time, if not because the same external objects are
present to all of them, causing their perceptions. The third objection
is based on the common-sense belief that external objects perform
various functions that merely mental or illusory objects cannot.
Specifically, the external objects we perceive bring about observable
changes in the world as well as in us; for instance one can feel full
after eating a real but not an illusory dinner. Vasubandhu replies by
arguing that these three conditions can equally be met by states in
which, as even the opponent should concede, no external objects are
involved. In dreams, for instance, objects can appear to us in
patterns of spatio-temporal determination. The problem of
intersubjectivity can be answered by appealing to the shared
experiences of <em>preta</em>s (hungry ghosts) and beings in hell, who
all undergo similar gruesome hallucinations or
 visions.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-43" id="ref-43">43</a>]</sup>
 Moreover, even unreal objects can produce real changes in our waking
life, as is the case with wet or erotic dreams (or, one might add,
 nightmares).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-44" id="ref-44">44</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Another important cluster of arguments is meant to show that no
materialist account of the sensible world is tenable. In verses 11 to
15 of the <em>Vi&#7747;&#347;ik&#257;</em>, Vasubandhu raises and
rejects various possible materialist accounts of the macrophysical
objects we perceive. These theories include both Buddhist and
non-Buddhist views; for instance Vasubandhu criticises the form of
atomism embraced by the Vaibh&#257;&#7779;ikas, as well as the
Vai&#347;e&#7779;ika theory that posits &ldquo;whole&rdquo; objects
over and above their (atomic or qualitative) parts. It is worth noting
that the broader context of this argumentation is the opponent&rsquo;s
contention that the Buddha himself taught the existence of external
objects. According to Vasubandhu&rsquo;s reply, the Buddha taught it
only as a conventional doctrine, and not as an ultimate truth, because
even our best material theories of objects, such as theories of atomic
agglomeration, turn out to be inconsistent with how we perceive the
 world.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-45" id="ref-45">45</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
According to a widespread reading of the <em>Twenty Verses</em>, the
first cluster of arguments aims only to show that the mind-only
doctrine is a viable alternative to realism as it can account for the
most important features of our ordinary experiences. Vasubandhu
attempts to establish the doctrine of mind-only in a more positive
manner only in the second cluster of arguments, where he argues that
there is no adequate physical or materialistic theory to explain our
experiences of the sensible world. His strategy is to show that, in
the absence of any viable alternative to explain our experiences, only
the mind-only teaching can be true. This line of argument is sometimes
called an inference to the best explanation (Gold 2011
 [2022]).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-46" id="ref-46">46</a>]</sup>
 On a slightly different reading (Kapstein 1988: 36&ndash;37),
Vasubandhu uses a <em>modus tollens</em> argument in verses 11 to 15
to show that atomism is necessary to maintain that there are
mind-independent, external objects, but atomism is false. Finnigan
(2017: 181) and Arnold (2008: 16&ndash;17 and 2021: 103&ndash;107)
also read Vasubandhu as aiming to prove the impossibility of external
objects in these verses. While most scholars believe that this cluster
of arguments implies an ontological idealist or immaterialist
position, there is an influential strand of interpretation that
disagrees, arguing that Vasubandhu is merely seeking to show the
untenability of materialist theories <em>as explanations of our
experiences.</em> For instance, Oetke (1992) contends that these
verses only prove that mind-independent objects cannot be the (direct)
objects of perception, but not that they do not exist at all.</p>

<p>
There are some further considerations that might support an
ontological idealist reading of the text. Many suggest that Vasubandhu
could argue for ontological idealism on the grounds that it is
rationally preferable to realism because, while it is equally capable
of explaining all the phenomena at hand, it is an ontologically
simpler or more parsimonious theory, appealing to fewer kinds of
 entities.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-47" id="ref-47">47</a>]</sup>
 This strategy, which Siderits (2007: 157&ndash;158) calls the
&ldquo;principle of lightness&rdquo;, appears most clearly in verses
6&ndash;7, where Vasubandhu challenges the realist opponent by saying
that if they are willing to admit that karma, construed as mental
intention, produces physical entities (e.g., hell guardians), which in
turn cause suffering in the mental streams of the tormented beings,
then why do they not eliminate the intermediate physical step? The
supposition that hell guardians are collective hallucinations in the
minds of tormented beings is a &ldquo;lighter&rdquo; theory of how our
experiences in hell come about, appealing only to <em>mental</em>
entities.</p>

<p>
Even if we do not rely specifically on the second cluster of
arguments, some scholars argue that we could still propose an
ontological idealist reading of the <em>Vi&#7747;&#347;ik&#257;</em>.
Kellner and Taber (2014), for instance, read Vasubandhu&rsquo;s
various arguments in the <em>Vi&#7747;&#347;ik&#257;</em> not only as
naturally suggesting such a position, but also as part of an overall
argumentative strategy that can be regarded as an argument from
ignorance. On this reading, with the first cluster of arguments
Vasubandhu shows that no <em>inference</em> drawn from the widely
accepted features of our perceptual experiences can prove the
existence of external objects. But since, as he goes on to show in the
second part of the work, none of the other epistemic instruments
(namely, <em>scriptural authority</em> in the second cluster of
arguments, and <em>perceptual acquaintance</em> in the rest of the
work) can demonstrate the existence of external objects, we have no
evidence whatsoever in favour of realism. On the basis that the
existence of external objects cannot be proved by any of the epistemic
instruments, Vasubandhu concludes that the mind-only position is
positively
 established.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-48" id="ref-48">48</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="LateIdeaArguDignDhar">3.5 Later idealist arguments: Dign&#257;ga and Dharmak&#299;rti</h3>

<p>
The tradition of Dign&#257;ga and Dharmak&#299;rti also contributed to
the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra defence of idealism. In denying that what we
perceive are material objects, Dign&#257;ga&rsquo;s
<em>&#256;lambanapar&#299;k&#7779;&#257;</em> can be seen as a
continuation and elaboration of Vasubandhu&rsquo;s idealist arguments
in the <em>Vi&#7747;&#347;ik&#257;</em>. The starting point of
Dign&#257;ga&rsquo;s argument is that in order for something to be
considered an object of perception (<em>&#257;lambana</em>) it must
fulfil two conditions. First, it has to cause the corresponding
percept. Second, it needs to exist in the way it appears to us in
consciousness, that is, be similar to the percept. Otherwise, we could
not distinguish it from other causes of perception that are equally
dissimilar to the object, such as the sense
 organs.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-49" id="ref-49">49</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Dign&#257;ga argues that neither a multiplicity of atoms nor their
agglomerations can satisfy these two conditions, therefore they cannot
be what we perceive. As for the causal criterion, his argument turns
on the mereological reductionist principle, frequently deployed by
&#256;bhidharmikas, that composite objects, including atomic
agglomerations, are ultimately unreal insofar as they can be analysed
into more fundamental constituents. On this basis, Dign&#257;ga infers
that atomic agglomerations cannot actually cause our perceptions,
since unreal things cannot cause anything. The alternative view that
the objects we cognise are multiplicities of atoms is also
problematic, as they are fundamentally dissimilar to how we perceive
the world around us. He points out that our perceptions appear in the
form of unified objects, such as cups and pots, as opposed to mere
multiplicities of atoms. Therefore, even though these atoms could
cause our perceptions, they cannot fulfil the resemblance
 criterion.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-50" id="ref-50">50</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
On the basis of such arguments, Dign&#257;ga concludes that the
objects of perception must be mental representations, because only
they can satisfy both criteria. It is important to note that in the
<em>&#256;lambanapar&#299;k&#7779;&#257;</em> Dign&#257;ga puts
forward a mental explanation for the origin of our perceptions,
proposing that the appearance of perception is actually caused by
impressions left in our minds by previous cognitions. Furthermore,
Dign&#257;ga makes it clear that the sense faculties are not material
either. While these remarks might suggest that Dign&#257;ga&rsquo;s
ultimate view is ontological idealism, it is noteworthy that he does
not explicitly assert it or call into question the coherence of
atomism as Vasubandhu does. While atoms are definitely not the objects
of our perceptions, they may, as far as the
<em>&#256;lambanapar&#299;k&#7779;&#257;</em>&rsquo;s arguments go,
exist outside our minds.</p>

<p>
Dharmak&#299;rti, too, offered important considerations in favour of
idealism. While he also recycles Dign&#257;ga&rsquo;s arguments about
the object of perception discussed above, his perhaps most famous
idealist argument is called <em>sahopalambhaniyama</em> inference,
variously translated as &ldquo;necessary joint cognition&rdquo;,
&ldquo;restriction to invariable co-cognition&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;certainty of [subject and object] being perceived
 together&rdquo;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-51" id="ref-51">51</a>]</sup>
 The argument appeals to the notion of self-awareness or reflexive
awareness (<em>svasa&#7747;vedana</em> or <em>svasa&#7747;vitti</em>),
which Dharmak&#299;rti borrows from Dign&#257;ga. According to them,
in any act of cognition, the mind is not only aware of an object but
also of itself cognising the object. Relying on this idea,
Dharmak&#299;rti&rsquo;s <em>sahopalambhaniyama</em> inference argues
that it is impossible to perceive an object, such as a blue patch,
without also being aware of the act of cognition itself. With this
move, Dharmak&#299;rti aims to undercut the realists&rsquo; attempt to
use perception to substantiate our belief in the existence of external
objects. To prove that there are external objects, they have to show
that these objects are distinct from our consciousness. However, as
Dharmak&#299;rti argues, this cannot be done by appealing to our
perceptions, since the objects of perception are always bound up with
 consciousness.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-52" id="ref-52">52</a>]</sup>
 Accordingly, the argument establishes an epistemological idealist
position: the mind only experiences itself and its own states, but
cannot cognitively access external objects <em>as external
objects</em>. Whether Dharmak&#299;rti&rsquo;s intention with the
<em>sahopalambhaniyama</em> inference was to make a leap from this
epistemological point to an ontological idealist position is
uncertain. While some scholars suggest that Dharmak&#299;rti seeks to
make this step, others contend that deriving metaphysical conclusions
from claims of inconceivability is a fallacious move that
Dharmak&#299;rti would have wanted to avoid (on this controversy, see
Finnigan 2017, 190).</p>

<h3 id="SoliOtheMind">3.6 Solipsism and other minds</h3>

<p>
As a consequence of their idealist tendencies, the Yog&#257;c&#257;ras
had to face the charge that their view leads to solipsism. In this
context, solipsism primarily refers to the ontological position that
only one&rsquo;s own mind exists but there are no other minds.
However, it can also be given an epistemological reading, according to
which we can only know the existence of our own minds (for a general
introduction to the problem of other minds and solipsism, see the
entry on
 <a href="../other-minds/">other minds</a>).
 Although the epistemological problem of other minds poses a challenge
to anyone who believes in some privileged access to our own minds, the
spectre of solipsism is often raised as a specific objection to
idealism, especially ontological idealism. It might be argued, for
instance, that the argument from ignorance Vasubandhu uses against the
existence of a mind-independent world might just as well work against
the existence of other minds. Indeed, in the light of the
Yog&#257;c&#257;ras&rsquo; rejection of the (subject-object) duality
of consciousness, solipsism seems particularly problematic for the
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra type of idealism (Westerhoff 2018: 164). This
rejection, as we have seen, concerns the false reification of the
apparently dual structure of an act of consciousness, that is, the
mistaken belief that there are separate perceiving subjects and
perceived objects. Non-duality seems to apply to anything that is an
&ldquo;object&rdquo; external to a &ldquo;subject&rdquo;, including
other minds as well as material objects. Moreover, the
Yog&#257;c&#257;ras&rsquo; apparent reliance on the principle of
lightness in motivating idealism raises another unique problem. Since
solipsism, which presupposes nothing but one&rsquo;s own mind, is the
lightest of all possible theories, why not prefer it to a form of
idealism that accepts the plurality of minds (Perrett 2017: 64)? It
might be worth noting that the epistemological idealist reading of
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra starts from a much better position here.</p>

<p>
Solipsism would be an unwelcome conclusion for
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra&mdash;no less than for any other Buddhist
tradition. Perhaps the most obvious problem is that solipsism is
incompatible with the Mah&#257;y&#257;na soteriological goal of
liberating all sentient beings. Accordingly, Vasubandhu and other
early Yog&#257;c&#257;ras never explicitly embraced solipsism. In
fact, they made statements to the contrary. In the <em>Twenty
Verses</em> (verse 21 and commentary), for instance, Vasubandhu claims
that the buddhas (non-dually) cognise other minds. He believes not
only that there are other minds, but also that they can act on each
other directly, e.g., harm or kill one another without having bodies
to mediate these
 actions.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-53" id="ref-53">53</a>]</sup>
 But even if Yog&#257;c&#257;ra can consistently include other minds
in its ontology, and justify why this assumption is not incompatible
with its idealist arguments against the existence of mind-independent
objects (such as the argument from ignorance or the principle of
lightness), the epistemological concern of how we can know that there
are other minds still needs to be addressed.</p>

<p>
The standard realist arguments for the existence of other minds rely
on observable physical actions (bodily and verbal). These actions are
appealed to as the basis for an analogical argument. Since I perceive
that my physical actions depend on my mental volitions, I reason
analogically that physical actions not caused by me are willed by some
other minds. One might also resort to an inference to the best
explanation to argue for the existence of other minds: the supposition
of other minds amounts to the best explanation of the physical actions
that are perceived but not caused by me. But by denying material
bodies, or our perceptual access to them, an idealist loses the only
observable sign that could indicate the presence of another mind.</p>

<p>
Dharmak&#299;rti addresses this very objection in his &ldquo;Proof of
Other Mental Continua&rdquo;
(<em>Sa&#7747;t&#257;n&#257;ntarasiddhi</em>).
Dharmak&#299;rti&rsquo;s overarching aim is to show that idealists can
use the same strategy as realists to argue for the existence of other
minds. Since neither the realist nor the idealist has direct
experience of other minds, they both have to appeal to inference. The
inference, as we saw above, starts from the observation that my
intentional actions are preceded and caused by my volitions. However,
I perceive that there are other actions that appear to be similarly
intentional, but are not preceded or caused by my volition. Assuming
that their cause is similar to that of my intentional actions, we can
conclude that there are other volitions, and therefore other minds,
causing these behaviours. This looks like a classic analogical
argument (Ganeri 2012: 202; Perrett 2017: 65). The main point
Dharmak&#299;rti makes is that what we actually use for this inference
is not the physical actions themselves, but merely the
<em>experiences</em> or <em>appearances</em> of them. Therefore, the
same strategy is available to the idealist as it is to the
realist.</p>

<p>
As for the certainty of this sort of inference, Dharmak&#299;rti
acknowledges that his analogical argument does not, <em>strictly
speaking</em>, prove the existence of other minds. It is only an
inductive argument that renders the conclusion <em>probable</em> that
some of our experiences are caused by the volitions of other minds.
This probability is sufficient for our everyday purposes, allowing us
to interact with others successfully. It might also help to address
our earlier concerns about how Yog&#257;c&#257;ras can include other
minds in their ontology in a way that is consistent with their denial
of material objects. While Yog&#257;c&#257;ras argue that the
existence of other minds can be shown to be probable, the assumption
of external objects as the basis of our perceptions is incoherent.
Another limitation of Dharmak&#299;rti&rsquo;s argument is that no
inference can reveal the intrinsic essence or nature of other minds.
This could only be achieved through direct perceptual acquaintance.
According to his epistemology, inferences concern only universals or
types, not specific individuals or tokens (Inami 2001: 467). So, while
we can validly conclude that there are <em>some</em> other minds
because there is a regular correspondence between observed actions and
volitions, we cannot know the specific characteristics of those minds.
In any event, none of these limitations affect
Dharmak&#299;rti&rsquo;s main argument that the realist is in no
better position than the idealist to prove the existence of other
minds.</p>

<p>
In the light of these caveats, it is not surprising that
Ratnak&#299;rti revisited the problem of other minds in the eleventh
century. In fact, in his
<em>Sant&#257;n&#257;ntarad&#363;&#7779;a&#7751;a</em>, he bites the
bullet, and accepts that we cannot prove that there are other minds.
He also seems to embrace ontological solipsism when arguing that other
minds do not exist at the ultimate level of reality. Ratnak&#299;rti
straightforwardly rejects the validity of Dharmak&#299;rti&rsquo;s
argument. Ratnak&#299;rti contends that a proper inference only works
if we have established that there is an invariable correspondence
(co-presence or co-absence) between an observed sign, in this case an
observed action, and its cause, the preceding volition. However, we
perceive this connection only in relation to our own minds and
actions, in a singular case. Since this correspondence between
observed action and preceding volition cannot be verified with respect
to others, we have no justification for establishing the existence of
other minds. The invalidity of Dharmak&#299;rti&rsquo;s inference,
according to Ratnak&#299;rti, comes down to the fact that the
volitions and mental states of others are imperceptible to us. If
mental states are <em>in principle</em> imperceptible, then we cannot
establish either the co-presence or the co-absence of mental states
and observable actions. As for co-presence, even if the mental state
is present, we can only perceive the action, not the mental state
itself. As for establishing co-absence, even when we do not perceive
an observable action, the mental state might still be there due to its
imperceptibility. Ratnak&#299;rti also considers the possibility that
others&rsquo; mental states are theoretically perceptible, but we
never actually perceive them. In this case, however, the very fact
that we do not perceive them indicates that they do not exist
(Chakrabarti 2011: 26&ndash;27; Kachru 2019: 71&ndash;72).</p>

<p>
A related argument proposed by Ratnak&#299;rti is that we cannot
distinguish instances of consciousness belonging to another mind from
those belonging to my own mind, because I only experience instances of
my own consciousness. According to Ratnak&#299;rti, our ability to
distinguish between two things depends on our cognitive access to both
things, but insofar as we only perceive our own minds, it is
impossible to distinguish between mental streams, that is, to
individuate other minds from our own (Chakrabarti 2011: 27; Perrett
2017: 66). Here Ratnak&#299;rti raises not merely the epistemological
concern of how we can know that there are other minds, but also the
problem of how we can form a coherent concept of other minds in the
first place. Besides the inconceivability of other minds, an important
implication of this argument, as some scholars have pointed out, is
that even our own consciousness cannot be individuated after all
(Ganeri 2007: 205&ndash;208 and 2012: 212&ndash;213; Westerhoff 2018:
165&ndash;166; Kachru 2019: 72&ndash;76). This interpretation also
makes it clear that Ratnak&#299;rti&rsquo;s argument should not be
interpreted as intending ontological solipsism in the sense that it is
only my own mind that exists (Inami 2001: 479, n. 32). In any event,
despite his apparent solipsism, Ratnak&#299;rti nevertheless accepted
the distinct existence of (other) minds at the conventional level,
thus maintaining the meaningfulness of the bodhisattva path and the
cultivation of compassion towards others.</p>

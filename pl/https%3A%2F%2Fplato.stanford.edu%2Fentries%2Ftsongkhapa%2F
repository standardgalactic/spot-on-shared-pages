<h1>Tsongkhapa</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Jul 18, 2011; substantive revision Wed Apr 17, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Tsongkhapa Losang Drakpa (1357&ndash;1419) is a well-known Tibetan
religious philosopher and one of the most influential and innovative
scholars and practitioners in the history of Tibetan Buddhism. He
added to the Tibetan Buddhist traditions more globally by setting a
paradigm to integrate theory and practice while maintaining focus on
ethics, monastic discipline, and the traditions of scholarship and
meditation within the esoteric Buddhist tradition. His main
contribution to Buddhist philosophy was to show how to develop a
robust realism about the conventional world, and how to make sense of
epistemology and the possibility of knowledge in the context of global
illusion. He does this through the vehicle of commentary, focusing on
how to make sense of the Madhyamaka doctrine of the two truths in a
way that vindicates Chandrak&#299;rti and does not fall into a
nihilism.</p>

<p>
The historical Tsongkhapa lived during the period immediately
following the final redaction of the Kangyur
(<em>bKa</em>&rsquo; &rsquo;<em>gyur;</em> Buddhist
canon into the Tibetan language). He proposed a distinctive Middle Way
(<em>Madhyamaka</em>; <em>dbu ma pa</em>) philosophy which
differentiated between Chandrak&#299;rti&rsquo;s (fl. ca. 600) correct
Consequentialist (<em>pr&#257;sa&#7749;gika</em>; <em>thal</em>
&rsquo;<em>gyur pa</em>) interpretation of the works of the
Indian philosopher N&#257;g&#257;rjuna (third-fourth century), and an
incorrect Autonomist (<em>sv&#257;tantrika</em>; <em>rang rgyud
pa</em>) interpretation by Bh&#257;viveka (also known as Bhavya and
Bh&#257;vaviveka, fl. ca. 550). He is strongly influenced by the
Indo-Tibetan Buddhist logico-epistemological tradition
(<em>pram&#257;&#7751;a</em>; <em>tshad ma</em>), founded by the
Indian epistemologists Dign&#257;ga and Dharmak&#299;rti (fifth to
seventh century). Tsongkhapa strikes a balance between knowledge and
praxis, what we might term orthodoxy and orthopraxy. He explains that
the emptiness of intrinsic existence
(<em>Svabh&#257;va&#347;&#363;nyat&#257;</em>; <em>rang bzhin gyis
stong pa nyid</em>) is the ultimate truth
(<em>param&#257;rtha-satya</em>), but that even this is only true
conventionally. At the same time he develops a hermeneutics to help
retain the authority of correct moral statements on both a covering
(<em>sa&#7747;v&#7771;ti</em>) or conventional
(<em>vyavah&#257;ra</em>) level. Tsongkhapa was a prolific author who
wrote over 300 works, which were collected into 18 volumes. His most
influential writing reconciles the philosophy of emptiness with the
imperative of praxis, as embodied in a universal altruistic principle
(<em>bodhicitta</em>). He reconciles antinomian tantric praxis with
ordinary moral life, and also develops a distinctive analysis of
dependent origination (<em>prat&#299;tya-samutp&#257;da</em>) to
support his assertion that entities represent both conventional and
ultimate truths. Upon his passing in 1419, Tsongkhapa gave his yellow
hat to Gyaltsab Dharma Rinchen (<em>rGyal tshab dar ma rin chen</em>)
as a symbolic gesture that the disciple had been chosen to succeed
him.</p>

<h2 id="TsonLife">1. Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s Life</h2>

<h3 id="Over">1.1 Overview</h3>

<p>
Biographical information about Tsongkhapa comes from clues hidden in
his own writing, and primarily from the hagiography written by his
student Kedrup Pelzangpo (<em>mKhas grub dpal bzang po</em>,
1385&ndash;1438) called <em>Stream of Faith</em> (<em>Dad
pa</em>&rsquo;<em>i</em> &rsquo;<em>jug ngog</em>)
(a partial translation can be found in Thurman
 1982).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s life can be roughly divided into an earlier and
later period. The later period is defined by a series of publications,
beginning in about 1400 CE, which systematically present his by this
point fully mature philosophy. Tsongkhapa, influenced by the divisions
used by the editors of the Kangyur, treats exoteric and esoteric
sources separately. His philosophical views on the esoteric school, of
tantra, and, to a certain extent his work on ethics fall naturally
into separate categories. The later period of his life includes a
period of institution building, work which eventually led to the
founding of a new school tradition.</p>

<p>
The most influential of Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s works include <em>The Great
Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment</em> (<em>Lam rim
chen mo</em>), completed in 1402; his masterpiece on Buddhist
hermeneutics the <em>Essence of Eloquence</em> (<em>Legs bshad snying
po</em>) authored in 1407; the <em>Ocean of Reasoning</em> (<em>Rigs
pa</em>&rsquo;<em>i rgya mtsho</em>), a commentary on
N&#257;g&#257;rjuna&rsquo;s <em>Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle</em>
composed in 1408; and his last important treatise, the
<em>Illuminating the Intent</em> (<em>Dgongs pa rab gsal</em>), a
commentary on Chandrak&#299;rti&rsquo;s <em>Entering the Middle
Way</em> (<em>Madhyamak&#257;vat&#257;ra</em>) completed in 1418, all
of which are fundamental to an understanding of his philosophy.</p>

<h3 id="DetaAcco">1.2 Detailed account</h3>

<p>
Tsongkhapa was born in the tenth month of the Fire Bird year of the
traditional Tibetan calendar, which corresponds to October 1357 CE, in
Tsongkha, the Land of Onions, from which he acquired his name.
Tsongkha was an ancient name for a part of what is now the Amdo region
of Greater Tibet (<em>Bod chen</em>), today included as part of
Qinghai Province of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China. Born to his
father Lumbum Ge and his wife, Shingsa Achoe, he was the fourth of six
children&mdash;one daughter and five sons. His given name was Losang
Drakpa (<em>bLo bzang grags pa</em>). He is also known by the
honorific title <em>Je Rinpoche</em> (<em>rJe rin po che</em>,
Precious Lord).</p>

<p>
Starting from his birth, the young Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s development was
followed closely by the learned Choje Dhondrup Rinchen (<em>Chos rje
don grub rin chen</em>) who came from the nearby Jakjyung Monastery
(<em>Bya khyung dgon</em>) to pay regular visits to the family as the
boy&rsquo;s primary instructor. With him, Tsongkhapa learned how to
recite the mantras of Ma&ntilde;ju&#347;r&#299; and the goddess
Sarasvat&#299;&mdash;meditation deities in the Tibetan Buddhist
tradition associated with knowledge and poetic eloquence. Soon after
Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s tutor Choje had formally taken custody of him, as
is the tradition with young Tibetan Buddhist acolytes, he received the
lay Buddhist precepts from the fourth Karmapa Karmapa Rolpai
Dorj&eacute; (1340&ndash;83), the head of the Tibetan Karma Kagyu
tradition. During this ceremony, which took place in 1360, the name
Kunga Nyingpo (<em>Kun dga</em>&rsquo; <em>snying po</em>) was also bestowed
upon him. At the age of six, the young Tsongkhapa moved into his
tutor&rsquo;s residence to begin his formal education, which would
include reading, writing, and memorizing the scriptures. Even before
his novice ordination of the same year, Tsongkhapa was thus introduced
to the esoteric traditions of Tibetan Buddhism. Upon receiving his
novice vows, he received the name Lobsang Drakpa (<em>Blo bzang grags
pa</em>), which he would use throughout the rest of his life.</p>

<p>
By age sixteen, Tsongkhapa had mastered much of what his tutor Choje
had to transmit to him, which led him to further his studies by
memorizing the most important texts passed on from the great Indian
monastic centres of N&#257;land&#257;, Vikramala&#347;&#299;la, and
Jagaddala. He also showed a natural aptitude for being able to retain
the <em>mantras</em> and <em>s&#257;dhanas</em>, as well as the
meditative practices connected to the esoteric teaching corpus. In his
teens (1372&ndash;73), Tsongkhapa undertook the thirteen hundred mile
journey from Tsong kha to Central (<em>dBus</em>) Tibet
(<em>Bod</em>), where he remained until his death in 1419. He arrived
in the fall of 1373 as a young man at the famous monastery of Drikung
Thil (&rsquo;<em>Bri gung mthil</em>) (Jinpa 2019).</p>

<p>
Central Tibet at this time was nearing the end of a long and fruitful
period of intellectual activity known as the Later Diffusion [of
Buddhism] (<em>spyi dar</em>), which began with the works of
translator Rin chen bzang po (958&ndash;1055) and the scholar-saint
D&#299;pa&#7747;k&#257;ra-&#347;r&#299;j&ntilde;&#257;na Ati&#347;a
(980&ndash;1054), and ended with the most important editor of the
Kangyur, But&ouml;n (<em>Bu ston rin chen grub</em>, 1290&ndash;1364).
According to Kedrup, Tsongkhapa first studied Tibetan medicine here,
then a traditional Buddhist curriculum of abhidharma, tenet systems
(<em>Grub mtha</em>&rsquo;) focusing on the Middle Way and Mind Only
(<em>Cittam&#257;tra</em>, also called <em>yog&#257;c&#257;ra</em>)
philosophy, Buddhist ethics (<em>sdom gsum</em>), and epistemology
(<em>pram&#257;&#7751;a</em>). His early studies were pursued mainly
in institutions affiliated with the two dominant scholarly traditions
(<em>lugs</em>) of the time: the Sangphu (<em>gSang phu ne</em>
&rsquo;<em>u tog</em>) tradition founded by Ngok Lotsawa Loden Sherab
(<em>rNgog bLo ldan shes rab</em>, 1059&ndash;1109), and the Sakya
(<em>Sa skya</em>) epistemological tradition based primarily on the
works of the Sa skya pa&#7751;&#7693;i ta (1182&ndash;1251). He also
studied and practiced tantric Buddhism.</p>

<p>
Shortly after his arrival to Central Tibet, Tsongkhapa rerouted to one
of the most important centres of learning in the region, the Dewachen
Monastery (<em>bDe ba can dgon pa</em>) in Nyethang (<em>mNyes
thang</em>). Nyethang was known to be one of the six major learning
centers at that time, the others being Sangphu (<em>gSang phu</em>),
Kyormolung (<em>sKyor mo lung</em>), Gadong
(<em>dGa</em>&rsquo;<em> gdong dgon</em>), Zulphu (<em>Zul
phu</em>), and Tsal Gungthang Monasteries (<em>Tshal gung thang</em>)
(Jinpa 2019). After two years of study at Nyethang, in 1375, at the
age of nineteen, Tsongkhapa sat for his first formal philosophical
debate. From then, he continued to move around Central Tibet, rotating
his visits across these sites.</p>

<p>
At Shalu Monastery (<em>Zha lu dgon</em>), he met with Rinchen Namgyal
(<em>Rin chen rnam rgyal</em>, 1318&ndash;88), the foremost student of
But&ouml;n (<em>Bu ston</em>) and his successor at Shalu. Tsongkhapa
took the opportunity to receive important tantric transmissions
connected with the meditation deity Cakrasa&#7747;vara from this
renowned master. His next stop was the great and important monastery
of Sakya (<em>Sa skya dgon</em>), situated to the west of the town of
Shigatse (<em>gZhis ka rtse</em>) and famous for having taught Sakya
Pa&#7751;&#7693;itaIn Sakya, Tsongkhapa met his future principal
master, Rendawa Shonu Lodro (<em>Red mda&rsquo; ba gzhon nu blo
gros</em>, 1349&ndash;1412) (Jinpa 2019). From Sakya Monastery,
Tsongkhapa traveled on to Jonang, the residence of the renowned master
Dolpopa Shreab Gyaltsen (<em>Dol po pa shes rab rgyal mtshan</em>,
1292&ndash;1361), where he received initial instructions on the
K&#257;lacakra tantra. The next station after Jonang was Bodong E
monastery (<em>Bo dong e dgon</em>), another important center of
learning, where he sat for formal debate before moving onto Narthang
Monastery (<em>sNar thang dgon</em>), after having spent some time at
the monastery at Sangpu, one of the most important centers of
philosophical learning associated with Ati&#347;a&rsquo;s Kadam
(<em>bKa</em>&rsquo; <em>gdams</em>) school. He was very eager to study the
Vasubandu (fourth to fifth century CE) Abidharma. Upon hearing that
the Indian commentaries were being taught by the masters from the
monastery at Nyawon (<em>Nya dbon dgon</em>), Tsongkhapa headed there
next. The lead teacher at Nyawon, Master Nyawon himself, referred him
to Rendawa, a visiting teacher at the monastery, who was an expert on
the Indian commentaries and also the Abhidharma material. Rendawa
would become one of the most influential teachers of the period, and
would later also become a colleague of Tsongkhapa. Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s
formal study of monastic discipline was conducted at Kyormolung
Monastery (<em>sKyor mo lung dgon</em>). In 1377, at age twenty,
Tsongkhapa started to teach formally. His first classes were on
Asa&#7749;ga&rsquo;s <em>Compendium of Abhidharma</em>
(<em>Abhidharmasamuccaya</em>), a text he had studied with his teacher
Rendawa only a year earlier.</p>

<p>
As can be seen from the above biography, it would be one of
Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s defining traits to alternate between intellectual
and contemplative phases, as he had done during his training period.
Thus, in 1378, Tsongkhapa entered a strictly solitary cloistered
retreat. In the spring of 1379, at age twenty-two, Tsongkhapa emerged
from his period of seclusion to prepare for his formal debates on the
remaining disciplines he was yet to be examined on: logic and
epistemology, <em>Abhidharma</em>, and <em>Vinaya</em>. After having
successfully passed these philosophical debates at Narthang Monastery
in 1380, he was from then on considered a master of the four primary
disciplines of Buddhist scholarship, thus enabling Tsongkhapa to
formally begin accepting his own students.</p>

<p>
During the period of Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s training, the study of the
Madhyamaka, mainly N&#257;g&#257;rjuna&rsquo;s <em>Fundamental Wisdom
of the Middle Way</em> (<em>M&#363;lamadhyamakak&#257;rik&#257;</em>)
and Chandrak&#299;rti&rsquo;s <em>Entering the Middle Way</em>
<em>Madhyamaka&#772;vata&#772;ra</em>) did not form part of the formal
curriculum. To further his study of Madhyamaka, Tsongkhapa deepened
his studies under Rendawa&rsquo;s careful tutelage, leading to his
final formal debate which took place at Tsethang Monastery (<em>rTsed
thang dgon</em>), the place where Tsongkhapa also received the
complete ordination vows as a now fully ordained monk.</p>

<p>
In his early years after this formative period of seclusion, he wrote
a number of essays on topics surrounding Abhidharma (Apple 2008), a
detailed investigation of the <em>&#257;laya-vij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>
(The Foundation, Storehouse, Basis-of all Consciousness) (Sparham
1993), and an important treatise, <em>Golden Garland of Eloquence</em>
(<em>Legs bshad gser phreng</em>), on the Perfection of Wisdom
(<em>praj&ntilde;&#257;-p&#257;ramit&#257;</em>) literature based on
the codification of its topics in the <em>Ornament for the Clear
Realizations</em> (<em>Abhisamay&#257;la&#7747;k&#257;ra</em>) in two
volumes (Sparham 2007&ndash;2013). He concluded this first publication
at the age of thirty-one.</p>

<p>
After completing his <em>Golden Garland of Eloquence</em> in
1388&ndash;89, Tsongkhapa spent a period of some ten years removed
from the hub of intellectual activity. And yet, when looking at his
later literary production, it is clear that Tsongkhapa must have spent
an extensive period of time with the most important Indian Buddhist
texts which formed part of the Tibetan Buddhist canon, all of which
helped him to develop his unique critical understanding of the key
Indian Buddhist source texts. He further engaged in meditation and
ritual religious exercises in Southern Tibet (<em>Lho kha</em>) where,
as evidenced in his short autobiographical writing from this
transitional period (Thurman 1982), and corroborated by traditional
sources (Kaschewsky 1971; Vostrikov 1970), he reports that he entered
into a communion or dialogue with
<em>Ma&ntilde;ju&#347;r&#299;</em>&mdash;the iconographic
representation of perfect knowledge in the Buddhist pantheon. Through
the voice of <em>Ma&ntilde;ju&#347;r&#299;</em> he articulated a
hierarchical system of philosophies, culminating in what he
characterized as a pristine, Middle Way,
<em>Pr&#257;sa&#7749;gika-madhyamaka</em> (<em>dBu ma thal</em>
&rsquo;<em>gyur pa</em>) that avoided both over-reification (of the
absolute) and over-negation (of the conventional).</p>

<p>
Tsongkhapa framed his insights not as original contributions, but as a
rediscovery of meanings already revealed by the Buddha. In all his
works he characterizes his philosophy as being identical to the
Buddha&rsquo;s. Further, he says that his philosophy is based on
N&#257;g&#257;rjuna&rsquo;s and N&#257;g&#257;rjuna&rsquo;s follower
&#256;ryadeva&rsquo;s (third-fourth century) explanation of what the
Buddha said. His philosophy gets its name
<em>Pr&#257;sa&#7749;gika</em> (&ldquo;those who reveal the unwelcome
consequences [inherent in other&rsquo;s assertions]&rdquo;) from the
importance it gives to Buddhap&#257;lita&rsquo;s (late fifth century)
explication of N&#257;g&#257;rjuna&rsquo;s work, and to
Chandrak&#299;rti&rsquo;s defense of Buddhap&#257;lita&rsquo;s
explanation, in the face of criticism by Bh&#257;viveka.</p>

<p>
Tsongkhapa presented his mature philosophy in a series of volumes
during the later period of his life, beginning with the publication of
his most famous work, <em>The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path
to Enlightenment</em> in 1402, at the age of forty-six. This was
followed by <em>Essence of Eloquence</em> (<em>Legs bshad snying
po</em>) and <em>Ocean of Reasoning</em> (<em>Rigs pa&rsquo;i rgya
mtsho</em>) (1407&ndash;1408), the <em>Middle-Length Treatise on the
Stages of the Path to Enlightenment</em> (<em>Lam rim</em>
&rsquo;<em>bring</em>) in 1415, and, in the last years of his
life, his <em>Illuminating the Intent</em> (Jinpa 2021).</p>

<p>
Together, in this series of works written over a seventeen year
period, he succeeded in setting the agenda for the following
centuries, with later writers taking positions both for and against
his arguments. As is so often the case, his stature pushed much of
earlier Tibetan intellectual history into the shadows, until its
rediscovery by the Eclectic Movement (<em>Ris med</em>) in Derge
(<em>sDe dge</em>) in the late eighteenth century.</p>

<p>
Tsongkhapa wrote his major works on tantra and ethics at the same time
as his major philosophical works. His <em>Collected Works</em>
(<em>gsungs</em> &rsquo;<em>bum</em>), contained in 18 or 19
volumes, deal with topics based on tantric sources in volumes
3&ndash;12. In 1405 he completed his <em>Great Exposition of
Tantra</em> (<em>sNgags rim chen mo</em>) (Hopkins 2016; Yarnall 2013)
a companion volume to his <em>Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path
to Enlightenment</em>, where, in harmony with his philosophy, he
argued that tantra is defined neither by special insight
(<em>vipa&#347;yana</em>) nor Mah&#257;y&#257;na universal altruism,
but solely by deity yoga (<em>lha</em>&rsquo;<em>i rnal</em>
&rsquo;<em>byor</em>) (Hopkins 2016).</p>

<p>
In 1402, Tsongkhapa, with his teacher Rendawa (Roloff 2009) and
others, convened a gathering of monks at the temple of Namstedeng
(<em>rNam rtsed ldeng/lding</em>) with the intention of reinvigorating
the Buddhist order. From this came Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s short but
influential works on basic Buddhist morality
(<em>pr&#257;timok&#7779;a</em>) that in turn laid the foundation for
the importance some Gelukpa monasteries would place on a stricter
adherence to the monastic code. In 1403 his influential works on
ethical codes for bodhisattvas (<em>Byang chub gzhung lam</em>) (Tatz
1986) and for tantric practitioners (<em>rtsa ltung rnam bshad</em>)
(Sparham 2005) appeared. His separate explanations of the three
ethical codes (<em>sdom gsum</em>) are distinguished by the centrality
they give to basic morality, the importance the bodhisattva&rsquo;s
code retains in tantra, and in the antinomian tantras, the presence of
a separate pr&#257;timok&#7779;a-like ordination ritual built around a
codification of ethical conduct specific to tantric practitioners.</p>

<p>
By 1409, at the age of fifty-two, his place in Tibetan society was
sufficiently established that he could garner the support and
sponsorship necessary for a successful rejuvenation of the central
temple in Lhasa, for the establishment of a new-year prayer festival
(<em>smon lam chen mo</em>), and for the completion of a large new
monastery, Ganden (<em>dGa</em>&rsquo; <em>ldan</em>), where he lived for much
of the rest of his life, until his death there in 1419. He inspired
two of his students, Tashi Palden (<em>bKra shis dpal ldan</em>,
1379&ndash;1449) and Shakya Yeshe (<em>ShAkya ye shes</em>,
1354&ndash;1435), to found Drepung (&rsquo;<em>Bras spungs</em>)
Monastery in 1416, and Sera Monastery in 1419, respectively. These,
with Ganden, would later become the three largest and most powerful
Gelukpa monasteries, and indeed, the biggest monasteries in the world.
In 1407 and 1413 the Ming dynasty Yongle Emperor recognized
Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s growing fame and importance by inviting him to the
Chinese court, as was the custom.</p>

<h2 id="EarlPeri">2. Early Period</h2>

<h3 id="ExplDiffPoinKunGzhiDkaGrel">2.1 <em>Explanation of the Difficult Points</em> (<em>Kun gzhi dka</em>&rsquo; &rsquo;<em>grel</em>)</h3>

<p>
Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s most important works from his early period are his
<em>Explanation of the Difficult Points</em> (<em>Kun gzhi
dka</em>&rsquo; &rsquo;<em>grel</em>) and <em>Golden Garland of
Eloquence</em>.</p>

<p>
In the former he gives a detailed explanation of the
<em>&#257;laya-vij&ntilde;&#257;na</em> (foundation
consciousness)&mdash;according to Tsongkhapa the distinctive eighth
consciousness in the eight-consciousness system of
Asa&#7749;ga&rsquo;s (fourth century) Indian Yog&#257;c&#257;ra
Buddhism.</p>

<p>
Tsongkhapa opens his work with a brief discussion of the relationship
between the views of N&#257;g&#257;rjuna and Asa&#7749;ga. Tsongkhapa
then reveals in the different usages of the term
<em>&#257;laya-vij&ntilde;&#257;na</em> and its near synonyms a
negative connotation conveying the cause and effect nature of repeated
suffering existences (<em>sa&#7747;s&#257;ra</em>). He surveys the
relevant literature, limiting his discussion of <em>gotra</em>
(lineage, in the sense of the innate ability a person has to grow up
into a fully enlightened being) to the presentation given in
Asa&#7749;ga&rsquo;s Bodhisattva Levels
(<em>Bodhisattva-bh&#363;mi</em>). There the &ldquo;residual
impression left by listening [to the correct exposition of the
truth]&rdquo; (<em>&#347;ruta-v&#257;san&#257;</em>) is the seed
(<em>b&#299;ja</em>) that matures into enlightenment. It is little
more than the innate clarity of mind when it is freed from
limitation-by-habituation to a correct vision of reality.</p>

<p>
Tsongkhapa limits the sources for his explanation to non-tantric
works, almost all by persons he will later describe as Indian
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra writers, thereby demonstrating the influence the
categories used in the recently redacted Kangyur and Tengyur
(<em>bsTan</em> &rsquo;<em>gyur</em>, the name for the
commentaries in Tibetan translation included in the canon) had on his
thinking.</p>

<p>
When Tsongkhapa arrived in Central Tibet, the pressing philosophical
issue of the day was Dolpopa&rsquo;s Great Middle Way
(<em>Mah&#257;-madhayamaka</em>; <em>dbu ma chen po</em>) philosophy.
Dolpopa propounded a hermeneutics based on the principle that a Buddha
will always state clearly what he means. Based on a wide array of
sources, and without making a clear distinction between tantric and
non-tantric works, the central tenet of the Great Middle Way is that
an absolute, pure, transcendental mind endowed with all good
equalities exists, one which is radically other than the ordinary
world of appearance. It is the archetypical Tibetan Buddhist <em>gzhan
stong</em> (pronounced shentong, emptiness of other) philosophy.</p>

<p>
Dolpopa, stressing the hermeneutic stated above, says
N&#257;g&#257;rjuna and Asa&#7749;ga, who wrote their treatises during
the golden age, share the same philosophy, the Great Middle Way which
was clearly articulated by the Buddha. Dolpopa distinguishes a pure,
transcendental knowledge (<em>kun gzhi ye shes</em>) that is quite
other than the defiled foundation consciousness (<em>kun gzhi rnam
shes</em>), and equates the former with his single absolute, endowed
with all the qualities of a Buddha.</p>

<p>
Later, in his mature period, as explained below, Tsongkhapa will be
explicit, stating categorically that Asa&#7749;ga&rsquo;s
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra Buddhism is distinct from, and less definitive
than, N&#257;g&#257;rjuna&rsquo;s Middle Way school (D. Wangchuk
2013), going so far as to remove all references to a Great Middle Way
school from his work. He will state that the
<em>&#257;laya-vij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>, that which is devoid of
subject-object bifurcation, provides the essential mind-stuff for
defilement (<em>sa&#7747;s&#257;ra</em>) and carries seeds for
purification (<em>nirv&#257;&#7751;a</em>) in a Yog&#257;c&#257;ra
system that is fundamentally wrong, and at odds with the way things
actually are. He will give the <em>&#257;laya-vij&ntilde;&#257;na</em>
only a heuristic value, and insist that a correct view (the
Pr&#257;sa&#7749;gika-madhyamaka view) of the workings of
psycho-physical reality (the Buddhist skandhas) totally invalidates
it. As Jeffrey Hopkins (2002, 2006) has shown, such statements
constitute an explicit rejection of Dolpopa&rsquo;s view, a position
Tsongkhapa is still in the process of formulating in earlier works
such as the <em>Explanation of the Difficult Points</em>.</p>

<p>
In his <em>Explanation of the Difficult Points</em>, Tsongkhapa does
not accept the view of Dolpopa, but does not say what exactly he will
put in its place. He ignores Dolpopa&rsquo;s pure, transcendental
knowledge called <em>&#257;laya</em>, mentioning it obliquely, only in
passing, during a final brief survey of views based on Chinese
sources; he leaves unanswered the question of the final ontological
status of the eighth consciousness, but appears to accept it as having
a provisional reality; and he allows the views of Asa&#7749;ga set
forth in the <em>Bodhisattva-bh&#363;mi</em> to retain an authority at
this stage, an authority he will later explicitly deny.</p>

<h3 id="GoldGarlEloqLegsBshaGserPhre">2.2 <em>Golden Garland of Eloquence</em> (<em>Legs bshad gser phreng</em>)</h3>

<p>
Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s <em>Golden Garland of Eloquence</em> is his most
important early work. It takes the form of a long explanation of the
Perfection of Wisdom s&#363;tras, given pride of place in the Kangyur
as the foremost words of the Buddha, after the Vinaya section (the
codifications of ethical conduct). It systematically reviews the
twenty-one Indian commentaries on the root text, highlighting their
correspondences as well as their differences. It is a meticulous
commentary on the topics in the <em>Ornament for the Clear
Realizations</em>, as well as on the commentaries by sixth-century
scholar &#256;rya Vimuktisena and eighth-century scholar Acharya
Haribhadra&rsquo;s short but influential commentary <em>The Clear
Meaning</em> (<em>Abhisamay&#257;la&#7747;k&#257;raviv&#7771;ti</em>).
Maitreya&rsquo;s work is a verse summary of the extensive
<em>Perfection of Wisdom</em> s&#363;tras which focuses on both the
medium-length and concise versions of the <em>Perfection of
Wisdom</em> s&#363;tras, namely the s&#363;tras in Twenty-Five
Thousand Lines and Eight Thousand Lines. The root text was initially
translated into Tibetan by Ngok Lotsawa Loden Sherab in the eleventh
century, supplementing his translation with his topical outline and
his own commentary.</p>

<p>
Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s exegesis represents a novel approach to Tibetan
hermeneutics for several reasons. First, it disentangles for the
reader the complex and multi-layered relationship between
Maitreya&rsquo;s root text, based on the <em>Perfection of Wisdom</em>
s&#363;tras, and its later commentaries. It cites almost exclusively
Indian sources and does not refer to Tibetan thinkers as source
authorities. According to Thupten Jinpa (2019), the work demonstrates
a surprising methodological approach, which blends approaches based in
textual critiques, philological analysis, well-placed
contextualizations, as well as conscientious inclusions of the
work&rsquo;s commentators&rsquo; individual philosophical positions.
It sets the groundwork for a philosophy that the philosophical
scholars in the Geluk tradition will follow, which is further
developed in the mature works of Tsongkhapa, a taxonomy known as the
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra-Sv&#257;tantrika-Madhyamaka, in essence, a Middle
Way that incorporates many of the categories of Yog&#257;c&#257;ra
Buddhism, but which lacks the authority of Chandrak&#299;rti&rsquo;s
Pr&#257;sa&#7749;gika interpretation.</p>

<p>
A great deal has been written on the difference between
Pr&#257;sa&#7749;gika and Sv&#257;tantrika (see Dreyfus &amp;
McClintock 2003). Historically, the Gelukpa&rsquo;s
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra-sv&#257;tantrika-madhyamaka is another name for the
mainstream philosophical school that developed in Tibet, based
primarily on the teaching of &#346;&#257;ntarak&#7779;ita and his
student Kamala&#347;&#299;la (both fl. end of the eighth century), the
most influential of all the Indian pa&#7751;&#7693;itas involved in
the dissemination of Buddhist ideas to Tibet. Later Gelukpa
scholastics, based on the mature works of Tsongkhapa, deny that
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra-sv&#257;tantrika-madhyamaka represents the most
sophisticated Buddhist view. At the same time, they acknowledge its
centrality to the development of Buddhist thought in Tibet.</p>

<p>
In the <em>Golden Garland of Eloquence</em>, Tsongkhapa, following
&#346;&#257;ntarak&#7779;ita&rsquo;s school as it developed in Tibet,
asserts that all bases (<em>vastu</em>) (the psycho-physical factors
locating the person as they begin their philosophical career), all
mental states along the course of the path (<em>m&#257;rga</em>), and
the final result, are illusory, because they lack any essential
nature. In this work, however, it is not yet clear how the basis
relates to the final outcome (the result). As explained below,
Tsongkhapa will solve the problem in his mature works by taking the
clear, radical, nihilistic leap of denying any essential nature
whatsoever, anywhere, to anything, thereby implicitly and explicitly
devaluing (in absolutist terms) the ontological status of the final,
pure, unified state, relegating it to just one more conventional,
dependently-originated thing.</p>

<p>
In the <em>Golden Garland of Eloquence</em>, Tsongkhapa has not yet
fully developed his mature, systematic philosophy. He uses
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra terminology. The primary object of philosophical
inquiry in the Golden Garland is the unity of the perceiving
subject-in-enlightenment, a topic that reflects the language and
concerns of the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra-sv&#257;tantrika-Madhyamaka
school.</p>

<p>
Tsongkhapa in this early work is still comfortable with characterizing
the ultimate as an absence of elaboration
(<em>ni&#7779;prapa&ntilde;ca</em>; <em>spros bral</em>) beyond the
four extremes, later set forth as the orthodox view of the Sakya
tradition. Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s rejection of this characterization in
his later work gives rise to sustained critique of his views by
writers like Gorampa Sonam Senge (<em>Go rams pa bsod nams
sge ge</em>, 1429&ndash;1489) (Cabezon &amp; Dargyay 2007; Yakherds
2021).</p>

<p>
The <em>Golden Garland of Eloquence of Eloquence</em> is driven in no
small measure by an agenda dedicated to discrediting Dolpopa&rsquo;s
Perfection of Wisdom commentaries. This is evident from a comparison
of Dolpopa and Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s sources and views. While Dolpopa
excoriates &#256;rya Vimuktisena and Acharya Haribhadra and says they
belong to the degenerate age, propounding doctrines harmful to Golden
Age Buddhism, the <em>Golden Garland of Eloquence</em> privileges the
commentaries by &#256;rya Vimuktisena and Acharya Haribhadra. Dolpopa
says the <em>Detailed Explanations of the Perfection of Wisdom
S&#363;tras</em>
(<em>B&#7771;ha&#7789;&#7789;&#299;k&#257;</em>; <em>Yum gsum gnod</em>
&rsquo;<em>joms</em>) by &ldquo;the foremost, Great Middle Way master
Vasubandhu&rdquo; stand as the primary scriptural authority for the
Great Middle Way doctrine, superior even to the partial truths
revealed by N&#257;g&#257;rjuna. The <em>Golden Garland of
Eloquence</em> disputes that Vasubandhu is the author of the two
Detailed Explanations, and says, regardless of their author, they are
simply restatements of N&#257;g&#257;rjuna&rsquo;s Middle Way.
Finally, Dolpopa propounds a doctrine which holds that the basis,
path, and result are eternally the same, and all else is thoroughly
imaginary, whereas the <em>Golden Garland of Eloquence</em> is certain
that such a view is wrong, and directly cites a passage from
Dolpopa&rsquo;s work, albeit without naming its author, saying,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
since no other great path-breaker, [i.e., founder of an original
philosophy] besides him has ever asserted [what Dolpopa says], learned
persons are right to cast out [what he says] like a gob of spit.
(Sparham 2007&ndash;2013: vol. 1, 425)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="MatuPeri">3. Mature Period</h2>

<p>
After completing the <em>Golden Garland</em>, Tsongkhapa formulated
the philosophy for which he is best known, and further intensified his
focus to include the study, contemplation, and eventual mastery of the
esoteric Vajray&#257;na teachings. His aim from then on was the
apprehension and development of a more systematic approach to the
esoteric corpus. His mature period was also marked by touring the most
important scholastic centers of the time, exchanging ideas with his
learned contemporaries, as well as spending prolonged periods in
meditation. Tsongkhapa also commenced his teaching career during this
period. At Monkhar Tashi Dong Monastery (<em>Mon mkhar bkra shis ldong
dgon</em>), for instance, he was asked by the monks of both Monkhar
Tashi Dong and its surrounding monasteries to give an extensive
teaching program, for which he taught 17 texts, focusing mainly on
Indian authors. During the following summer of 1389, at the age of
thirty-three Tsongkhapa spent time in solitary retreat in the Yarlung
Valley (<em>Yar klung</em>). He focused on the Cakrasa&#7747;vara
tantra by respecting a disciplined schedule of four meditation
sessions per day, and would supplement these by performing the
self-empowerment rites of the tantra. He also meditated on the six
yogas of Niguma (<em>Ni gu ma</em>), an essential instruction to the
Shangpa Kagyu (<em>Shangs pa bka</em>&rsquo;<em> brgyud</em>)
tradition stemming from teachings by the Indian yogini Niguma . He
would continue to repeat those tantric retreat sessions at regular
intervals throughout his life. During these years he also sought out
mystics, tantric teachers, and hermits to converse with. One such
encounter, which took place some time around 1390&ndash;91, was with
the mystic Umapa Tsondrue Senge (<em>dBu ma pa brtson</em>
&rsquo;<em>grus seng ge</em>). It was also during this period
that Tsongkhapa began to formulate his theory on the relationship
between knowledge and meditation. His method for incorporating the
Buddhist view into daily practice was threefold, involving listening
and studying, contemplating and critical reflection, and meditation
(<em>thos bsam sgom gsum</em>). Tsongkhapa also began to look into the
extant discursive literature on the meaning of meditation. He was
therefore able to distinguish, following the Indian Buddhist masters,
two kinds of meditation: analytic or discursive meditation (<em>dpyad
sgom</em>) and resting or placement meditation (&rsquo;<em>jug
sgom</em>).</p>

<p>
Central to Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s insights is his insistence on the
emptiness at the heart of all relationships and the doctrine of
dependent origination. For him, the first question we must ask to
understand the Madhyamaka view of emptiness is whether we can
reconcile the apparent consistency we observe in our everyday
experiences, particularly the predictability of cause and effect, with
the intellectual understanding that nothing possesses any inherent
objective existence, not even at the smallest scale.</p>

<p>
Reflecting on his insight, Tsongkhapa would write in his <em>In Praise
of Dependent Origination</em> (<em>brTen</em> &rsquo;<em>brel
bstod pa</em>) (translation by Jinpa, undated)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Nonetheless, before the stream of this life
<br />
Flowing towards death has come to cease
<br />
That I have found slight faith in you&mdash;
<br />
Even this I think is fortunate.
<br />
Among teachers, the teacher of dependent origination,
<br />
Amongst wisdoms, the knowledge of dependent origination&mdash;
<br />
You, who&rsquo;re most excellent like the kings in the worlds,
<br />
Know this perfectly well, not others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Tsongkhapa first sets forth this mature philosophy linking dependent
origination and emptiness in a special section at the end of his
<em>Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment</em>.
There, in the context of an investigation into the effect of an
authentic, intellectual investigation into the truly real
(<em>Tattva</em>; <em>de kho na</em>), and into the way things finally
are at their deepest level (<em>Tathat&#257;</em>; <em>de bzhin
 nyid</em>),<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 he says that we can only identify the object of negation (<em>dgag
bya</em>), i.e., the last false projection to appear as reality, by
avoiding two errors: going too far (<em>khyab che ba</em>) and not
going far enough (<em>khyab chung ba</em>) (Garfield &amp;
Thakch&ouml;e 2011).</p>

<p>
This section of Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s work is based on the opening verse
of N&#257;g&#257;rjuna&rsquo;s <em>Root Verses on the Middle Way</em>
(<em>M&#363;la-madhyamaka-k&#257;rik&#257;</em>). Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s
<em>Ocean of Reasoning</em> (Ngawang Samten &amp; Garfield 2006) is a
detailed exegesis of this work. According to Tsongkhapa,
N&#257;g&#257;rjuna&rsquo;s statement is about a first moment in the
continuum of the investigating person. Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s choice of
the opening line&rsquo;s of N&#257;g&#257;rjuna&rsquo;s work as a
point of departure for his philosophy stems from his belief that he
has gained a true insight into dependent origination
(<em>prat&#299;tya-samutp&#257;da</em>). This insight, he believes,
resolves the paradox between his apparent nihilism and his insistence
on the weight of authoritative statements and cognitions. Thus he says
in his <em>Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to
Enlightenment</em>,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Therefore, the intelligent should develop an unshakeable certainty
that the very meaning of emptiness is dependent-arising&hellip;
Specifically, this is the subtle point that the noble
N&#257;g&#257;rjuna and his spiritual son &#256;ryadeva had in mind
and upon which the master Buddhap&#257;lita and the glorious
Chandrak&#299;rti gave fully comprehensive commentary. This is how
dependent-arising bestows certain knowledge of the absence of
intrinsic existence; this is how it dawns on you that it is things
which are devoid of intrinsic existence that are causes and effects.
(Lamrim Chenmo Translation Committee 2000&ndash;2004: vol. 3, 139)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Tsongkhapa set out the ramifications of his view in &ldquo;eight
points that are difficult to understand&rdquo; (<em>dka</em>&rsquo; <em>gnas
brgyad</em>), first enumerated in notes (<em>rjes byang</em>) to one
of his lectures by his contemporary and disciple, Gyaltsab Dharma
Rinchen (then also called Gyaltsab Jey (<em>rGyal tshab rje)</em>, the
regent). Tillemans (1998) has elegantly translated the opening of the
text as follows,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Concerning the [ontological] bases, there are the following [three
points]: (1) the conventional nonacceptance of particulars and of (2)
the storehouse consciousness, and (3) the acceptance of external
objects. Concerning the path, there are the following [four points]:
(4) the nonacceptance of autonomous reasonings as being means for
understanding reality and (5) the nonacceptance of self-awareness; (6)
the way in which the two obscurations exist; (7) how it is accepted
that the Buddha&rsquo;s disciples and those who become awakened
without a Buddha&rsquo;s help realize that things are without any
own-nature. Concerning the result, there is: (8) the way in which the
buddhas know [conventional] things in their full extent. Thus, there
are four accepted theses and four unaccepted theses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These theses have in turn been discussed by a number of writers (Ruegg
2002; Cabezon 1992: 397; Cabezon &amp; Dargyay 2007: 76&ndash;93,
114&ndash;201).</p>

<p>
In <em>Essence of Eloquence</em>, Tsongkhapa argues that no datum that
appears to (or is there but remains unknown to) thought or sense
perception, has any essential reality. All are, equally, simply
labeled by thought construction (<em>rtog pas btags tsam</em>). Only
convention makes the actual sense-faculties, for example, real, and
success or failure experienced in a dream, for example, false. This
dependent origination (between a label and what is labeled) precludes
the essential existence implicit in the Epistemologist&rsquo;s
sva-lak&#7779;a&#7751;a.</p>

<p>
Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s rejection of Yog&#257;c&#257;ra idealism leads him
to assert the existence of external objects (the third point). His
(discredited) Yog&#257;c&#257;ra school, based on either the works of
Asa&#7749;ga or the Epistemologists, explains the absence of
subject-object bifurcation as non-dual with thought or mind
(<em>citta</em>). Realizing this in a non-conceptual, meditational
state constitutes a liberating vision. Ultimately, therefore, external
objects are projections of a deluded mind. Tsongkhapa rejects this,
though he suggests only those who have understood the emptiness of
inherent existence through reflecting on the natural workings of
dependent origination can set it aside. As he says in <em>Ocean of
Reasoning</em>,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The meaning of the statement that the conventional designation of
subject and objects stops is that the designation of these two stops
from the perspective of meditative equipoise, but it does not mean
that the insight in meditative equipoise and the ultimate truth are
rejected as subject and object. This is because their being subject
and object is not posited from the perspective of analytic insight,
but from the perspective of conventional understanding. (trans.
Ngawang Samten &amp; Garfield 2006: 26)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
From the perspective of ordinary convention there are external
objects, so it is sufficient, on that level, to assert that they are
there.</p>

<p>
Tsongkhapa does not accept sv&#257;tantra (autonomous) reasoning (the
fourth point). He asserts that it is enough, when proving that any
given subject is empty of intrinsic existence, to lead the
interlocutor, through reasoning, to the unwelcome consequences
(<em>prasa&#7749;ga</em>) in their own untenable position; it is not
necessary to demonstrate the thesis based on reasoning that
presupposes any sort of intrinsic (autonomous) existence. This gives
Chandrak&#299;rti&rsquo;s school, with which Tsongkhapa identifies,
its name, <em>Pr&#257;sa&#7749;gika-madhyamaka</em>, i.e., a
philosophy of a middle way (between nihilism and eternalism) arrived
at through demonstrating the unwelcome consequences (in any given
position that presupposes intrinsic existence).</p>

<p>
In the context of this assertion, Tsongkhapa offers a distinctive
explanation of the well-known Nay&#257;yika objection to
N&#257;g&#257;rjuna&rsquo;s philosophy, namely, if the statements he
uses to prove his thesis are themselves without any final intrinsic
reality, they will be ineffective as proofs. Tsongkhapa says
Pr&#257;sa&#7749;gika-madhyamakas do not simply find faults in all
positions and reject all positions as their own. They only deny any
thesis that presupposes an intrinsic existence. They do hold a
specific thesis, to wit, that all phenomena lack an intrinsic
existence. They use reasoning and logic that lacks any essential
reality to establish this thesis. Such reasoning derives its
efficacity on a conventional level through the natural workings of
dependent origination. This is one of the most contentious assertions
of Tsongkhapa.</p>

<p>
Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s rejection of any form of self-referential
consciousness (<em>sva-sa&#7747;vitti, sva-sa&#7747;vedana</em>) (the
fifth point) is in essence a rejection of
&#346;&#257;ntarak&#7779;ita&rsquo;s position, that such
self-referential or reflexive awareness is necessary to explain the
self-evidential nature of consciousness, and to explain the privileged
access the conscious person has to their own consciousness as
immediate and veridical (Garfield
 2006).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 At issue is the status of the knowing subject engaged in the
intellectual pursuit of the truly real. Tsongkhapa holds that such a
knowing subject has no essential reality at all.</p>

<p>
Such a position requires of Tsongkhapa an explanation of memory. His
solution is to deny that when we remember seeing object X we also
remember the conscious act of seeing it. (Were we to do so, there
would have to be an aspect of the earlier consciousness of the object
that was equally conscious of itself, i.e., self-referential.)
Instead, Tsongkhapa argues, memory is simply the consciousness that
earlier we saw an object and that we now regard that experience to
have been in the past.</p>

<p>
Tsongkhapa characterizes basic ignorance (<em>avidy&#257;</em>), the
root cause of suffering in Buddhist philosophy, not as a latent
tendency, but as an active defiling agency
(<em>kle&#347;&#257;vara&#7751;a</em>) that projects a reality onto
objects that they do not in fact have. This ignorance affects even
sense perception and explains the veridical aspect that is, in fact,
just error. The residual impressions left by distortion
(<em>v&#257;san&#257;</em>; literally perfumings) explain the mere
appearance of things as real. Beyond that, he asserts that habituation
to this distortion prevents conventional and ultimate reality from
appearing united in an appearing object. This explanation of the
psychology of error differs markedly from earlier Tibetan explanations
and constitutes the sixth difficult point.</p>

<p>
In Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s mature philosophy the universal altruistic
principle is the sole criterion for distinguishing authentic
Mah&#257;y&#257;na views and practices from non-Mah&#257;y&#257;na
ones. By privileging the principle in this way he is able to assert
that any authentic realization of truth is a realization of the way
things are, namely, a realization of no <em>sva-bh&#257;va</em>
(own-being, own-nature, intrinsic identity). For Tsongkhapa,
therefore, H&#299;nay&#257;nists (by which he means followers of the
basic Buddhist doctrine of the Four Noble Truths set forth in the
earliest scriptures), necessarily have the same authentic knowledge of
reality. Were they not to have such knowledge, he argues, they could
not have reached the goals they had (the seventh point).</p>

<p>
Finally, Tsongkhapa has a robust explanation of the difference between
true and false on the covering or conventional level. He denies any
difference between a false object (a dream lottery ticket, for
example) and a real one; as appearances, he asserts, both are equally
false, only convention decides which is true. All phenomena equally
lack truth. In Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s mature philosophy, therefore, all
appearance is false&mdash;to appear is to appear as being truly what
the appearance is of, and the principle of dependent origination
precludes such truth from according with the way things actually
are.</p>

<p>
Tsongkhapa holds that sentences and their content and minds and what
appears to them function in the same way. Saying (1) of a set of
&ldquo;true&rdquo; and &ldquo;false&rdquo; statements that they are
all equally untrue, and (2) saying of unmediated sense-based
perception or mistaken ideas that they are equally untrue is in fact
to say the same thing. The truth in both is decided by convention, not
by something inhering in the true statement (or its content), or the
valid perception (or its object). Tsongkhapa, therefore, argues that
since all appearance of true existence is false, the Buddha knows all
phenomena, but that they do not appear to him as truly existent (the
eighth difficult point).</p>

<p>
Towards the very end of his life, in his<em> Middle-Length Treatise on
the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment</em> and <em>Illuminating the
Intent</em>, Tsongkhapa defends his views against Rongt&ouml;n&rsquo;s
(<em>Rong stong shes bya kun rig</em>, 1367&ndash;1449) criticism that
his earlier and later works are inconsistent. Tsongkhapa extends his
comparison of Chandrak&#299;rti&rsquo;sand Bh&#257;viveka&rsquo;s
interpretations of N&#257;g&#257;rjuna to more clearly identify a less
subtle object of negation in the works of
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra-sv&#257;tantrika-madhyamaka writers, particularly
J&ntilde;&#257;nagarbha (eighth century) and
&#346;&#257;ntarak&#7779;ita (Hopkins 2008: Part One; Yi 2015).
Tsongkhapa finds in their works an analysis leading beyond the
Yog&#257;c&#257;ra&rsquo;s mere absence of a substantial difference
between known object and knowing subject, but limited insofar as it
negates the ultimate truth of all objects appearing to conventional
awareness, while still allowing room for an object of negation that
does not appear to sense perception.</p>

<p>
Cowherds (2011) and Falls (2010) suggest parallels between the issues
raised by the Sv&#257;tantrika&ndash;Pr&#257;sa&#7749;gika difference
and more recent work in Western philosophy. They are helpful for those
familiar with Western philosophy but unfamiliar with Tsongkhapa,
giving an overview of questions that arise from the interaction of
philosophical traditions from different cultures. Falls argues that
Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s philosophy is a <em>therapeutea</em> not a
<em>theoria</em>, and draws parallels between issues raised by
Tsongkhapa and John McDowell&rsquo;s interpretation of Wilfrid Sellars
in particular.</p>

<h2 id="Herm">4. Hermeneutics</h2>

<p>
A distinctive feature of Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s mature philosophy is the
centrality he accords hermeneutics, and the particular stratification
of the philosophical systems it creates. His focus on hermeneutics
stems in no small measure from his acceptance of the Kangyur as a true
record of authentic statements of the Buddha, and also from his wish
to discredit Dolpopa&rsquo;s views. According to Tsongkhapa, and
worked out in detail in his <em>Essence of Eloquence</em>, the given
record of the Buddha&rsquo;s diverse statements seems to contain
contradictions, so a reader must decide on their own criteria for
interpreting them. No statement of the Buddha can serve as a primary
hermeneutic principle, so that principle necessarily becomes human
reason (<em>yukti; rigs pa</em>).</p>

<p>
When human reason is brought to bear on the diverse statements of the
Buddha, it concludes that all statements that an essential or
intrinsic identity exists, or any statements that presupposes that,
cannot be taken literally, at face value. This is because human
reason, when it analyzes the ultimate truth of any object or
statement, finds it empty of anything intrinsic to it that would make
it true. According to Tsongkhapa, the line of reasoning that leads
most clearly to this conclusion is dependent origination.</p>

<p>
Statements that require interpretation Tsongkhapa groups into those of
different Buddhist philosophical schools: in ascending order, Hearer
(<em>&#347;r&#257;vaka</em>) schools based on older Buddhist sources
(the Vaibh&#257;&#7779;ika and Sautr&#257;ntika), Yog&#257;c&#257;ra
schools following Asa&#7749;ga and Dign&#257;ga/Dharmak&#299;rti, and
non-Pr&#257;sa&#7749;gika Madhyamaka schools following Bh&#257;viveka
and &#346;&#257;ntarak&#7779;ita. The Pr&#257;sa&#7749;gika-madhyamaka
school of Chandrak&#299;rti alone captures the final intention of the
Buddha. Tsongkhapa was certainly not the first doxographer, but his
clear and definitive categories had immense influence on later
writers, so much so they have anachronistically been read back into
works that were written before his time.</p>

<p>
Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s particular hermeneutics, the primary means he
employs to lead readers to his philosophical insight, allows him to
characterize particular, authentic, Buddhist philosophies as wrong
(because they are wrong from a Pr&#257;sa&#7749;gika perspective), yet
right from the perspective of those particular systems. They are right
because the philosophies have particular roles to play in a larger,
grander scheme. This scheme is part of the larger philosophy of a
perfect person whose views are in perfect accord
(<em>tath&#257;gata</em>) with the way things are, i.e., dependently
originated, and whose statements are motivated solely by the benefit
they have to those who hear them.</p>

<p>
In this way, Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s hermeneutics lead to, or incorporate,
a second principle, namely, <em>bodhicitta</em>. The word
<em>bodhicitta</em> has at least six different, but interrelated
meanings in different contexts (Wangchuk 2007). In his philosophical
works Tsongkhapa uses it to mean a universal, altruistic principle
(not unlike the <em>logos</em>) that explains, primarily, the genesis
of the Buddha&rsquo;s diverse statements, i.e., explains why a person
with perfect intellect and powers of expression would make statements
that seem to contain contradictions.</p>

<p>
This principle plays a central role in Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s assertion
that all authentic attainments, without distinction, are based on an
authentic insight into emptiness (the seventh of the eight difficult
points listed above), and it leads him to assert that the origin of
the Mah&#257;y&#257;na is located in <em>bodhicitta</em>, and
<em>bodhicitta</em> alone</p>

<h2 id="Ethi">5. Ethics</h2>

<p>
Tsongkhapa is part of a long, shared, Indo-Tibetan Buddhist tradition
that conceives of ethical conduct not in absolute terms, but in the
context of different individuals in different situations. There is an
unspoken presupposition that ethical statements are grounded in
reality, in the sense that suffering (<em>du&#7717;kha</em>) comes
from actions (<em>karma</em>) that are not in accord with the way
things actually are (<em>dngos po</em>&rsquo;<em>i gnas
lugs</em>). The person is ultimately not present as an ethical
subject, but is so, on a conventional or covering level, through the
natural working of dependent origination.</p>

<p>
Tsongkhapa groups such individuals into three separate categories
(those who privilege basic Buddhist codes, bodhisattvas, and
t&#257;ntrikas). Each is governed by an ethical code (<em>sdom
gsum</em>), each superior code subsuming the points of the lesser.
Beyond these three, his <em>Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path
to Enlightenment</em> suggests ordinary ethical conduct is codified as
well, in the main, in the ten ethical points
(<em>da&#347;a-ku&#347;ala-patha</em>) basic to any human life that
rises above the mere animal.</p>

<p>
The first of the three specifically Buddhist codes, the basic code,
primarily governs the behavior of monks and nuns. Since for Tsongkhapa
each higher code incorporates all the rules in the lower code, he
conceives of the seven (or even twelve) sub-codes making up the basic
code as, in descending order, containing fewer and fewer of the rules
that constitute the full code. Each of the sub-codes is designed for
particular people in particular human situations. Tsongkhapa does not
expect a butcher to be governed by the rule of not killing, for
example, and he does not expect a lawyer to be governed by the rule of
not lying. He avoids gross devaluation of the basic code by
privileging spiritual elites. In this, he takes a pragmatic approach
to ethics in line with his non-absolutist stance. For Tsongkhapa, it
is axiomatic that human life is not <em>ipso facto</em> privileged
above any other form of life, but his detailed explanation gives
greater &ldquo;weight&rdquo; to the karmic retribution that comes from
killing humans, and amongst humans, noble persons, for example, than
less fortunate forms of life.</p>

<p>
Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s explanation of the bodhisattva moral code presented
in the <em>Bodhisattva-bh&#363;mi</em> (Tatz 1986) follows naturally
from the importance he gives to the altruistic principle in his other
writing. He reconciles rules in the bodhisattva code that enjoin
behavior contradicting the basic code by positing an elite that,
through a noblesse oblige of the spiritually advanced, are required to
do things which would be unethical for an ordinary person. Their not
doing so constitutes an ethical lapse. For example, the basic code
prohibits actions that influence what food a donor puts in the begging
bowl (with a few exceptions for human flesh and so on), and prohibits
eating after noon. The bodhisattva code contradicts the basic code
insofar as it prohibits eating meat, even though, by so doing, the
donor does not get the opportunity to make charity. Tsongkhapa argues
that if a monk at the bodhisattva stage of development eats meat it
clashes with the dictates of the altruistic principle.</p>

<p>
Tsongkhapa accepts that the diverse body of literature, including the
historically latest Buddhist tantras (some of which are distinctly
antinomian in character), are the work of a fully awakened being
(buddha). The last of the three codes systematizes the conduct
espoused in these tantras. Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s presentation is
distinctive for finding a code complete with a full ordination
ceremony. The practical result of his presentation is to revalue the
basic code for monks, and devalue the ritual of tantric consecration
as it pertains to ethical conduct. It stresses ethical conduct even in
the context of works that appear, in line with the nihilistic drift of
Buddhist philosophy, to count ethical codes as a block to the highest
spiritual and philosophical attainment.</p>

<p>
Tsongkhapa argues that the tantric code is only for the very highest
spiritual elite, mainly monks and nuns. Tsongkhapa divides tantras
into two sections, and says the lower section is governed exclusively
by the bodhisattva code, supplemented by specific ritual injunctions
(<em>vrata</em>). He gives two interpretations of the rules for the
higher tantras, reserving the truly antinomian behavior for a
theoretical elite whose altruism is so strong, and whose understanding
and status is so enabled, that they engage in what ordinarily would be
condemned as gross immorality. According to this code, it is not
always an ethical lapse to eat meat, perhaps even human flesh, the
logic being that in certain specific and unusual circumstances, in a
person at this stage of development, such behavior would constitute a
skillful means to benefit others.</p>

<h2 id="Tant">6. Tantra</h2>

<p>
Over the years, a number of Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s closest disciples, who
had moved from one monastery or hermitage to another with him,
expressed their reservations about the nomadic way of life required by
their community. As Tsongkhapa himself was growing older, he too began
to succumb to the aches and pains of a life spent on the road, and
thus, prompted by the pleas of his senior students, he decided it was
time to create a more permanent base for his followers. In the pivotal
year of 1409 CE, Tsongkhapa made another significant contribution to
his legacy by establishing the mother monastery (<em>ma dgon</em>) for
what would ultimately develop into Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s Geluk school.
The monastery would initially be called Ganden
(<em>dGa</em>&rsquo; <em>ldan</em>, the pure land of joy or
God realm of Tu&#7779;ita). Ganden was situated on the slopes of
Wangkur Mountain (<em>bDang bskur ri</em>; the coronation mountain),
twenty-five miles to the northeast of Lhasa, at an altitude of about
four-thousand meters. After the groundbreaking ceremonies and the
laying of the foundations for the initial building were finished,
Tsongkhapa assigned the responsibility of overseeing the actual
construction to two of his most reliable senior disciples, Gyaltsab
Dharma Rinchen and D&uuml;lzin Drakpa Gyaltsen (<em>Dul&rsquo; dzin
grags pa rgyal mtshan</em>).</p>

<p>
As the population of the new monastery began to swell, with monks from
many different monasteries coming to join the new school, Tsongkhapa
started to consolidate his vision for a lineage that would unite both
S&#363;tra and Tantra while integrating both core concepts into the
three spheres (&rsquo;<em>khor lo gsum</em>) of study,
contemplation, and meditative contemplation, as well as in the active
daily engagement in the welfare of others (Jinpa 2019). These
developments led to a notable shift in Tsonkhapa&rsquo;s priorities,
with the advanced Highest Yoga tantra becoming the central emphasis of
both his writing and teaching. During a retreat period in 1411,
Tsongkhapa wrote two of his most influential tantric works, namely
<em>Lamp to Illuminate the Five Stages</em> (<em>Rim lnga rab tu gsal
ba</em>&rsquo;<em>i sgron me</em>) (Kilty 2013) and the
<em>Practical Guide to the Five Stages of Guhyasamaja Completion Stage
in a Single Sitting</em> (<em>Blo bzang grags pa</em>). The first of
these works is the most important commentary on the Guhyasamaja Tantra
which exists today. It leans heavily on concepts taken from
N&#257;g&#257;rjuna&rsquo;s <em>Five Stages</em>
(<em>Pa&ntilde;cakrama</em>), Aryadeva&rsquo;s <em>Lamp that Unites
the Practices</em> (<em>Caryamelapaka&shy;pradipa</em>), and a wide
array of supplementary texts related to the perfection stage found in
the Tibetan canonical collections (Kangyur and Tengyur).</p>

<p>
Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s second work on tantra, his <em>Practical Guide to
the Five Stages of Guhyasamaja Completion Stage in a Single
Sitting</em>, clearly differs from his first oeuvre in both structure
and style. It is much more concise, and closely follows
N&#257;ropa&rsquo;s <em>Lucid Summary of the Five Stages</em>
(<em>Pa&ntilde;cakramasa&#7747;graha prak&#257;&#347;a</em>) as its
main reference point. This text sets itself apart from contemporary
works by providing a practice-oriented and experiential instruction on
the key elements of the Guhyasamaja completion stages (Jinpa
2019).</p>

<p>
Tsongkhapa conceives of tantra as a subset of the Mah&#257;y&#257;na,
and to that extent all authentic Buddhist tantric activities are,
necessarily, authentically altruistic. What differentiates tantric
activity from other ordinary Mah&#257;y&#257;na activities is deity
yoga (<em>lha</em>&rsquo;<em>i rnal</em>
&rsquo;<em>byor</em>), i.e., whether or not, from a first
person perspective, the person is acting as a perfect, divine subject
when engaging in (primarily ritual) behavior.</p>

<p>
Tsongkhapa wrote works on the <em>Vajrabhairava</em>,
<em>Cakrasa&#7747;vara</em> (Gray 2017), and <em>K&#257;lacakra</em>
tantras, but is best known for his exposition of the Guhyasam&#257;ja
tantra based on Indian commentaries associated with the names of
N&#257;g&#257;rjuna and &#256;ryadeva, particularly his short but
influential Commentary on the
<em>J&ntilde;&#257;na-vajra-samuccaya</em> (<em>Ye shes rdo rje kun
las &rsquo;dus pa</em>&rsquo;<em>i &#7789;&#299; k&#257;</em>) (1410),
and magisterial <em>Clear Exposition of the Five Stages of
Guhyasam&#257;ja</em> (<em>gSang</em> &rsquo;<em>dus rim lnga gsal
sgron</em>) (1411) (Thurman 2010; Kilty 2013). He accords great
importance to esoteric yoga. In this respect, his work is firmly
located in the mainstream Tibetan tradition, influenced in particular
by the translator Mar pa (<em>Mar pa Chos kyi blo gros</em>,
1012&ndash;1097), who spread the <em>Six Teachings of N&#257;ropa</em>
(<em>N&#257; ro chos drug</em>), a later Indian synthesis of diverse
tantric practices, in Tibet. Based on this Tsongkhapa gives detailed
explanations of the <em>n&#257;&#7693;&#299;</em> (channels for the
energy or feelings that run through the tantric practitioner&rsquo;s
body), <em>cakra</em> (circles of channels in the heart, throat, and
other central points up the center of the body from the bottom of the
spine, or tip of the sex organ, to the top of the head) and
<em>ca&#7751;&#7693;al&#299;</em> (an intense pleasure experienced as
heat that spreads through the channels and fills the body). Tsongkhapa
is praised, in particular, for his explanation of theory and praxis
associated with the illusory body (<em>m&#257;y&#257;-k&#257;ya</em>;
<em>sgyu lus</em>) and clear light (<em>Prabh&#257;svara</em>;
&rsquo;<em>od gsal</em>), a skillful adaptation of his
understanding of the two truths to yogic praxis (Natanya 2017). This
is summed up nicely in the statement,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The <em>Pa&ntilde;cakramasa&#7747;grahaprak&#257;&#347;a</em>
(<em>Illumination of the Summary of the Five Steps</em>), a short
treatise attributed to N&#257;ropa (956&ndash;1040), combining the Six
Teachings with the &ldquo;Five Steps&rdquo;
(<em>pa&ntilde;cakrama</em>) of the &#256;rya tradition provided Tsong
kha pa with the basic ideas of his Tantric system. (Tillemans
1998)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="DeatLega">7. Death and Legacy</h2>

<p>
On 12 November 1419, Tsongkhapa passed away at Ganden Monastery. His
most important works, including <em>The Great Treatise on the Stages
of the Path to Enlightenment</em>, the hermeneutical <em>The Essence
of Eloquence</em>, and his works on the Guhyasam&#257;ja tantra were
published on woodblock prints to enable wider distribution. This meant
that they were able to reach a broad readership from very early on,
with all of his writings being published as <em>Collected Works</em>
by the end of the fifteenth century. Later Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s original
publications were addended by the collected works of his two most
important disciples and immediate successors, Gyaltsab Dharma Rinchen
and Khedrup Gelek Pelsang (<em>mKhas grub rje dge legs dpal
bzang</em>, 1385&ndash;1438), comprising eight and twelve large
volumes, respectively. The combined collected works are known as the
<em>Father and Sons Collected Works</em> (<em>rJe yab sras gsum gyi
gsungs</em>&rsquo;<em> bum</em>) and constitute an essential
canonical collection for members of Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s Geluk
tradition.</p>

<p>
The first biography of Tsongkhapa appears to have been penned by his
close student Jampel Gyatso (&rsquo;<em>Jam dpal rgya
mtsho</em>), a work which remains overshadowed by the aforementioned
official biographies by Khedrup Gelek Pelsang, who would write a
conventional biography called <em>Stream of Faith</em> (<em>Dad
pa</em>&rsquo;<em>i</em> &rsquo;<em>jug ngog</em>), as well as a
secret work which would further shed light on the more esoteric
dimensions of Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p>
According to Tibetan historians, the precise beginning of the Ganden,
or as it is more commonly known, the Geluk tradition, can be
considered to begin with the founding of the mother monastery Ganden
in 1409. Western historians, however, are less convinced, both about
this exact founding date, and also as to Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s intentions
to found a new Tibetan Buddhist school in the first place. The
emergence of an actual tradition can also be attributed to Khedrup
Gelek Palsang and his attempts to unite and consolidate a new school
within the Tibetan tradition (Jinpa 2019). What can be unequivocally
stated, however, is that with the establishment of the three great
monasteries of Ganden, Drepung, and Sera by the time of
Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s death, the infrastructure and the outer framework
for the emergence of a new school was firmly put in place.</p>

<p>
Most importantly, Tsongkhapa provided an independent and innovative
approach to the Buddhist canon and its soteriological practices. His
scholarship on the ultimate truth of emptiness, as expounded by
N&#257;g&#257;rjuna and commented upon by Buddhap&#257;lita and
Chandrak&#299;rti, is based on a form of contemplation which is rooted
in a critical engagement with these texts, and supplemented by a deep
meditative practice for extended periods of time. In sum, both the
theoretical and practical foundations for a new tradition were
provided by Tsongkhapa&rsquo;s exceptional emphasis on the development
of an integrated understanding of the entire Indian Buddhist
philosophical and spiritual heritage, both S&#363;tra and Tantra; his
strong endorsement of Buddhist ethics as being foundational for
Buddhist life, especially for the monastic community; and his espousal
of meditative practice, supported by an overall understanding of the
entire Buddhist path which can be acquired through focused study.</p>

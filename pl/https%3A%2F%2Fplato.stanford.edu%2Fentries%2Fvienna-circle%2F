<h1>Vienna Circle</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Jun 28, 2006; substantive revision Tue May 7, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The Vienna Circle was a group of early twentieth-century philosophers
who sought to reconceptualize empiricism by means of their
interpretation of then recent advances in the physical and formal
sciences. Their radically anti-metaphysical stance was supported by an
empiricist criterion of meaningfulness and a broadly logicist
conception of mathematics. They denied that any principle or claim was
synthetic <em>a priori</em>. Moreover, they sought to account for the
presuppositions of scientific theories by regimenting such theories
within a logical framework so that the important role played by
conventions, either in the form of definitions or of other analytical
framework principles, became evident. The Vienna Circle&rsquo;s
theories were constantly changing. In spite (or perhaps because) of
this, they helped to provide the blueprint for analytical philosophy
of science as meta-theory&mdash;a &ldquo;second-order&rdquo;
reflection on &ldquo;first-order&rdquo; sciences. While the Vienna
Circle&rsquo;s early form of logical empiricism (or logical positivism
or neopositivism: these labels will be used interchangeably here) no
longer represents an active research program, recent history of
philosophy of science has unearthed much previously neglected variety
and depth in the doctrines of the Circle&rsquo;s protagonists, some of
whose positions retain relevance for contemporary analytical
philosophy.</p>

<h2 id="IntRem">1. Introductory Remarks</h2>

<p>
While it is in the nature of philosophical movements and their leading
doctrines to court controversy, the Vienna Circle and its philosophies
did so more than most. To begin with, its members styled themselves as
conceptual revolutionaries who cleared the stables of academic
philosophy by showing metaphysics not simply to be false, but to be
cognitively empty and meaningless. In addition, they often associated
their attempt to overcome metaphysics with their public engagement for
scientific Enlightenment reason in the ever-darkening political
situation of 1920s and 1930s central Europe. Small wonder then that
the Vienna Circle has sharply divided opinion from the start. There is
very little beyond the basic facts of membership and its record of
publications and conferences that can be asserted about it without
courting some degree of controversy. (For English-language survey
monographs and articles on the Vienna Circle, see Kraft 1950 [1953];
J&oslash;rgensen 1951; Ayer 1959b; Passmore 1967; Hanfling 1981;
Stadler 1998; Richardson 2003. Particularly rich in background and
bio-bibliographical materials is Stadler 1997 [2015]. The best short
introductory book has remained untranslated: Haller 1993. For popular
overviews see Sigmund 2015 [2017] and Edmonds 2020.)</p>

<p>
Fortunately, more than four decades worth of recent scholarship in
history of philosophy of science now allows at least some disputes to
be put into perspective. (See, e.g., the following at least in part
English-language collections of articles and research monographs:
Haller 1982; McGuinness 1985, 2011; Rescher 1985; Gower 1987; Proust
1989; Zolo 1989; Coffa 1991; Spohn 1991; Uebel 1991; Bell &amp;

2016; Ebbs 2017; Pihlstr&ouml;m, Stadler, &amp; Weidtmann 2017;
Schiemer 2017; Tuboly 2017; Carus 2018; Cat &amp; Tuboly 2019; Makovec
&amp; Shapiro 2019; Schuster 2020; Damb&ouml;ck &amp; Wolters 2021;
Lutz &amp; Tuboly 2021; Damb&ouml;ck, Sandner, &amp; Werner 2022;
Damb&ouml;ck &amp; Tuboly 2022; Ramharter 2022; Romizi, Walz, &amp;
Nemeth 2022; Uebel &amp; Limbeck-Lilienau 2022; Bentley 2023; Morris
2023; Stadler 2023; Richardson 2024; Richardson &amp; Tuboly 2024.)
What distinguishes these works from valuable earlier collections like
Schilpp 1963; Hintikka 1975; and Achinstein &amp; Barker 1969 is the
calling into question of the assumption that we understood the Vienna
Circle so well that its consequences are straightforward. (Many other
pieces of new Vienna Circle scholarship are spread throughout
philosophical journals and essay collections with more systematic or
wider historical scope; important work has also been done in German,
Italian and French language publications but these remain unreferenced
here.)</p>

<p>
Two facts must be clearly recognized if a proper evaluation of the
Vienna Circle is to be attempted. The first is, that, despite its
relatively short existence, even some of the most central theses of
the Vienna Circle underwent radical changes. The second is that its
members were by no means of one mind in all important matters;
occasionally they espoused perspectives so radically at variance with
each other that even their ostensive agreements cannot remain wholly
untouched. Behind the rather thin public front, then, quite different
philosophical projects were being pursued by the leading participants
with, moreover, changing alliances. One way of taking account of this
is by speaking (as above) explicitly of the philosophies (in the
plural) of the Vienna Circle (and to avoid the singular definite
description) while using the expression &ldquo;Vienna Circle
philosophy&rdquo; (without an article) in a neutral generic sense.</p>

<p>
Recent scholarship has provided what the traditional view of Viennese
neopositivism lacks: recognition and documentation of the sometimes
sharply differentiated positions behind the generic surface. This does
not invalidate all previous scholarship, including some fundamental
criticisms of its positions, but it restores a depth to Vienna Circle
philosophy that was absent from the standard histories. The value of
this development must not be underestimated, for the recognition of
the Vienna Circle&rsquo;s sophisticated engagement with aspects of the
philosophical tradition and contemporaneous challenges calls into
question unwarranted certainties of our own self-consciously
post-positivist era. While there remains support for the view that
philosophical doctrines were held in the Vienna Circle that wholly
merited many of the standard criticisms to be cited below, there is
now also support for the view that in nearly all such cases, these
doctrines were already in their day opposed within the Circle itself.
While some of the Vienna Circle philosophies are dated and may even
be, as John Passmore once put it, as dead as philosophies can be,
others show signs of surprising vitality. Which ones these are,
however, remains a matter of debate.</p>

<p>
The lead pursued in this article is provided by the comment of a
long-time associate of the Vienna Circle, C.G. Hempel, made on the
occasion of the Carnap-Reichenbach centenary in 1991:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
When people these days talk about logical positivism or the Vienna
Circle and say that its ideas are <em>pass&eacute;</em>, this is just
wrong. This overlooks the fact that there were two quite different
schools of logical empiricism, namely the one of Carnap and Schlick
and so on and then the quite different one of Otto Neurath, who
advocates a completely pragmatic conception of the philosophy of
science&hellip;. And this form of empiricism is in no way affected by
any of the fundamental objections against logical positivism&hellip;.
(quoted in Wolters 2003: 117)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
While differing with Hempel&rsquo;s specific claim about how the two
&ldquo;schools&rdquo; divide, the aim here is to fill out his
suggestive picture by indicating what Schlick, Carnap and Neurath
stand for philosophically and why the different wings of the Vienna
Circle require differentiated assessments. After reviewing the basic
facts and providing an overall outline of Vienna Circle philosophy (in
 <a href="#BasPerActOveDoc">section 2</a>),
 this article considers various doctrines in greater detail by way of
discussing standard criticisms with the appropriate distinctions in
mind (in
 <a href="#SelDocTheCri">section 3</a>).
 No comprehensive assessment of the Vienna Circle and the work of its
members can be attempted here, but some basic conclusions will be
drawn (in
 <a href="#ConRem">section 4</a>).</p>
 
<h2 id="BasPerActOveDoc">2. The Basics: People, Activities and Overview of Doctrines</h2>

<h3 id="Per">2.1 People</h3>

<p>
The Vienna Circle was a group of scientifically trained philosophers
and philosophically interested scientists who met under the (nominal)
leadership of Moritz Schlick for often weekly discussions of problems
in the philosophy of science during academic terms in the years from
1924 to 1936. As is not uncommon with such groups, its identity is
blurred along several edges. Not all of those who ever attended the
discussions can be called members, and not all who attended did so
over the entire period. Typically, attention is focused on long-term
regulars who gained prominence through their philosophical
publications, but even these do not in all cases fall into the period
of the Vienna Circle proper. It is natural, nevertheless, to consider
under the heading &ldquo;Vienna Circle&rdquo; also the later work of
leading members who were still active in the 1940s, 50s and 60s.
Finally, there is the so-called periphery of international contacts
and visitors that prefigured the post-World War II network of
analytical philosophers of science. In the present article the
emphasis will be placed on the long-term regulars whose contributions
will be followed, selectively, into the post-Schlick era.</p>

<p>
According to its unofficial manifesto (see
 <a href="#OveDoc">section 2.3</a>
 below), the Circle had &ldquo;members&rdquo; and recognized others as
&ldquo;sympathetic&rdquo; to its aims. It included as members, besides
Schlick who had been appointed to Mach&rsquo;s old chair in Philosophy
of the Inductive Sciences at the University of Vienna in 1922, the
mathematician Hans Hahn, the physicist Philipp Frank, the social
scientist Otto Neurath, his wife, the mathematician Olga Hahn-Neurath,
the philosopher Viktor Kraft, the mathematicians Theodor Radacovic and
Gustav Bergmann and, since 1926, the philosopher and logician Rudolf
Carnap. (Even before World War I, there existed a similarly oriented
informal discussion group that included Frank, Hahn and Neurath.
During the time of the Schlick Circle, Frank resided in Prague
throughout, Carnap did so from 1931.) Further members were recruited
among Schlick&rsquo;s students, like Friedrich Waismann, Herbert Feigl
and Marcel Natkin, others were recruited among Hahn&rsquo;s students,
like Karl Menger and Kurt G&ouml;del. Though listed as members in the
manifesto, Menger and Kraft later wanted to be known only as
sympathetic associates, like, all along, the mathematician Kurt
Reidemeister and the philosopher and historian of science Edgar
Zilsel. (Karl Popper was never a member or associate of the Circle,
though he studied with Hahn in the 1920s and in the early 1930s
discussed its doctrines with Feigl and Carnap.) Over the years, other
participants (not listed in the manifesto) included other students of
Schlick&rsquo;s and Hahn&rsquo;s like Bela von Juhos, Josef
Sch&auml;chter, Walter Hollitscher, Heinrich Neider, Rose Rand, Josef
Rauscher and K&auml;the Steinhardt, a secondary teacher, Robert
Neumann, and, as notable thinkers with independent connections, the
jurist and philosopher Felix Kaufmann (also a member of F.A. von
Hayek&rsquo;s &ldquo;Geistkreis&rdquo;) and the innovative
psychologist Egon Brunswik (coming, like the even more loosely
associated sociologists Paul Lazarsfeld and Marie Jahoda, from the
pioneering Karl B&uuml;hler&rsquo;s University Institute of
Psychology).</p>

<p>
Despite its prominent position in the rich, if fragile, intellectual
culture of inter-war Vienna and most likely due to its radical
doctrines, the Vienna Circle found itself virtually isolated in most
of German speaking philosophy. The one exception was its contact and
cooperation with the Berlin Society for Empirical (later: Scientific)
Philosophy (the other point of origin of logical empiricism). The
members of the Berlin Society sported a broadly similar outlook and
included, besides the philosopher Hans Reichenbach, the logicians Kurt
Grelling and Walter Dubislav, the psychologist Kurt Lewin, the surgeon
Friedrich Kraus and the mathematician Richard von Mises. (Its leading
members Reichenbach, Grelling and Dubislav were listed in the
Circle&rsquo;s manifesto as sympathisers.) At the same time, members
of the Vienna Circle also engaged directly, if selectively, with the
Warsaw logicians (Tarski visited Vienna in 1930, Carnap later that
year visited Warsaw and Tarski returned to Vienna in 1935). Probably
partly because of its firebrand reputation, the Circle also attracted
a series of visiting younger researchers and students including Carl
Gustav Hempel from Berlin, Hasso H&auml;rlen from Stuttgart, Ludovico
Geymonat from Italy, J&oslash;rgen J&oslash;rgensen, Eino Kaila, Arne
Naess and Ake Petzall from Scandinavia, A.J. Ayer from the UK, Albert
Blumberg, Charles Morris, Ernest Nagel and W.V.O. Quine from the USA,
H.A. Lindemann from Argentina and Tscha Hung from China. (The reports
and recollections of these former visitors&mdash;e.g. Nagel
1936&mdash;are of interest in complementing the Circle&rsquo;s
in-house histories and recollections which start with the unofficial
manifesto&mdash;Carnap, Hahn, and Neurath 1929&mdash;and extend
through Neurath 1935c; Frank 1941a, 1949a; and Feigl 1943 to the
memoirs by Carnap 1963; Feigl 1969a, 1969b; Bergmann 1987; Menger
1994.)</p>

<p>
The aforementioned social and political engagement of members of the
Vienna Circle and of Vienna Circle philosophy for Enlightenment reason
had never made the advancement of its associates or proteg&eacute;es
easy in Viennese academia. From 1934 onwards, with anti-semitism
institutionalized and irrationalism increasingly dominating public
discourse, this engagement began to cost the Circle still more dearly.
Not only was the Verein Ernst Mach closed down early that year for
political reasons, but the ongoing dispersal of Circle members by
emigration, forced exile and death meant that after the murder of
Schlick in 1936 only a small rump was able to continue meetings for
another two years in Vienna:</p>

<ul>

<li>1931: Feigl emigrated to USA after a post-doctoral year
there.</li>

<li>1934: Hahn died, Neurath fled to Holland (and in 1940 to the
UK).</li>

<li>1935: Carnap emigrated to USA.</li>

<li>1936: Schlick was murdered.</li>

<li>1937: Menger emigrated to USA, Waismann to UK.</li>

<li>1938: Frank, Kaufmann, Brunswik, Bergmann emigrated to USA;
Zilsel, Rand to UK, later to USA; Hollitscher fled to Switzerland,
later to UK; Sch&auml;chter emigrated to Palestine.</li>

<li>1940: G&ouml;del emigrated to USA.</li>
</ul>

<p>
See Dahms 1995, for a full chronology of the exodus.</p>

<p>
But the end of the Vienna Circle as such did not mean the end of its
influence due to the continuing development of the philosophy of
former members (and the work of Kraft in the otherwise unregenerated
post-World War II Vienna who nurtured such different voices as Paul
Feyerabend and Ingeborg Bachmann and hosted Arthur Pap; on this see
Stadler 2008). Particularly through their work in American exile (esp.
Carnap at Harvard, Chicago and UCLA; Feigl at Iowa and Minnesota; less
obviously so Frank at Harvard) and that of earlier American visitors
(esp. Quine, Nagel), as well as through the work of fellow
emigr&eacute;es from the Berlin Society (esp. Reichenbach, Hempel) and
their students (Hilary Putnam, Wesley Salmon), logical empiricism
strongly influenced the post-World War II development of analytic
philosophy of science. By contrast, Waismann had little influence in
the UK where Neurath, already marginalized, had died in 1945. The full
story of logical empiricism&rsquo;s acculturation in the English
speaking world remains to be written. (See Howard 2003; Reisch 2005;
Uebel 2005a, 2010, 2020a; Douglas 2009; and Romizi 2012 for
consideration of the socio-political aspects of Vienna Circle
philosophy early and/or late that were neglected in the process and
remained long forgotten.)</p>

<h3 id="Act">2.2 Activities</h3>

<p>
After its formative phase which was confined to the Thursday evening
discussions, the Circle went public in 1928 and 1929 when it seemed
that the time had come for their emerging philosophy to play a
distinctive role not only in the academic but also the public sphere.
In November 1928, at its founding session, Schlick accepted the
presidency of the newly formed Verein Ernst Mach (Association Ernst
Mach), Hahn accepted one of its vice-presidencies and Neurath and
Carnap joined its secretariat. Originally proposed by the Austrian
Freidenkerbund (Free Thinker Association), the Verein Ernst Mach was
dedicated to the dissemination of scientific ways of thought and so
provided a forum for popular lectures on the new scientific
philosophy. In the following year the Circle stepped out under its own
name (invented by Neurath) with a manifesto and a special conference.
The publication of &ldquo;The Scientific World Conception: The Vienna
Circle&rdquo;, signed by Carnap, Hahn and Neurath and dedicated to
Schlick, coincided with the &ldquo;First Conference for the
Epistemology of the Exact Sciences&rdquo; in mid-September 1929,
organised jointly with the Berlin Society as an adjunct to the Fifth
Congress of German Physicists and Mathematicians in Prague (where
Frank played a prominent role in the local organising committee). (On
the production history and early reception of the manifesto see Uebel
2008.) A distinct philosophical movement appeared to be emerging, one
that was dedicated to ending the previous disputes of philosophical
schools by dismissing them, controversially, as strictly speaking
meaningless.</p>

<p>
Throughout the early and mid-1930s the Circle kept a high and
increasingly international profile with its numerous publications and
conferences. In 1930, the Circle took over, again together with the
Berlin Society, the journal <em>Annalen der Philosophie</em> and
restarted it under the name of <em>Erkenntnis</em> with Carnap and
Reichenbach as co-editors. (Besides publishing original articles and
sustaining lengthy debates, this journal featured selected proceedings
of their early conferences and documented the lecture series of the
Verein Ernst Mach and the Berlin Society as well as their
international congresses.) In addition, from 1928 until 1936, Schlick
and Frank served as editors of their book series &ldquo;Schriften zur
wissenschaftlichen Weltauffassung&rdquo; (&ldquo;Writings on the
Scientific World Conception&rdquo;), which published major works by
leading members and early critics like Popper, while Neurath edited,
from 1933 until 1939, the series &ldquo;Einheitswissenschaft&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Unified Science&rdquo;), which published more introductory
essays by leading members and sympathisers. Conference-wise, the
Circle organized, again with the Berlin Society, a &ldquo;Second
Conference for the Epistemology of the Exact Sciences&rdquo; as an
adjunct to the Sixth Congress of German Physicists and Mathematicians
in K&ouml;nigsberg in September 1930 (where Reidemeister played a
prominent role in the organization and G&ouml;del first announced his
incompleteness result in the discussion) and then began the series of
International Congresses on the Unity of Science with a
&ldquo;Pre-Conference&rdquo; just prior to the start of the Eighth
International Congress of Philosophy in Prague in September 1934.
This, their last conference in Central Europe, was followed by the
International Congresses of various sizes in Paris (September 1935,
July 1937), Copenhagen (June 1936), Cambridge, England (July 1938),
Cambridge, Mass. (September 1939), all in the main organized by
Neurath; a smaller last gathering was held in Chicago in September
1941. By 1938 their collective publication activity began to centre on
a monumentally planned <em>International Encyclopedia of Unified
Science</em>, with Neurath as editor-in-chief and Carnap and Charles
Morris as co-editors; by the time of Neurath&rsquo;s death in 1945,
only 10 monographs had appeared and the series was wound up in 1970
numbering 20 monographs under the title &ldquo;Foundations of the
Unity of Science&rdquo; (notably containing Thomas Kuhn&rsquo;s
<em>Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em> amongst them).</p>

<p>
Individually, the members of the Vienna Circle published extensively
before, during and after the years of the Circle around Schlick. For
some (Frank, Hahn, Menger, Neurath), philosophy was only part of their
scientific output, with numerous monographs and articles in their
respective disciplines (mathematics, physics and social science);
others (Schlick, Carnap, Feigl, Waismann) concentrated on philosophy,
but even their output cared relatively little for traditional concerns
of the field. Here it must be noted that two early monographs by
Schlick (1918/25) and Carnap (1928a), commonly associated with the
Vienna Circle, mostly predate their authors&rsquo; participation there
and exhibit a variety of influences not typically associated with
logical positivism (see
 <a href="#VieCirHis">section 3.7</a>
 below). Moreover, important monographs by Frank (1932), Neurath
(1931a), Carnap (1934c [1937]) and Menger (1934) in the first half of
the 1930s represent moves away from positions that had been held in
the Circle before and contradict its orthodox profile. Yet the
Circle&rsquo;s orthodoxy, as it were, is not easily pinned down
either. Schlick himself was critical of the manifesto of 1929 and gave
a brief vision statement of his own in &ldquo;The Turning Point in
Philosophy&rdquo; (1930). A long-planned book by Waismann of updates
on Wittgenstein&rsquo;s thought, to which Schlick was extremely
sympathetic, was never completed as originally planned and only
appeared posthumously (Waismann 1965; for related material see Baker
2003 and Manninen 2011). Comparison with rough transcripts of the
Circle&rsquo;s discussions in the early 1930s (for transcripts from
between December 1930 and July 1931 see Stadler 1997 [2015:
69&ndash;123]) suggest that Waismann&rsquo;s Wittgensteinian
&ldquo;Theses&rdquo;, dated to &ldquo;around 1930&rdquo; (McGuinness
1967 [1979: Appendix B]), come closest to an elaboration of the
orthodox Circle position at that time (but which remained not
undisputed even then). Again, what needs to be stressed is that all of
the Circle&rsquo;s publications are to be understood as contributions
to ongoing discussions among its members and associates.</p>

<h3 id="OveDoc">2.3 Overview of Doctrines</h3>

<p>
Despite the pluralism of the Vienna Circle&rsquo;s views, there did
exist a minimal consensus which may be put as follows. A theory of
scientific knowledge was propagated which sought to renew empiricism
by freeing it from the impossible task of justifying the claims of the
formal sciences. It will be noted that this updating did not leave
empiricism unchanged.</p>

<p>
Following the logicism of Frege and Russell, the Circle considered
logic and mathematics to be analytic in nature. Extending
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s insight about logical truths to mathematical ones
as well, the Circle considered both to be tautological. Like true
statements of logic, mathematical statements did not express factual
truths: devoid of empirical content they only concerned ways of
representing the world, spelling out implication relations between
statements. The knowledge claims of logic and mathematics gained their
justification on purely formal grounds, by proof of their derivability
by stated rules from stated axioms and premises. (Depending on the
standing of these axioms and premises, justification was conditional
or unconditional.) Thus defanged of appeals to rational intuition, the
contribution of pure reason to human knowledge (in the form of logic
and mathematics) was thought easily integrated into the empiricist
framework. (Carnap sought to accommodate G&ouml;del&rsquo;s
incompleteness results by separating analyticity from effective
provability and by postulating that arithmetic consisted of an
infinite series of ever richer arithmetical languages; see the
discussion and references in
 <a href="#AnaDisRelPri">section 3.2</a>
 below.)</p>

<p>
The synthetic statements of the empirical sciences meanwhile were held
to be cognitively meaningful if and only if they were empirically
testable in some sense. They derived their justification as knowledge
claims from successful tests. Here the Circle appealed to a criterion
of meaningfulness (cognitive significance) the correct formulation of
which was problematical and much debated (and will be discussed in
greater detail in
 <a href="#VerCriMetClaPer">section 3.1</a>
 below). Roughly, if synthetic statements failed testability in
principle they were considered to be cognitively meaningless (lacking
evaluatability of their truth) and to give rise only to
pseudo-problems (on account of the merely associative or emotive
meanings they did possess). No third category of significance besides
that of <em>a priori</em> analytical and <em>a posteriori</em>
synthetic statements was admitted: in particular, Kant&rsquo;s
synthetic <em>a priori</em> was banned as having been refuted by the
progress of science itself. (The theory of relativity showed what had
been held to be an example of the synthetic <em>a priori</em>, namely
Euclidean geometry, to be false as the geometry of physical space.)
Thus the Circle rejected the knowledge claims of metaphysics as being
neither analytic and <em>a priori</em> nor empirical and synthetic.
(On related but different grounds, they also rejected the knowledge
claims of normative ethics: whereas conditional norms could be
grounded in means-ends relations, unconditional norms remained
unprovable in empirical terms and so depended crucially on the
disputed substantive <em>a priori</em> intuition.)</p>

<p>
Given their empiricism, all of the members of the Vienna Circle also
called into question the principled separation of the natural and the
human sciences. They were happy enough to admit to differences in
their object domains, but denied the categorical difference in both
their overarching methodologies and ultimate goals in inquiry, which
the historicist tradition in the still only emerging social sciences
and the idealist tradition in philosophy insisted on. The
Circle&rsquo;s own methodologically monist position was sometimes
represented under the heading of &ldquo;unified science&rdquo;.
Precisely how such a unification of the sciences was to be effected or
understood remained a matter for further discussion (see
 <a href="#RedFouTwoCriParReb">section 3.3</a>
 below).</p>

<p>
It is easy to see that, combined with the rejection of rational
intuition, the Vienna Circle&rsquo;s exclusive apportionment of reason
into either formal <em>a priori</em> reasoning, issuing in analytic
truths (or contradictions), and substantive <em>a posteriori</em>
reasoning, issuing in synthetic truths (or falsehoods), severely
challenged the traditional understanding of philosophy. All members of
the Circle hailed the end of distinctive philosophical system
building. In line with the <em>Tractatus</em> claim that all
philosophy is really a critique of language, the Vienna Circle took
the so-called linguistic turn, the turn to representation as the
proper subject matter of philosophy. Philosophy itself was denied a
separate first-order domain of expertise and declared a second-order
inquiry. Whether the once queen of the sciences was thereby reduced to
the mere handmaiden of the latter was still left open. It remained a
matter of disagreement what type of distinctively philosophical
insight, if any, would remain legitimate. Just as importantly,
however, the tools of modern logic were employed also for
metatheoretical construction, not just for the reduction of empirical
claims to their observational base or, more generally, for the
derivation of their observational consequences. For the price of
abandoning foundationalist certainty this allowed for an enormous
expansion of the domain of empirical discourse. Ultimately, it opened
the space for the still ongoing discussions of scientific realism and
its alternatives (see
 <a href="#SciTheTheTerProRea">section 3.4</a>
 below).</p>

<p>
The Circle&rsquo;s leading protagonists differed in how they
conceptualized this reflexive second-order inquiry that the linguistic
turn had inaugurated. Nevertheless, they all agreed broadly that the
ways of representing the world were largely determined by convention.
A multitude of ideas hide behind this invocation of conventionality.
One particularly radical one is the denial of the apodicity of all
apriority, the denial of the claim that knowledge justified through
reason alone represents truths that are unconditionally necessary.
Another one is the imputation of agency in the construction of the
logico-linguistic frameworks that make human cognition possible, the
denial that conventionality could only mean acquiescence in tradition.
Whether such ideas were followed by individual members of the Circle,
however, depended on their own interests and influences. It is these
often overlooked or misunderstood differences that hold the key to
understanding the interplay of occasionally incompatible positions
that make up Vienna Circle philosophy. (As can be seen from some of
their internal disputes, moreover, these differences were also not
always obvious to the protagonists themselves.)</p>

<p>
To see a striking example, consider their overarching conceptions of
philosophy itself. Some protagonists retained the idea that philosophy
possessed a separate disciplinary identity from science and, like
Schlick, turned philosophy into a distinctive, albeit non-formal
activity of meaning determination. Others, like Carnap, agreed on the
distinction between philosophy and science but turned philosophy into
a purely formal enterprise, the so-called logic of science. Still
others went even further and, like Neurath under the banner of
&ldquo;unified science&rdquo;, also rejected philosophy as a separate
discipline and treated what remained of it, after the rejection of
metaphysics, as its partly empirical meta-theory, to be set beside the
logic of science. With Schlick, then, philosophy became the activity
of achieving a much clarified and deepened understanding of the
cognitive and linguistic practices actually already employed in
science and everyday discourse. By contrast, for Carnap, philosophy
investigated and reconstructed existing language fragments, developed
new logico-linguistic frameworks and suggested possible formal
conventions for science, while, for Neurath, the investigation of
science was pursued by an interdisciplinary meta-theory that
encompassed empirical disciplines, again with a pragmatic orientation.
Thus we find in apparent competition different conceptions of
post-metaphysical philosophy: the projects of experiential meaning
determination, of formal rational reconstruction and of naturalistic
explications of leading theoretical and methodological notions. (For
roughly representative early essay-length statements of their
positions see Schlick 1930, Carnap 1932a, and Neurath 1932a; later
restatements are given in Schlick 1937, Carnap 1936b, and Neurath
1936a, 1936b.) In the more detailed discussions below these
differences of overall approach will figure repeatedly (see also
 <a href="#StaCriSigPoiProExp">section 3.6</a>
 below).</p>

<p>
Criticisms of the basic positions adopted in the Vienna Circle are
legion, though it may be questioned whether most of them took account
of the sophisticated variations on offer. (Sometimes the
Circle&rsquo;s own writings are disregarded altogether and
&ldquo;logical positivism&rdquo; is discussed only via the proxy of
Ayer&rsquo;s popular exposition; see, e.g., Soames 2003.) But some
Neo-Kantians like Ernst Cassirer may claim that they too accepted
developments like the merely relative <em>a priori</em> and an
appropriate conception of the historical development of science.
Likewise, Wittgensteinians may claim that Wittgenstein&rsquo;s own
opposition to metaphysics only concerned false attempts to render it
intelligible: his merely ineffable but uneliminated metaphysics
concerned precisely what for him were essentials of ways of
representing the world. The commonest criticisms, however, concerned
not the uniqueness of the Vienna Circle&rsquo;s doctrines, or their
faithfulness to their supposed sources, but whether they were tenable
at all. Prominent objects of this type of criticism include the
verificationist theory of meaning and its claimed anti-metaphysical
and non-cognitivist consequences as well as its own significance; the
reductionism in phenomenalist or physicalist guises that appeared to
attend the Circle&rsquo;s attempted operationalisation of the logical
atomism of Russell and Wittgenstein; and the Circle&rsquo;s alleged
scientism in general and their formalist and a-historical conception
of scientific cognition in particular. These criticisms are discussed
in some detail below in order to assess why which of the associated
doctrines remain of what importance.</p>

<p>
As noted, the Vienna Circle did not last long: its philosophical
revolution came at a cost. Yet what was so socially, indeed
politically, explosive about what appears on first sight to be a
particularly arid, if not astringent, doctrine of specialist
scientific knowledge? In a large part, precisely what made it so
controversial philosophically: its claim to refute opponents not by
proving their statements to be false but by showing them to be
(cognitively) meaningless. Whatever the niceties of their
philosophical argument here, the socio-political impact of the Vienna
Circle&rsquo;s philosophies of science was obvious and profound. All
of them opposed the increasing groundswell of radically mistaken,
indeed irrational, ways of thinking about thought and its place in the
world. In their time and place, the mere demand that public discourse
be perspicuous, in particular, that reasoning be valid and premises
true&mdash;a demand implicit in their general ideal of
reason&mdash;placed them in the middle of crucial socio-political
struggles. Some members and sympathisers of the Circle also actively
opposed the then increasingly popular <em>v&ouml;lkisch</em>
supra-individual holism in social science as a dangerous intellectual
aberration. Not only did such ideas support racism and fascism in
politics, but such ideas themselves were supported only by radically
mistaken arguments concerning the nature and explanation of organic
and inorganic matter. So the first thing that made all of the Vienna
Circle philosophies politically relevant was the contingent fact that
in their day much political discourse exhibited striking epistemic
deficits. That some of the members of the Circle went, without logical
blunders, still further by arguing that socio-political considerations
can play a legitimate role in some instances of theory choice due to
underdetermination is yet another matter. This particular issue cannot
be pursued further here (see references at the end of
 <a href="#Per">section 2.1</a>
 above), nor the general topic of the Circle&rsquo;s embedding in
modernism and the discourse of modernity (see Putnam 1981b for a
reductionist, Galison 1990 for a foundationalist, Uebel 1996 for a
constructivist reading of their modernism, Dahms 2004 for an account
of personal relations with representatives of modernism in art and
architecture, Carus 2007 for placing Carnap in an updated
Enlightenment perspective; for a discussion of the Circle&rsquo;s
philosophical methodologies in the context of logical empiricism more
generally see Pincock 2016).</p>

<h2 id="SelDocTheCri">3. Selected Doctrines and their Criticisms</h2>

<p>
Even with these outlines of Vienna Circle philosophy in hand, its
controversial character is evident. The boldness of its claims made it
attractive but that boldness also seemed to be its undoing. Turning to
the questions of how far and, if at all, which forms of Vienna Circle
philosophy stand up to some common criticisms, both the synchronic
variations and the diachronic trajectories of its variants must be
taken into account. This will be attempted in the sections below.</p>

<p>
Before expectations are raised too high, however, it must also
remembered that in this article only the views of members of the
Vienna Circle can be discussed, even though the problematic issues
were pervasive in logical empiricism generally. (Compare the SEP
article on
 <a href="../logical-empiricism/">logical empiricism</a>;
 for articles on Reichenbach see, e.g, Spohn 1991 and Salmon &amp;
Wolters 1994; Richardson 2005, 2006; Curiel &amp; Padovani
2021&ndash;21; and, for the Berlin Group as a whole, Milkov &amp;
Peckhaus 2013.) Moreover, here the emphasis must lie on the main
protagonists: Schlick, Carnap and Neurath. (Neither Hahn or Frank, nor
Waismann or Feigl, for instance, can be discussed here as extensively
as their work deserves: see, e.g., Sigmund 1995, Uebel 2005b on Hahn;
Howard 2021, Reisch &amp; Tuboly 2021 on Frank; McGuinness 2011,
Makovec &amp; Shapiro 2019 on Waismann; Haller 2003, Neuber 2011 on
Feigl.) What will be noted, however, is that Vienna Circle philosophy
was by no means identical with the post-World War II logical
empiricism that has come to be known as the &ldquo;received
view&rdquo; of scientific theories, even though it would be hard to
imagine the latter wholly without the former (see
 <a href="#SciTheTheTerProRea">section 3.4</a>).</p>
 
<p>
To deepen the somewhat cursory overview of Vienna Circle philosophy
given above, we now turn to the discussion of the following issues:
first, the viability of the conceptions of empirical significance
employed by the Vienna Circle in its classical period; second, its
uses of the analytic-synthetic distinction; third, its supposedly
reductionist designs and foundationalist ambitions for philosophy;
fourth, its stances in the debate about realism or anti-realism with
regard to the theoretical terms in science; fifth, Carnap&rsquo;s
later ideas in response to some of the problems encountered; sixth,
the issue of the status of the meaning criterion itself (variably
referred to also as &ldquo;criterion of significance&rdquo; or
&ldquo;criterion of empirical significance&rdquo;) and of the point of
their critique of metaphysics; seventh, the Vienna Circle&rsquo;s
attitude towards history and of their own place in the history of
philosophy.</p>

<p>
These topics have been chosen for the light their investigation throws
on the Circle&rsquo;s own agendas and the reception of its doctrines
amongst philosophers at large, as well as for the relative ease with
which their discussion allows its development and legacy to be
charted. There can be little doubt about the enormous impact that the
members of the Vienna Circle had on the development of
twentieth-century philosophy. What is less clear is whether any of its
distinctive doctrines are left standing once the dust of their debates
has settled or whether those of its teachings that were deemed
defensible merged seamlessly into the broad church that analytic
philosophy has become (and, if so, what those surviving doctrines and
teachings may be).</p>

<p>
It must be noted, then, that the topics chosen for this article do not
exhaust the issues concerning which the members of the Vienna Circle
made significant contributions (which continue to stimulate work in
the history of philosophy of science). Important topics like that of
the theory and practice of unified science, of the nature of the
empirical basis of science (the so-called protocol-sentence debate)
and of the general structure of the theories of individual sciences
can only be touched upon selectively. Likewise, while the general
topic of ethical non-cognitivism receives only passing mentions, the
Circle&rsquo;s varied approaches to value theory cannot be discussed
here (for an overview see Rutte 1986, for detailed analyses see
Siegetsleitner 2014). Other matters, like the contributions made by
Vienna Circle members to the development of probability theory and
inductive logic, the philosophy of logic and mathematics (apart from
the guiding ideas of Carnap) and to the philosophy of individual
empirical sciences (physics, biology, psychology, social science),
cannot be discussed at all (see Friedman &amp; Creath 2007 and
Richardson &amp; Uebel 2007 for relevant essays with further
references). But it may be noted that with his &ldquo;logic of
science&rdquo; Carnap counts among the pioneers of what nowadays is
called &ldquo;formal epistemology&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 id="VerCriMetClaPer">3.1 Verificationism and the Critique of Metaphysics</h3>

<p>
Not surprisingly, it was the Circle&rsquo;s rejection of metaphysics
by means of their seemingly devastating criterion of cognitive
significance that attracted immediate opposition. (That they did not
deny all meaning to statements thus ruled out of court was freely
admitted from early on, but this &ldquo;expressive&rdquo; surplus was
considered secondary to so-called cognitive meaning and discountable
in science (see Carnap 1928b, 1932a).) Notwithstanding the
metaphysicans&rsquo; thunder, however, the most telling criticisms of
the criterion came from within the Circle or broadly sympathetic
philosophers. When it was protested that failure to meet an empiricist
criterion of significance did not make philosophical statements
meaningless, members of the Circle simply asked for an account of what
this non-empirical and presumably non-emotive meaning consisted in and
typically received no convincing answer. The weakness of their
position was rather that their own criterion of empirical significance
seemed to resist an acceptable formal characterization.</p>

<p>
To start with, it must be noted that long before the verification
principle proper entered the Circle&rsquo;s discourse in the late
1920s, the thought expressed by Mach&rsquo;s dictum that &ldquo;where
neither confirmation nor refutation is possible, science is not
concerned&rdquo; (1883 [1960: 587]) was accepted as a basic precept of
critical reflection about science. Responsiveness to evidence for and
against a claim was the hallmark of scientific discourse. Particularly
the group Frank-Hahn-Neurath, who formed part of a pre-World War I
discussion group (Frank 1941a, 1949a) sometimes called the
&ldquo;First Vienna Circle&rdquo; (Haller 1985; Uebel 2003, 2022), can
be presumed to be familiar with Mach&rsquo;s criterion. Beyond this,
still in the mid-1920s, Schlick (1926) convicted metaphysics for
falsely trying to express as logically structured cognition what is
but the inexpressible qualitative content of experience. Soon,
however, Carnap (1928b: &sect;7) edged towards a formal criterion of
meaningfulness by requiring empirically significant statements to be
such that experiential support for them or for their negation is at
least conceivable. Meaningfulness meant the possession of
&ldquo;factual content&rdquo; which could not, on pain of rendering
many scientific hypotheses meaningless, be reduced to actual
testability. Instead, the empirical significance of a statement had to
be conceived of as possession of the potential to receive direct or
indirect experiential support (via deductive or inductive
reasoning).</p>

<p>
In 1930, considerations of this sort appeared to receive a
considerable boost due to Waismann&rsquo;s reports of
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s meetings with him and Schlick. Wittgenstein had
discussed the thesis &ldquo;The sense of a proposition is [the method
of] its verification&rdquo; in conversations with Schlick and Waismann
on 22 December 1929 and 2 January 1930 (see McGuinness 1967 [1979: 47
and 79]) and Waismann elaborated it in his &ldquo;Theses&rdquo; which
were presented to the Circle as Wittgenstein&rsquo;s considered views.
While Wittgenstein appears to have thought of his dictum also as a
constitutive principle of meaning, in the Circle it was put to work
mainly as a demarcation criterion against metaphysics. Whether it was
always noted that verificationism as a theory of meaning and as a
criterion of cognitive significance must be distinguished (the former
entails the latter, but not vice versa) may be doubted, but striking
differences emerged all the same. Like Carnap&rsquo;s criterion of
significance of 1928, the version of the criterion which followed from
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s dictum also demanded only verifiability in
principle (and did not demand actual verifiability): like
Carnap&rsquo;s notion of experiential support, it worked with the mere
conceivability of verifiability. Yet Wittgenstein&rsquo;s criterion
required conclusive verifiability which Carnap&rsquo;s did not. (The
demand for conclusive verifiability was discussed in the meetings with
Wittgenstein.) By 1931, however, it had become clear to some that this
would not do. What Carnap later called the &ldquo;liberalization of
empiricism&rdquo; was underway and different camps became discernible
within the Circle. It was over this issue that the so-called left wing
with Carnap, Hahn, Frank and Neurath first distinguished itself from
the &ldquo;more conservative wing&rdquo; around Schlick. (See Carnap
1936/37: 422 and 1963a: &sect;9. Carnap 1936/37: 37n dated the
opposition to strict verificationism to &ldquo;about 1931&rdquo;.)</p>

<p>
In the first place, this liberalization meant the accommodation of
universally quantified statements and the return to salient aspects of
Carnap&rsquo;s 1928 conception. Everybody had noted that
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s criterion rendered universally quantified
statements meaningless. Schlick (1931) thus followed
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s own suggestion to treat &ldquo;hypotheses&rdquo;
instead as representing rules for the formation of verifiable singular
statements. (His abandonment of conclusive verifiability is indicated
only in Schlick 1936a.) By contrast, Hahn (1933, drawn from lectures
in 1932) pointed out that hypotheses should be counted properly
meaningful as well and that the criterion be weakened to allow for
less than conclusive verifiability. But other elements played into
this liberalization as well. One that began to do so soon was the
recognition of the problem of the irreducibility of disposition terms
to observation terms (more on this presently). A third element was
that disagreement arose as to whether the conceivability of
in-principle verifiability turned on what was merely logically
possible or on what was nomologically possible, as a matter of
physical law etc. A fourth element, finally, was that differences
emerged as to whether the criterion of significance was to apply to
all languages or whether it was to apply primarily to constructed,
formal languages. Schlick retained the focus on logical possibility
and natural languages throughout, but Carnap had firmly settled his
focus on nomological possibility and constructed languages by the
mid-thirties. Concerned with natural language, Schlick (1932, 1936a)
deemed all statements meaningful for which it was logically possible
to conceive of a procedure of verification; concerned with constructed
languages only, Carnap (1936/37) deemed meaningful only statements for
whom it was nomologically possible to conceive of a procedure of
confirmation of disconfirmation.</p>

<p>
Many of these issues were discussed at the Paris congress in 1935.
Already in 1932 Carnap had sought to sharpen his earlier criterion by
stipulating that those statements were meaningful that were
syntactically well-formed and whose non-logical terms were reducible
to terms occurring in the basic observational evidence statements of
science. While Carnap&rsquo;s focus on the reduction of descriptive
terms allowed for the conclusive verification of some statements, it
must be noted that his criterion also allowed universally quantified
statements to be meaningful in general, provided they were
syntactically and terminologically correct (1932a: &sect;2).
<em>Logical Syntax</em> (1934c [1937]: &sect;82) then affirmed
universal fallibilism, but it was not until one of his Paris addresses
that Carnap officially declared the criterion of cognitive
significance to be mere confirmability (1936a; its English translation
combines it with extraneous material). Carnap&rsquo;s new criterion
required neither verification nor falsification but only partial
testability and so fitted in with the latest development by including
as empirically significant not only universal statements but also
singular statements which now were recognized as irreducible to
observation statements, like the disposition statements of science
(see Carnap 1936/37; this was proposed first in another Paris congress
paper: 1936c). Disposition terms were thought to be linked to
observation statements by a variety of reduction postulates or longer
reduction chains, all of which provided only partial definitions
(despite their name they provided no eliminative reductions). Though
well-motivated initially, the device of introducing non-observational
terms in this way gave rise to a number of difficulties which impugned
the supposedly clear distinctions between logical and empirical
matters and analytic and synthetic statements (Hempel 1963).
Independently, Carnap himself (1939) soon gave up the hope that all
theoretical terms of science could be related to an observational base
by such reduction chains. This raised a serious problem for the
formulation of a criterion of cognitive significance: how was one to
rule out unwanted metaphysical claims while admitting as significant
highly abstract scientific claims?</p>

<p>
Consider that Carnap (1939, 1956b) admitted as legitimate theoretical
terms that are implicitly defined in calculi that are only partially
interpreted by correspondence rules between some select calculus terms
and expressions belonging to an observational language (via
non-eliminative reductions). The problem was that mere confirmability
was simply too weak a criterion to rule out some putative metaphysical
claims. Moreover, this problem arose for both the statement-based
approach to the criterion (taken by Carnap in 1928b, by Wittgenstein
in conversations in 1929/30 [see McGuinness 1967] and by Ayer both in
the first and the second editions of <em>Language, Truth and
Logic</em> [1936 &amp; 1946]) and for the term-based approach (taken
by Carnap since 1932). For the former approach, the problem was that
the empirical legitimacy of statements obtained via indirect testing
also transferred to any expressions that could be truth-functionally
conjoined to them (for instance, by the rule of
&lsquo;or&rsquo;-introduction). Statements thus became empirically
significant, however vacuous they had been on their own. For the
term-based approach, the problem was that, given the non-eliminability
of dispositional and theoretical terms, empirical significance was no
longer ascribable to individual expressions in isolation but became a
holistic affair, with little guarantee in turn for the empiricist
legitimacy of all the terms now involved.</p>

<p>
For most critics (even within the ranks of logical empiricism), the
problem of ruling out metaphysical statements while retaining the
terms of high theory remained unsolved. By 1950, in response to the
troubles of Ayer&rsquo;s two attempts to account for the indirect
testing of theoretical statements via their consequences, Hempel
conceded that it was &ldquo;useless to continue to search for an
adequate criterion of testability in terms of deductive relationships
to observation sentences&rdquo; (1950 [1959: 116]). The following
year, Hempel also abandoned the idea of using, as a criterion of
empirical significance, Carnap&rsquo;s method of translatability into
an antecedently determined empirical language consisting only of
observational non-logical vocabulary. Precisely because it was
suitably liberalized to allow abstract scientific theories with merely
partial interpretations, its anti-metaphysical edge was blunted: it
allowed for combination with &ldquo;some set of metaphysical
propositions, even if the latter have no empirical interpretation at
all&rdquo; (1951: 70). Hempel drew the holistic conclusion that the
units of empirical significance were entire theories and that the
measure of empirical significance itself was multi-criterial and,
moreover, allowed for degrees of significance. To many, this amounted
to the demise of the Circle&rsquo;s anti-metaphysical campaign. By
contrast, Feigl&rsquo;s reaction (1955) was to reduce the ambition of
the criterion of significance to the mere provision of necessary
conditions.</p>

<p>
Some further work was undertaken on rescuing and, again, debunking
versions of the statement-based criterion, but mostly not by (former)
members of the Vienna Circle. However, in response to the problem of
how to formulate a meaning criterion that suitably distinguished
between empirically significant and insignificant non-observational
terms, Carnap proposed a new solution in 1956. We will return to
discuss it separately (see
 <a href="#CarLatMeaCriProRam">section 3.5</a>
 below); for now we need only note that these proposals were highly
technical and applied only to axiomatized theories in formal
languages. They too, however, found not much favor amongst
philosophers. Yet whatever the problems that may or may not beset
them, it would seem that far more general philosophical considerations
contributed to the disappearance of the problem of the criterion of
cognitive significance from most philosophical discussions since the
early 1960s (other than as an example of mistaken positivism). These
include the increasing opposition to the distinctions between analytic
and synthetic statements and observational and theoretical terms as
well as a general sense of dissatisfaction with Carnap&rsquo;s
approach to philosophy which began to seem both too formalist in
execution and too deflationary in ambition. The entire philosophical
program of which the search for a precise criterion of empirical
significance was a part had begun to fall out of favor (and with it
technical discussions about the criterion&rsquo;s latest version).</p>

<p>
The widely perceived collapse of the classical Viennese project to
find in an empiricist meaning criterion a demarcation criterion
against metaphysics&mdash;we reserve judgement about Carnap&rsquo;s
last two proposals here&mdash;can be interpreted in a variety of ways.
It strongly suggests that cognitive significance cannot be reduced to
what is directly observable, whether that be interpreted in
phenomenalist or intersubjective, physicalist terms. In that important
but somewhat subsidiary sense, the collapse spelt the failure of many
of the reductivist projects typically ascribed to Viennese
neopositivism (but see
 <a href="#RedFouTwoCriParReb">section 3.3</a>
 below). Beyond that, what actually had failed was the attempt to
characterize for natural languages the class of cognitively
significant propositions by recursive definitions in purely logical
terms, either by relations of deducibility or translatability. What
failed, it seemed, was the attempt to apply a general conception of
philosophical analysis as purely formal, pursued also in other areas,
to the problem of characterizing meaningfulness.</p>

<p>
This general conception can be considered formalist in several senses.
It was formalist, first, in demanding the analysis of the meaning of
concepts and propositions in terms of logically necessary and
sufficient conditions: it was precise and brooked no exceptions. And
it was formalist, second, in demanding that such analyses be given
solely in terms of the logical relations of these concepts and
propositions to other concepts and propositions: it used the tools of
formal logic. There is also a third sense that is, however, applicable
predominantly to the philosophical project in Carnap&rsquo;s hands, in
that it was formalist in concentrating on the analysis of contested
concepts via their explication in formal languages. (Discussion of its
viability is deferred until
 <a href="#CarLatMeaCriProRam">section 3.5</a>
 and
 <a href="#StaCriSigPoiProExp">section 3.6</a>
 below.) The question arises whether all Vienna Circle philosophers
concerned with empirical significance in natural language were equally
affected, for the perceived collapse of the formalist project may
leave as yet untouched other ways of sustaining the objection that
metaphysics is, in some relevant sense, cognitively insignificant.
(Such philosophers in turn would have to answer the charge, of course,
that only the formalist project of showing metaphysics strictly
meaningless rendered the Viennese anti-metaphysics distinctive.)</p>

<p>
Even though the formalist project became identified with mainstream
logical empiricism (consider its prominence in confirmation theory and
in the theory of explanation), it was not universally subscribed to in
the Vienna Circle itself. In different ways, neither Schlick nor
Neurath or Frank adhered to it. As noted in the overview above,
Schlick&rsquo;s attempts to exhibit natural language meaning abjured
efforts to characterize it in explicitly formal terms, even though he
accepted the demand for necessary and sufficient conditions of
significance. In the end, moreover, Schlick turned away from his
colleagues&rsquo; search for a criterion of empirical significance. In
allowing talk of life after death as meaningful (1936a), for the very
reason that what speaks against it is only the empirical impossibility
of verifying such talk, Schlick&rsquo;s final criterion clearly left
empiricist strictures behind.</p>

<p>
By contrast, Neurath and Frank kept their focus on empirical
significance. While they rarely discussed these matters explicitly,
their writings give the impression that they chose to adopt (if not
retain) a contextual, exemplar-based approach to characterizing the
criterion of meaninglessness and so decided to forego the enumeration
of necessary and sufficient conditions (on Frank see Uebel 2011a).
Mach&rsquo;s precept cited earlier is an example of such a pragmatic
approach, as is Peirce&rsquo;s criterion of significance (1878)
endorsed by Quine (1969), which claims that significance resides in
the discernible difference made if a proposition is true rather than
false. Mach&rsquo;s pragmatic approach had been championed already
before verificationism proper by Neurath, Frank and Hahn who became,
like Carnap, early opponents of conclusive verifiability. (Indeed, it
is doubtful whether Neurath&rsquo;s radical fallibilism, clearly
expressed already in 1913, ever wavered.) This pragmatic understanding
found expression in Neurath&rsquo;s adoption (1935a, 1937) of K.
Reach&rsquo;s formulation of metaphysical statements as
&ldquo;isolated&rdquo; ones, as statements that do not derive from and
hold no consequences for those statements that we do accept on the
basis of empirical evidence or for logical reasons. (Hempel&rsquo;s
dismissal, in 1951, of this pragmatic indicator presupposes the
desiderata of the formalist project.) Finally, there is Frank&rsquo;s
suggestion (1963), coupled with his longstanding advice to combine
logical empiricism with pragmatism, that Carnap&rsquo;s purely logical
critique of metaphysics in (1932a) was bound to remain ineffective as
long as the actual use of metaphysics remained unexamined. It would be
worth investigating whether&mdash;if the critique of the alleged
reductionist ambitions of their philosophy could also be deflected
(see
 <a href="#RedFouTwoCriParReb">section 3.3</a>
 below)&mdash;the impetus of the anti-verificationist critique can be
absorbed by those with a pragmatic approach to the demarcation against
metaphysics. Much as with Quine&rsquo;s Peirce, such a criterion rules
out as without interest for epistemic activity all concepts and
propositions whose truth or falsity make no appreciable difference to
the sets of concepts and propositions we do accept already.</p>

<p>
An entirely different moral was drawn by Reichenbach (1938) and
thinkers indebted to his probabilistic conception of meaning and his
probabilistic version of verificationism, which escaped the criticisms
surveyed above by vagaries of its own. Such theorists perceive the
failure of the formalist model to accommodate the empirical
significance of theoretical terms to stem from its so-called deductive
chauvinism. In place of the exclusive reliance on the
hypothetical-deductive method these theorists employ non-demonstrative
analogical and causal inductive reasoning to ground theoretical
statements empirically. Like Salmon, these theorists adopt a form of
&ldquo;non-linguistic empiricism&rdquo; which they sharply
differentiate from the empiricism of the Vienna Circle (Salmon 1985,
2003 and Parrini 1995 [1998]).</p>

<p>
Now against both the pragmatic and the post-linguistic responses to
the perceived failure of the attempt to provide a precise formal
criterion of significance serious worries can be raised. Thus it must
be asked whether without a precise way of determining when a statement
&ldquo;makes an appreciable difference&rdquo;, criticism of
metaphysics based on such a criterion may be not be considered as a
biased dismissal rather than a demonstration of fact and so fall short
of what is needed. Likewise in the case of the anti-deductivist
response, it must be noted that a criterion based on analogical
reasoning will only be as effective as the strength of the analogy
which can always be criticized as inapt (and similarly for appeals to
causal reasoning). The very point of exact philosophy in a scientific
spirit&mdash;for many the very point of Vienna Circle philosophy
itself&mdash;seems threatened by such maneuvres. Acquiescence in the
perceived failure of the proposed criteria of significance thus comes
with a price: if not that of abandoning Vienna Circle philosophy
altogether, then at least that of formulating an alternative
understanding to how some of its ambitions ought to be understood.
(Recent reconstructive work on Neurath and Frank may be regarded in
this light.)</p>

<p>
A still different response&mdash;but one emblematic for the
philosophical public at large&mdash;is that of another of
Reichenbach&rsquo;s former students, Putnam, who came to reject the
anti-metaphysical project that powered verificationism in its
entirety. Repeatedly in his later years, Putnam called for a
refashioning of analytic philosophy as such, providing, as it were, a
philosophically conservative counterweight to Rorty&rsquo;s turn to
postmodernism. Putnam&rsquo;s reasons (the alleged self-refutation of
the meaning criterion) are still different from those surveyed above
and will be discussed when we return to reconsider the very point of
the Circle&rsquo;s campaign against metaphysics (see
 <a href="#StaCriSigPoiProExp">section 3.6</a>
 below).</p>

<h3 id="AnaDisRelPri">3.2 The Analytic/Synthetic Distinction and the Relative <em>A Priori</em></h3>

<p>
Whether the verificationist agenda was pursued in a formalist or
pragmatic vein, however, all members shared the belief that meaningful
statements divided exclusively into analytic and synthetic statements
which, when asserted, were strictly matched with <em>a priori</em> and
<em>a posteriori</em> reasoning for their support. The Vienna Circle
wielded this pairing of epistemic and semantic notions as a weapon not
only against the substantive <em>a priori</em> of the Schoolmen but
also against Kant&rsquo;s synthetic <em>a priori</em>. Moreover, their
notion of analyticity comprized both logical and mathematical truths,
thereby extending Wittgenstein&rsquo;s understanding of the former as
&ldquo;tautological&rdquo; in support of a broadly logicist
program.</p>

<p>
It is well known that this central component of the Vienna
Circle&rsquo;s arsenal, the analytic/synthetic distinction, came under
sharp criticism from Quine in his &ldquo;Two Dogmas of
Empiricism&rdquo; (1951a), less so that the criticism can only be
sustained by extending objections of a type first published by Tarski.
The argument is more complex, but here is a very rough sketch. So as
to discard the analytic/synthetic distinction as an unwarranted dogma,
Quine in &ldquo;Two Dogmas&rdquo; argued for the in-principle
revisability of all knowledge claims and criticised the impossibility
of defining analyticity in a non-circular fashion. The first argument
tells against the apodictic <em>a priori</em> of old (the eternal
conceptual verities), but, as we shall see, it is unclear whether it
tells against at least some of the notions of the <em>a priori</em>
held in the Vienna Circle. The second argument presupposes a
commitment to extensionalism that likewise can be argued not to have
been shared by all in the Circle. By contrast, Tarski had merely
observed that, at a still more fundamental level, he knew of no basis
for a sharp distinction between logical and non-logical terms. (For
relevant primary source materials see also Quine 1936, 1951b, 1963;
Carnap 1950a, 1955, 1963b, their correspondence and related previously
unpublished lectures and writings in Creath 1990a, the memoir Quine
1991, and Tarski 1936; for an account of Carnap&rsquo;s and
Quine&rsquo;s early interaction see Verhaegh 2023.)</p>

<p>
The central role on the Vienna Circle&rsquo;s side in this discussion
falls to Carnap and the reorientation of philosophy he sought to
effect in <em>Logical Syntax</em> (1934c [1937]). It was the notion of
the merely relative and therefore non-apodictic <em>a priori</em> that
deeply conditioned his notion of analyticity and allowed him to
sidestep Quine&rsquo;s fallibilist argument in a most instructive
fashion. In doing so Carnap built on an idea behind
Reichenbach&rsquo;s early attempt (1920) to comprehend the general
theory of relativity by means of the notion of a merely constitutive
<em>a priori</em>. Now Schlick had objected to the residual idealism
of this proposal (see Oberdan 2009) and preferred talk of conventions
instead and Reichenbach soon followed him in this (see Coffa 1991: Ch.
10). Carnap too did not speak of the relative <em>a priori</em> as
such (in returning to this terminology present discussions follow
Friedman 1994), but his pluralism of logico-linguistic frameworks
furnishes precisely that.</p>

<p>
First consider Schlick as a contrast class. Schlick (1934) appeared to
show little awareness of the language-relativity of the
analytic/synthetic distinction and spoke of analytic truths as
conceptual necessities that can be conclusively surveyed. This would
suggest that Schlick rejected Kant&rsquo;s apodictic synthetic <em>a
priori</em> but not the apodicity of analytic statements. Clearly, if
that were so, Quine&rsquo;s argument from universal fallibilism would
find a target here. Matters are not quite so clear-cut, however.
Schlick had long accepted the doctrine of semantic conventionalism
that the same facts could be captured by different conceptual systems
(1915): this would suggest that his analytic truths were conventions
that were framework-relative and as such necessary only in the very
frameworks they helped to constitute. Yet Schlick also did not
countenance the possibility of incommensurable conceptual frameworks:
any fact was potentially expressible in any framework (1936b). As a
result, Schlick did not accept the possibility that after the adoption
of a new framework the analytic truths of the old one may be no longer
assertable, that they would be discarded as no longer applicable even
in translation, as it were. Herein lay a point that Quine&rsquo;s
argument could exploit: Schlick&rsquo;s analytic truths remained
unassailable despite their language-relativity.</p>

<p>
Now Carnap, under the banner of the Principle of Tolerance (1934c
[1937]: &sect;17), abandoned the idea of the one universal logic which
had informed Frege, Russell and Wittgenstein before him. Instead, he
recognized a plurality of logics and languages whose consistency was
an objective matter even though axioms and logical rules were fixed
entirely by convention. Already due to this logical pluralism, the
framework-relativity of analytic statements went deeper for Carnap
than it did for Schlick. But Carnap also accepted the possibility of
incommensurability between seemingly similar descriptive terms and
between entire conceptual systems (1936a). Accepting the analytic
truths of the framework of our best physical theory may thus be
incompatible with accepting those of an earlier one, even if the same
logic is employed in both. Carnapian analyticities do not therefore
express propositions that we hold to be true unconditionally, but only
propositions true relative to their own framework: they are no longer
held to be potentially translatable across all frameworks.
Quine&rsquo;s charge of universal revisability (which itself needs
some modification; see Putnam 1978) thus misses its mark against
Carnap&rsquo;s analyticities.</p>

<p>
Concerning the criticism of the circular nature of the definition of
analyticity, Carnap responded that it pertained primarily to the idea
of analyticity in natural language whereas he was interested in
&ldquo;explications&rdquo; as provided by the logic of science (or
better, a logic of science, since there existed no unique logic of
science for Carnap). Explications are reconstructions in a formal
language of selected aspects of complex expressions that should not be
expected to model the original in all respects (1950b: Ch.1).
Moreover, Carnap held that explication of the notion of analyticity in
formal languages yielded the kind of precision that rendered the
complaint of circularity irrelevant: vague intuitions of meaning were
no longer relied upon. Those propositions of a given language were
analytic that followed from its axioms and, once the syntactic
limitations of the <em>Logical Syntax</em> period had been left
behind, from its definitions and meaning postulates, by application of
its rules: no ambiguity obtained.</p>

<p>
So it may appear that the notion of analyticity is easily delimitable
in Carnap&rsquo;s explicational approach: analytic propositions would
be those that constitute a logico-linguistic framework (and their
deductive consequences). But complications arose from the fact that,
on Carnap&rsquo;s understanding, not all propositions defining a
logico-linguistic framework need be analytic ones (1934c [1937]:
&sect;51). It was possible for a framework to consist not only of
logical rules, so-called L-rules whose entirety determines the notion
of logical consequence, but also of P-rules, which represent presumed
physical laws. So let analytic propositions be those framework
propositions whose negations are self-contradictory. Here a problem
arose once the syntactic constraints were dropped by Carnap so as to
allow semantic reasoning: now the class of analytic propositions was
widened to include not only logical and mathematical truths but also
those obtained by substitution of semantically equivalent expressions
introduced by so-called meaning postulates. How was one now to
explicate the idea that there can be non-analytic framework
propositions? For opponents like Quine, responding that the negations
of non-analytic framework propositions do not contradict meaning
postulates, was merely to dress up a presupposed notion of meaning in
pseudo-formal garb: while it provided what looked like formal
criteria, Carnap&rsquo;s method did not leave the circle of
intensional notions behind and so seemed to beg the question. Meaning
postulates (Carnap 1952), after all, could only be identified by
appearing on a list headed &ldquo;meaning postulates&rdquo; (as Quine
added in reprints of 1951a).</p>

<p>
Here one must note that in <em>Logical Syntax</em>, Carnap also
modified the thesis of extensionality he had previously defended
alongside Russell and Wittgenstein: now it merely claimed the
possibility of purely extensional languages and no longer demanded
that intensional languages be reduced to them (&sect;67). Of course,
the mere claim that the language of science can be extensional still
proves troublesome enough, given that in such a language a distinction
between laws and accidentally true universal propositions cannot be
drawn (the notion of a counterfactual conditional, needed to
distinguish the former, is an intensional one). Even so, this opening
of Carnap&rsquo;s towards intensionalism already at the height of his
syntacticism&mdash;to say nothing of his explicit intensionalism in
<em>Meaning and Necessity</em> (1947)&mdash;seems enough to thwart
Quine&rsquo;s second complaint in &ldquo;Two Dogmas&rdquo;. Carnap did
not share Quine&rsquo;s extensionalist agenda, so the need to break
out of the circle of intensional notions once these were clearly
defined in his formal languages did not apply. That theirs were in
fact different empiricist research programmes was insufficiently
stressed, it would appear, by Quine and Quinean critics of Carnap (as
noted pointedly by Stein 1992; cf. Ricketts 1982, 2003, Creath 1991,
2004, Richardson 1997, Carus 2010).</p>

<p>
To sustain his critique, Quine had to revive his and Tarski&rsquo;s
early doubts about Carnap&rsquo;s methodological apparatus and dig
even deeper. (Tarski also shared Quine&rsquo;s misgivings about
analyticity when they discussed these issues with Carnap at Harvard;
see Mancosu 2005, Frost-Arnold 2013.) Their scepticism found its
target in Carnap&rsquo;s ingenious measures in <em>Logical Syntax</em>
taken to preserve the thesis that mathematics is analytic from the
ravages of G&ouml;del&rsquo;s incompleteness theorems. G&ouml;del
proved that every formal system strong enough to represent number
theory contains a formula that is true but neither itself or its
negation is provable in that system; such formulae&mdash;known since
as G&ouml;del sentences&mdash;are provable in a still stronger system
which, however, also contains a formula of its own that is true but
not provable in it (and neither is its negation). Commonly,
G&ouml;del&rsquo;s proof is taken to have undermined the thesis of the
analyticity of arithmetic. Carnap responded by stating that arithmetic
demands an infinite sequence of ever richer languages and by declaring
analytic statements to be provable by non-finite reasoning (1934/37:
&sect;60a-d. For discussions of this challenge and Carnap&rsquo;s
response, see Friedman 1988, 1999a, 2009, Goldfarb &amp; Ricketts
1992, Richardson 1994, Awodey &amp; Carus 2003, 2004). Carnap&rsquo;s
move looked like fitting the bill on purely technical grounds, but it
is questionable whether such reasoning may still count as syntactic.
Nowadays, it is computational effectiveness that is taken to
distinguish purely formal from non-formal, material reasoning about
something. Carnap&rsquo;s move highlights the tension within
<em>Logical Syntax</em> between formal and crypto-semantic reasoning:
that the rigid syntacticism officially advertised there was at the
same time undermined as its failings were being
compensated&mdash;illegitimately so by official standards, e.g., by
considering translatability a syntactic notion&mdash;points ahead to
his acceptance of semantics in 1935, only one year after the
publication of <em>Logical Syntax</em> and contrary to his
disparagement of the notion of synthetic truth there. (For a
discussion of these moves by Carnap, see Coffa 1976, Ricketts 1996,
Goldfarb 1997, Creath 1996, 1999.) It is no criticism that
Carnap&rsquo;s reconstruction of arithmetic was not standard logicism,
but that Carnap unduly stretched the idea of formal reasoning is. Was
it saved by his shift to semantics?</p>

<p>
Tarski (1936) granted the language-relativity of the reconstructed
notion of analyticity in <em>Logical Syntax</em>. He also did not
object that Carnap&rsquo;s procedure of circumventing the problem
which the G&ouml;del sentences presented to the thesis of the
analyticity of arithmetic was illegitimate. Tarski rather questioned
whether there were &ldquo;objective reasons&rdquo; for the sharp
distinction between logical and non-logical terms and he pointed out
that Carnap&rsquo;s distinction between the logical and the empirical
was not a hard and fast one. Since noting the absence of a sharp
distinction and arguing that no distinction can be drawn in principle
are two quite different reactions, however, Tarski&rsquo;s point on
its own does not fully support the Quinean critique. Quine&rsquo;s
conclusion (1940: &sect;60) that the notion of logical truth itself is
&ldquo;informal&rdquo; rather reflects the moral that he drew from
Tarski&rsquo;s observation. It appears that what motivated him (after
a nominalistic interlude in the 1940s) to develop his naturalistic
alternative to Carnap&rsquo;s conception of philosophy was his
considered rejection of Carnap&rsquo;s accommodation of the thesis
that arithmetic is analytic to G&ouml;del&rsquo;s result.</p>

<p>
Different strands of Quine&rsquo;s criticism of the analytic/synthetic
distinction must thus be distinguished. While some of Quine&rsquo;s
criticisms in &ldquo;Two Dogmas&rdquo; do not undermine all forms of
the distinction that were defended in the Vienna
Circle&mdash;Carnap&rsquo;s reconstructions of the notion of
analyticity did not express unconditionally necessary and unrevisable
propositions&mdash;others gain in plausibility even against Carnap
once it is recognized that the deepest ground of contestation lies
elsewhere: not in the notion of analyticity widely understood but in
that of logical truth narrowly understood. Read in this way, Quine can
be seen to argue that the notion of L-consequence as explication of
analytic truth&mdash;as opposed to P-consequence as non-analytic, mere
framework entailments&mdash;traded not only on the idea of
non-finitary notions of proof but also on a distinction of logical
from descriptive expressions that itself was suspect. Saunders
MacLane&rsquo;s review (1938) of Carnap&rsquo;s <em>Logical
Syntax</em> had focussed on this and diagnosed its failure to give a
formally correct definition of logical terms (namely in &sect;50; see
Awodey 2007, 2012). This failure was not repaired by Carnap in his
semantical systems either, as he frankly admitted (1942: 59). In
consequence, the class of logical terms is only enumerable with
regard to individual languages or frameworks. What Quine criticized
then was precisely the fact that Carnap could ground the distinction
between logical and non-logical terms no deeper than by that: was the
distinction of logical from empirical truth therefore not quite
arbitrary? Now as it happens, logical truth or validity was found to
be definable in model-theoretic terms (not available to Carnap in the
early 40s) as &ldquo;truth in all models&rdquo; by Carnap&rsquo;s
close collaborator at Princeton, John Kemeny (1956), which Carnap then
was happy to allude to (1963b: 979). It would seem therefore that
neither Mac Lane&rsquo;s or Quine&rsquo;s criticism of Carnap&rsquo;s
inability to define logical terms in full generality must count as
fatal (Creath 2017). Quine&rsquo;s related claim that talk of
semantical rules is meaningless may likewise be considered less than
decisive in light of the fact that, as Carnap noted (1990: 430) that
no general language-independent definition can be given of extensional
truth either (but see Ebbs 2023).</p>

<p>
Quine&rsquo;s various arguments against the distinction between
logical and empirical truth in (1963) have also been found to beg the
question against Carnap and his way of conceiving of philosophy (see
Creath 2003). But setting aside Quine&rsquo;s objection does not
relieve us of specifying still more precisely just what Carnap thought
he was doing when he employed the distinction between analytic and
synthetic propositions. To be sure, in (1955) he gave broadly
behavioural criteria for when meaning ascriptions could be deemed
accepted in linguistic practice, but he also noted that this was not a
general requirement for the acceptability of explicatory discourse. It
bears stressing again that explications did not seek to model natural
language concepts in their tension-filled vividness, but to make
proposals for future use and to extract and systematize certain
aspects for constructive purposes. Thus Carnap clarified (1963b:
&sect;32) that he regarded the distinction between analytic and
synthetic statements&mdash;just like the distinction between
descriptive or factual and prescriptive or evaluative
statements&mdash;not as descriptive of natural language practices, but
as a constructive tool for logico-linguistic analysis and theory
construction. It is difficult to overstress the significance of this
stance of Carnap&rsquo;s for the evaluation of his version of the
philosophical project of the Vienna Circle. Carnap&rsquo;s
understanding of philosophy has been aptly described as the
&ldquo;science of possibilities&rdquo; (Mormann 2000). Perhaps most
notably, his conception of the relative a priori also finds
application in history of science (see
 <a href="#VieCirHis">section 3.7</a>
 below).</p>

<p>
As Carnap understood the analytic/synthetic distinction, it was a
distinction drawn by a logician to enable greater theoretical
systematicity in the reconstructive understanding of a given symbol
system, typically a fragment of a historically developed one. That
fully determinative objective criteria of what to regard as a logical
and what as a non-logical term cannot be assumed to be pre-given does
not then in and of itself invalidate the use of that distinction by
Carnap. On the contrary, it has been convincingly argued that Carnap
himself did not hold to a notion of what is a factual and what is a
formal expression or statement that was independent of the
specification of the language in question (Ricketts 1994). The
ultimate ungroundedness of his basic semantic explicatory categories,
this suggests instead, was a fact that his own theories fully
recognized and consciously exploited. (Somewhat analogously, that we
cannot define science independently of the practice of scientists of
&ldquo;our culture&rdquo; was admitted by Neurath 1932a, Carnap 1932d
and Hempel 1935, much to the exasperation of Zilsel 1932 and Schlick
1935a.) It remained open for Carnap then to declare his notion of
analyticity to be only operationally defined for constructed languages
and to let that notion be judged entirely in terms of its utility for
meta-theoretical reflection. Just on that account, however, a last
hurdle remains: finding a suitable criterion of significance for
theoretical terms that allows the distinction between analytic and
synthetic statements to be drawn in the non-observational, theoretical
languages of science. (This was a problem ever since the
non-eliminative reducibility of disposition terms had been accepted
and one that still held for Carnap&rsquo;s 1956b criterion; see
 <a href="#CarLatMeaCriProRam">section 3.5</a>
 below). Only if that can be done, it may be argued, can Carnap claim
his formalist explicationist project to emerge unscathed from the
criticisms of both Tarski and Quine.</p>

<p>
None of the above considerations should lead one to deny, however,
that one can find understandings of the term &ldquo;analytic&rdquo; by
members of the Vienna Circle (like Schlick) that do fall victim to the
criticisms of Quine more easily. Nor should one discount the fact that
Carnap&rsquo;s logic of science emerges as wilfully ill-equipped to
deal with the problems that exercise the traditional metaphysics or
epistemologies that deal in analyticities. (Of course, unlike his
detractors, Carnap considered this to be a merit of his approach.)
Lastly, it must be noted that Carnap&rsquo;s intensionalist logic of
science holds out the promise of practical utility only for the price
of a pragmatic story that remains to be told. Of what nature are the
practical considerations and decisions that, as Carnap so freely
conceded (1950a), are called for when choosing logico-linguistic
frameworks? (Such conventional choices do not respond to truth or
falsity, but instead to whatever is taken to measure convenience.)
That Carnap rightly may have considered such pragmatic questions
beyond his own specific brief as a logician of science does not
obviate the need for an answer to the question itself. (Carus 2007
argues that in this broadly pragmatic dimension lies the very point of
Carnap&rsquo;s explicationism.) On this issue, too, it would have been
helpful if there had been more collaboration with Neurath and Frank,
who were sympathetic to Carnap&rsquo;s explication of analyticity but
did not refer to it much in their own, more practice-oriented
investigations (see
 <a href="#StaCriSigPoiProExp">section 3.6</a>
 below).</p>

<h3 id="RedFouTwoCriParReb">3.3 Reductionism and Foundationalism: Two Criticisms Partly Rebutted</h3>

<p>
Opposition to foundationalism is often motivated by opposition to the
reductionism which it presupposes. Two forms of reductionism must be
distinguished, phenomenalist and physicalist reductionism.
Phenomenalism holds statements to be cognitively significant if they
can be reduced to statements about one&rsquo;s experience, be it outer
(senses) or inner (introspection). Physicalism holds statements to be
cognitively significant if they can be reduced (or, in a liberalised
version, evidentially related) to statements about physical states of
affairs. The Vienna Circle has been charged with both types of
reductionism. On the one hand, its philosophy is remembered mostly in
terms of the phenomenalism of the <em>Aufbau</em>, neglecting that
already there the possibility of adopting a physicalist basis for a
conceptual genealogy was indicated. On the other hand, the forms of
physicalism that were favored already in the early 1930s by some
leading members (Neurath 1931a, 1931b, Carnap 1932b, 1932c) seemed to
threaten the elimination of the intentional idiom. Thus one must not
only ask about the reductionism in the <em>Aufbau</em> but also
consider just how reductivist in intent the physicalism was meant to
be. Moreover, we must ask for the point of all the seeming
reductionism: was it to place scientific knowledge on a secure
foundation?</p>

<p>
Considerations can begin with an early critique that has given rise in
some quarters to a sharp distinction between Viennese logical
positivism and German logical empiricism, with the former accused of
reductionism and the latter praised for its anti-reductionism, a
distinction which discounts the changing nature and variety of Vienna
Circle doctrines. Reichenbach&rsquo;s defense of empiricism (1938)
turned on the replacement of the criterion of strict verifiability
with one demanding only that the degree of probability of meaningful
statements be determinable. This involved opposition also to demands
for the eliminative reduction of non-observational to observational
statements: both the methodological phenomenalism of the
<em>Aufbau</em> and reductive physicalism were viewed as untenable and
a correspondentist realism was advanced in their stead. Now it is true
that of the members of the Vienna Circle only Feigl ever showed
sympathies for scientific realism, but it is false that all opposition
to it in the Circle depended on the naive semantics of early
verificationism. (That even the <em>Aufbau</em> did not require strict
verification is argued in Creath 1982 and, as we saw in
 <a href="#VerCriMetClaPer">section 3.1</a>
 above, by 1935 physicalist reductionism was abandoned too.) Again, of
course, some Vienna Circle positions were liable to
Reichenbach&rsquo;s criticism.</p>

<p>
Another misunderstanding to guard against is that the Vienna
Circle&rsquo;s ongoing concern with &ldquo;foundational issues&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;foundations of science&rdquo; amount to
foundationalism. (In the Vienna Circle&rsquo;s days, foundationalism
had it that the basic items of knowledge upon which all others
depended were non-inferentially justified, concerned phenomenal states
of affairs and were infallible; nowadays, foundationalists drop
phenomenalism and infallibility.) Already the manifesto sought to make
clear the Circle&rsquo;s opposition when it claimed that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the work of &lsquo;philosophic&rsquo; or &lsquo;foundational&rsquo;
investigations remains important in accord with the scientific world
conception. For the logical clarification of scientific concepts,
statements and methods liberates one from inhibiting prejudices.
Logical and epistemological analysis does not wish to set barriers to
scientific enquiry; on the contrary, analysis provides science with as
complete a range of formal possibilities as is possible, from which to
select what best fits each empirical finding (example: non-Euclidean
geometries and the theory of relativity). (Carnap, Hahn, &amp; Neurath
1929 [1973: 316])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This passage can be read as an early articulation of the project of a
critical-constructivist meta-theory of science that abjures a special
authority of its own beyond that stemming from the application of the
methods of the empirical and formal sciences to science itself, but
instead remains open to what the actual practice of these sciences
demands. That Carnap later called his non-eliminative definitions of
disposition terms &ldquo;reduction sentences&rdquo; indicates that it
was enough for him to provide a basis for the applicability of these
terms by merely sufficient but not necessary conditions. Likewise,
Carnap&rsquo;s later proposal to conceive of theoretical terms as
defined by implicit definition in a non-interpreted language, only
selected terms of which were linked via non-eliminative reductive
chain to the observational language (see
 <a href="#SciTheTheTerProRea">section 3.4</a>
 below), suggests that what concerned him primarily was the capture of
indicator relations to sustain in principle testability of statements
containing the terms in question. This is best understood as an
attempt to preserve the empirical applicability of languages
constructed for high-level theory, but not as reductivism with regard
to some foundational given.</p>

<p>
So can Vienna Circle philosophy be absolved of foundationalism? As
noted, it is the <em>Aufbau</em> (and echoes of it in the manifesto)
that invites one version of this charge, but one must distinguish
between the strategy of reductionism and the ambition of
foundationalism. Concerning the <em>Aufbau</em> it has been argued
convincingly that its strategy of reconstructing empirical knowledge
from the perspective of methodological solipsism (phenomenalism
without its ontological commitments and some of its epistemological
ambitions) was owed not to foundationalist aims but to the ease by
which this perspective seemed to allow the demonstration of the
interlocking and structural nature of our system of empirical
concepts, a system that exhibited unity and afforded objectivity,
which was Carnap&rsquo;s main concern. (See Friedman&rsquo;s
path-breaking 1987 and 1992, and Richardson 1990, 1998, Pincock 2002,
2005. For the wide variety of influences on the <em>Aufbau</em> more
generally, see Damb&ouml;ck 2016.) That the <em>Aufbau</em> fails when
it is read as a foundationalist project, as it was by Quine (1951a)
who pointed out that no eliminative definition of the relation
&lsquo;is at&rsquo; was provided (required for locating objects of
consciousness in physical space) and that further failures of
reduction were detected by Richardson (1998: Ch.3), may give
additional grounds for questioning the <em>Aufbau&rsquo;s</em>
supposed foundationalism.</p>

<p>
Yet it is hard to deny categorically that Carnap ever harbored
foundationalist ambitions. Not only did Carnap himself, albeit in
retrospect, once locate his <em>Aufbau</em> very close to
foundationalism (1963a: 57), more indicative is a passage outlining
his epistemological ideas in (1930: &sect;8) that led Uebel (2007:
Ch.6) to claim that around 1929/30 Carnap was motivated by
foundationalist concerns and reinterpreted the <em>Aufbau</em> along
these lines. (It was around the same time that Wittgenstein
entertained a psychologistic reinterpretation of his own
<em>Tractatus</em> that was reported back to the Circle by Waismann
and also then that he, as noted above, bewitched the Circle with
strict verificationism.) However, this brief aberration of
Carnap&rsquo;s must not be taken to tell against the persuasiveness of
the new reading of the <em>Aufbau</em> as concerned with structural
objectivity or indeed against the overriding importance of the
epistemologies developed from 1930 onwards on the physicalist wing of
the Circle. For to correct Carnap&rsquo;s aberration was the task that
Neurath then shouldered in the Circle&rsquo;s protocol-sentence debate
about the content, form and status of the evidence statements of
science.</p>

<p>
Interestingly, it was yet another failure of reduction that appears to
have prompted Carnap to abandon methodological solipsism for use in
his reconstructions of the language of science (though not the logical
investigation of phenomenal languages for their own sake, as noted in
his 1961a). Throughout 1931 and much of 1932 Carnap defended his
approach even though Neurath (1931b, 1932a) argued that such a type of
rational reconstruction traded on objectionable counterfactual
presuppositions (methodological solipsism did not provide a correct
description of the reasoning involved in cognitive commerce with the
world around us). Only in &ldquo;On Protocol Sentences&rdquo; (which
first applied the Principle of Tolerance without much fanfare before
it was officially introduced in <em>Logical Syntax</em>) Carnap
conceded that it was more &ldquo;convenient&rdquo; to reconstruct the
language of science on a physicalistic than a phenomenalist basis, but
allowed for both (1932e). A few years later in &ldquo;Testability and
Meaning&rdquo;, however, Carnap concluded that &ldquo;a language about
conscious events as non-spatial events &hellip; is a purely subjective
one, suitable for soliloquy only&rdquo; and from then on abandoned the
methodologically solipsist approach for practical purposes (1936/37:
10; compare 1963b: 869). Evidently, with dispositional predicates
uneliminable in favor of observational ones and a
&ldquo;re-translation&rdquo; of theoretical discourse into
pre-theoretical terms no longer possible (1936/37: 464), the
additional effort it would take to &ldquo;reduce&rdquo; theoretical
assertions beyond the physicalist &ldquo;thing-language&rdquo; still
further to the phenomenal level was not only inconvenient but
pointless. The new logic of science must not be as &ldquo;entangled
with psychological questions&rdquo; (1934c [1937]: &sect;72) as his
earlier epistemology still had been, Carnap now resolved.</p>

<p>
As Carnap also testified, &ldquo;Neurath had always rejected the
alleged rock bottom of knowledge&rdquo; (1963a: 57). A good example of
his position is provided by his complex conception of the form of
protocol statements (1932b). Neurath proposed to explicate the concept
of observational evidence in terms that expressly reflected debts to
empirical assumptions which called for theoretical elaboration in
turn. For unlike the logician of science Carnap, who left it to
psychology and brain science to determine more precisely what the
class observational predicates were that could feature in protocol
statements (1936/37: 454), the empirically oriented meta-theoretician
of science Neurath was concerned to encompass and comprehend the
practical complexities of reliance on scientific testimony: the
different clauses (embeddings) of his proposed protocol statements
stand for conditions on the acceptance of such testimony (see Uebel
2009, Bentley 2022). In addition, the details of Neurath&rsquo;s
theory of protocol statements also make clear that his understanding
of physicalism did not entail the eliminative reduction of the
intentional idiom but, like Carnap (1932c), merely sought its
integration into empiricist discourse.</p>

<p>
Given these different emphases of their respective physicalisms,
mention must also be made of the significant differences between
Carnap&rsquo;s and Neurath&rsquo;s conceptions of unified science:
where the formalist Carnap once preferred a hierarchical ordering of
finitely axiomatized theoretical languages that allowed at least
partial cross-language definitions and derivations&mdash;these
requirements were liberalized in (1936b), (1936/37) (1938)&mdash;the
pragmatist Neurath demanded from the start only the
interconnectability of predictions made in the different individual
sciences (1935a), (1936a), (1944). (Meteorology, botany and sociology
must be combinable to predict the consequences of a forest fire, say,
even though each may have its own autonomous theoretical vocabulary.)
Here too it must be remembered that, unlike Carnap, Neurath only
rarely addressed issues in the formal logic of science but mainly
concerned himself with the partly contextually fixed pragmatics of
science. (One exception is his 1935b, a coda to his previous
contributions to the socialist calculation debate with Ludwig von
Mises and others.) At times the priorities set by Neurath for the
pragmatics of science seemed to conflict with those of Carnap&rsquo;s
logic of science. (These tensions were palpable in the grand
publication project undertaken by Carnap and Neurath in conjunction
with Morris, the <em>International Encyclopedia of Unified
Science</em>; see Reisch 2003.) That said, however, note that
Carnap&rsquo;s initially more hierarchical approach to the unity of
science also does not support the attribution of foundationalist
ambitions. (The ontological micro-reductions introduced by Oppenheim
&amp; Putnam 1958 were never part of his conception.)</p>

<p>
But for a brief lapse around 1929/30 and perhaps in some pre-Vienna
years, then, Carnap fully represents the position of Vienna Circle
anti-foundationalism. In this he joined Neurath whose long-standing
anti-foundationalism is evident from his famous simile, first used in
1913, that likens scientists to sailors who have to repair their boat
without ever being able to pull into dry dock (1932). Their positions
contrasted at least <em>prima facie</em> with that of Schlick (1934)
who explicitly defended the idea of foundations in the Circle&rsquo;s
protocol-sentence debate. Even Schlick conceded, however, that all
scientific statements were fallible ones, so his position on
foundationalism was by no means the traditional one. The point of his
&ldquo;foundations&rdquo; remained less than wholly clear and
different interpretation of it have been put forward (e.g., Oberdan
1998, Uebel 1996, 2020b). (On the protocol sentence debate as a whole,
which included not only the discussions between Carnap and Neurath but
also debates between the physicalists and Schlick and other occasional
participants, see the differently centered accounts of Uebel 1992,
2007, Oberdan 1993, Cirera 1990 [1994].) While all in the Circle thus
recognized as futile the attempt to restore certainty to scientific
knowledge claims, not all members embraced positions that rejected
foundationalism <em>tout court</em>. Clearly, however, attributing
foundationalist ambitions to the Circle as a whole constitutes a total
misunderstanding of its internal dynamics and historical development,
if it does not bespeak wilfull ignorance. At most, a vaguely
foundationalist faction around Schlick can be distinguished from the
so-called left wing whose members pioneered anti-foundationalism with
regard to both the empirical and formal sciences.</p>

<h3 id="SciTheTheTerProRea">3.4 Scientific Theories, Theoretical Terms and the Problem of Realism</h3>

<p>
Yet even if it be conceded that the members of the Vienna Circle did
not harbour undue reductionist-foundationalist ambitions, the question
remains open whether they were able to deal with the complexities of
scientific theory building.</p>

<p>
Here the prominent role of Schlick must be mentioned, whose
<em>General Theory of Knowledge</em> was the first publication by
(future) members of the Vienna Circle to follow Hilbert&rsquo;s work
on the axiomatic method and introduce the so-called two-languages
model of scientific theories (1918, enhanced in second edition 1925:
&sect;11). According to Schlick, scientific theories comprised an
observational part formulated with observational predicates as
customarily interpreted, in which observations and experiential laws
were stated, and a theoretical part which consisted of theoretical
laws (axioms) the terms of which were merely implicitly defined,
namely, in terms of the roles they played in the laws in which they
figured. Both parts were connected in virtue of a not further
specified correlation between some of their terms. (A similar
precursor was the idea contained in a remark by Frank [1910] pointing
out the applicability of Hilbert&rsquo;s method of implicit definition
to the reconstruction empirical scientific theories as conceived by
the French conventionalists Rey and Duhem.) In the second half of the
1920s this model, involving separate conceptual systems, was
temporarily set aside in favor of a more streamlined conception of
scientific theories along the reductive lines as suggested by the
<em>Aufbau,</em> but its broad outline was returned to by Carnap when
it was noted that not even the so-called reduction sentences provided
a bridge to all theoretical terms (1939: &sect;24); further elaborated
it became standard in logical empiricism.</p>

<p>
According to Carnap (see esp. his 1956b: 47, also Feigl 1970),
scientific theories are formalised as axiomatized sets of sentences in
first- or higher-order logic which contain, besides logical and
mathematical terms, descriptive terms referring to entities,
properties and processes in the theory&rsquo;s intended domain. Some
selected theoretical terms are connected to observational terms that
refer to observable entities, properties and processes via so-called
correspondence rules which contain both types of terms. (Reduction
sentences and their chains count as correspondence rules.) Only the
observational terms are given a full semantic interpretation. The
theoretical terms are defined only implicitly through their
inferential role by the axioms of the theory; the correspondence rules
link the theory as a whole to observable reality, but not every
theoretical term individually. A theory is viewed as an uninterpreted
calculus that receives only a &ldquo;partial interpretation&rdquo; by
the correspondence rules which guarantee its applicability through
observable consequences but do not generally assign references to its
terms.</p>

<p>
Note that this conception of scientific theories was put forward as a
rational reconstruction, not a description of scientific practice;
nevertheless, as &ldquo;the received view&rdquo; (Putnam 1962) it
received much criticism both as formally inadequate and
methodologically misguided. (See Suppe 1977 for a systematic overview
of the standard formal charges against logical empiricism&rsquo;s
misleadingly labelled &ldquo;syntactic view&rdquo; of theories,
Mormann 2007a for a partial defense, and Lutz 2012, 2014 for the
refutation of common misunderstandings and arguments against the
supposed superiority of the equally mislabelled &ldquo;semantic
view&rdquo; of theories.) Nowadays philosophers prefer a more
practice-oriented view that focusses less on the linguistic structure
of theories but on their &ldquo;models&rdquo; which themselves can be understood
in a great variety of ways (see, e.g., Morgan &amp; Morrison 1999 or
Frigg 2022).</p>

<p>
Even granted the partial interpretation model in outline (more
criticism in
 <a href="#VieCirHis">section 3.7</a>),
 questions arise both concerning its observational base as well as its
theoretical superstructure. We already discussed one aspect of the
former, the issue of protocols, in the previous section, so
let&rsquo;s turn to the latter topic. Talk of correspondence rules
only masks the problem that is raised by theoretical terms. One of the
pressing issues concerns their so-called surplus meaning over and
above their observational consequences. This issue is closely related
to the problem of scientific realism: are there truth-evaluable
matters of fact for scientific theories beyond their empirical,
observational adequacy? Even though the moniker
&ldquo;neo-positivism&rdquo; would seem to prescribe an easy answer as
to what the Vienna Circle&rsquo;s position was, it must be noted that
just as there is no consensus discernible today there was none in the
Circle beyond certain basics that left the matter undecided.</p>

<p>
All in the Vienna Circle followed Carnap&rsquo;s judgement in
<em>Pseudoproblems of Philosophy</em> (1928b) and Schlick&rsquo;s
contention in his response to Planck&rsquo;s renewal of anti-Machian
polemics (1932) that questions like that of the reality of the
external world were not well-formed ones but only constituted
pseudo-questions. While this left the observables of empirical reality
clearly in place, theoretical entities remained problematical: were
they really only computational fictions introduced for the ease with
which they allowed complex predictive reasoning, as Frank (1932) held?
This hardly seems to do justice to the role of theoretical terms over
and above their computational utility: theories employing them seem to
tell us about non-observable features of the world. This indeed was
Feigl&rsquo;s complaint (1950) in what must count as the first of very
few forays into &ldquo;semantical realism&rdquo; (scientific realism
by another word) by a former member of the Vienna Circle&mdash;and one
that was quickly opposed by Frank&rsquo;s instrumentalist rejoinder
(1950). Carnap sought to remain aloof on this as on other ontological
questions. So while in the heyday of the Vienna Circle itself the
issue had not yet come into clear focus, by mid-century one could
distinguish amongst its surviving members both realists (Feigl) and
anti-realists (Frank) as well as ontological deflationists
(Carnap).</p>

<p>
Carnap&rsquo;s general recipe for avoiding undue commitments (while
pursuing his investigations of various language forms, including the
intensional ones Quine frowned upon) was given in terms of the
distinction between so-called internal and external questions (1950a).
Internal questions and their answers presuppose the adoption of a
logico-linguistic framework. Given one such, we can state the facts in
accordance with what that framework allows us to say. Given any of the
languages of arithmetic, say, we can state as particular arithmetical
facts whatever we can prove in them; to say that there are numbers is
to express the fact that numbers are a recognized category of objects
in that framework (irrespective of whether they are logically derived
from a still more basic category). Whether certain special types of
numbers exist depends on the expressive power of the framework at hand
and on whether the relevant facts can be proven. Analogous
considerations apply to the existence of physical things (the external
world) given the logico-linguistic frameworks of everyday discourse
and empirical science. (The near-tautologous nature of these
categorical claims in Carnap&rsquo;s hands echoes his earlier
diagnosis of metaphysical claims as pseudo-statements; see also 1934c
[1937]: Part V.A.) Unlike such internal questions, however, external
questions ask whether numbers or electrons &ldquo;really exist&rdquo;
irrespective of any framework. External questions were ruled out as
illegitimate and meaningless for in the absence of a framework there
is no way of making determinate sense of them. The only way in which
sense could be given to them was to read them as pragmatic questions
concerned with the utility of talk about numbers or electrons, of
adopting certain frameworks. Meaningful existence claims respond to
internal questions and must be regarded as mediated by the available
conceptual tools of inquiry. Logicians of science are in no position
to double-guess scientists by appeals to superior intuition. (Needless
to say, Quine 1951b opposed the internal/external distinction as much
as his 1951a opposed the analytic/synthetic distinction.)</p>

<p>
Matters came to a head with the discovery of a proof (see Craig 1956)
that the theoretical terms of a scientific theory are dispensable in
the sense of it being possible to devise a functionally equivalent
theory that does not make use of them. Did this not rob theoretical
terms of their distinctive role and so support instrumentalism? The
negative answer was twofold. As regards defending their utility,
Carnap (1963b: &sect;24) agreed with Hempel (1958) that in practice
theoretical terms were indispensable in facilitating inductive
relations between observational data. As regards the defense of their
cognitive legitimacy, Carnap held that this demanded determining what
he called their &ldquo;experiential import&rdquo;, namely, determining
what specifically their empirical significance consisted in. It was
for this purpose that Carnap came to employ Ramsey&rsquo;s method of
regimenting theoretical terms. Nowadays this so-called ramseyfication
is often discussed as a means for expressing a position of
&ldquo;structural realism&rdquo;, a position midway between
fully-blown scientific realism and anti-realism and so sometimes
thought to be of interest to Carnap. Carnap&rsquo;s own concern with
ramseyfication throws into relief not only the question of the
viability of one of the Vienna Circle&rsquo;s most forward-looking
stances in the debate about theoretical terms&mdash;the intention to
avoid both realism and anti-realism&mdash;but also several other
issues that bear on the question of which, if any, forms of Vienna
Circle philosophy remain viable.</p>

<h3 id="CarLatMeaCriProRam">3.5 Carnap&rsquo;s Later Meaning Criterion and the Problem of Ramseyfication</h3>

<p>
Note that the issue of realism vis-&agrave;-vis theoretical terms is
closely related to two other issues central to the development of
Vienna Circle philosophy: Carnap&rsquo;s further attempts to develop a
criterion of empiricist significance for the terms of the theoretical
languages of science and his attempts to defend the distinction
between synthetic and analytic statements with regard to such
theoretical languages.</p>

<p>
In 1956 Carnap introduced a new criterion of meaningfulness
specifically for theoretical terms (1956b). This criterion was
explicitly theory-relative. Roughly, Carnap first defined the concept
of the &ldquo;relative significance&rdquo; of a theoretical term. A
term is relatively significant if and only if there exists a statement
in the theoretical language that contains it as the only non-logical
term and from which, in conjunction with another theoretical statement
and the sets of theoretical postulates and correspondence rules, an
observational statement is derivable that is not derivable from that
other theoretical statement and the sets of theoretical postulates and
correspondence rules alone. Then Carnap defined the
&ldquo;significance&rdquo; of a theoretical term by its belonging to a
sequence of such terms such that each is relatively significant to the
class of those terms that precede it in the sequence. Now those
theoretical statements were legitimate and cognitively significant
that were well-formed and whose descriptive constants were significant
the sense just specified. It is clear that by the stepwise
introduction of theoretical terms as specified, Carnap sought to avoid
the deleterious situations that rendered Ayer&rsquo;s criterion false
(and his own in 1928b). Nevertheless, this proposal too was subjected
to criticism (e.g., Rozeboom 1960; D. Kaplan 1975a). A common
impression amongst philosophers appears to be that this criterion
failed as well, but this judgement is by no means universally shared
(for the majority view see Glymour 1980, for a contrary assessment see
Sarkar 2001). Thus it has been argued that subject to some further
refinements, Carnap&rsquo;s proposal can be made to work (see for
discussion Creath 1976, Justus 2014, 2022, Lutz 2017)&mdash;as long as
the distinction between observational and theoretical terms can be
sustained. (In light of the objections to the latter distinction one
wants to add: or by a dichotomy of terms functionally equivalent to
it.)</p>

<p>
Carnap&rsquo;s own position on his 1956 criterion appears somewhat
ambiguous. While he is reported to have accepted one set of criticisms
(D. Kaplan 1975b), he also asserted even after they had been put to
him that he thought his criterion remained adequate (1963b:
&sect;24b). Yet Carnap there also advised investigation of whether
still another, then entirely new approach to theoretical terms that he
was developing would allow for an improved criterion of significance
for them. Still, when Carnap offered &ldquo;the Ramsey method&rdquo;
as a method of characterizing the &ldquo;empirical meaning of
theoretical terms&rdquo; it was not their empirical meaningfulness as
such but the specific empirical import of theoretical terms that he
investigated (1966: Ch. 26). What prompted him to undertake his
investigations of ramseyfications was not dissatisfaction with his
1956 proposal as a criterion of significance for theoretical terms,
but the fact that it still proved impossible with this model to draw
the distinction between synthetic and analytic statements in the
theoretical language. The reason for this was that the postulates for
the theoretical language also specify factual relations between
phenomena that fall under the concepts that are implicitly defined by
them. (As noted, a similar problem already had plagued Carnap&rsquo;s
analyses of disposition terms ever since he allowed for
non-eliminative reduction chains.)</p>

<p>
Carnap&rsquo;s attempt to address this problem by ramseyfication was
published in several places from 1958 onwards. (See Carnap 1958,
1963b: &sect;24C-D and the popular exposition 1966: Chs. 26 and 28;
compare Ramsey 1929 and see Psillos 1999: Ch.3. This proposal and a
variant of it (1961b) were both presented in his 1959 Santa Barbara
lecture (published in Psillos 2000a); as it happened, Kaplan presented
his criticism (1975a) of Carnap&rsquo;s 1956 criterion at the same
conference.) With ramseyfication Carnap adverted again to entire
theories as the unit of assessment. Ramseyfication consists in the
replacement of the theoretical terms of a finitely axiomatized theory
by bound higher-order variables. This involves combining all the
theoretical postulates which define theoretical terms (call this
conjunction <em>T</em>) and correspondence rules of a theory which
link some of these theoretical terms with observational ones (call
this <em>C</em>) in one long sentence (call this <em>TC</em>) and then
replacing all the theoretical predicates that occur in it by bound
higher-order variables (call this <em><sup>R</sup>TC</em>). This is
the so-called Ramsey-sentence of the entire theory; in it no
theoretical terms appear, but it possesses the same explanatory and
predictive power as the original theory: it has the same observational
consequences. However, Carnap stressed that the Ramsey sentence cannot
be said to be expressed in a &ldquo;simple&rdquo; but only an
&ldquo;extended&rdquo; observational language, for due to its
higher-order quantificational apparatus it includes &ldquo;an advanced
complicated logic embracing virtually the whole of mathematics&rdquo;
(1966, [1996, 253]).</p>

<p>
To distinguish between analytic and synthetic statements in the
theoretical language Carnap made the following proposal. Let the
Ramsey sentence of the conjunction of all theoretical postulates and
the conjunction of all correspondence rules of that theory be
considered as expressing the entire factual, synthetic content of a
scientific theory and its terms. By contrast, the statement
<em><sup>R</sup>TC</em> &rarr; <em>TC</em> expressed the purely
analytic component of the theory, its &ldquo;A-postulate&rdquo; (or
so-called Carnap sentence). This</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A-postulate states that if entities exist (referred to by the
existential quantifiers of the Ramsey sentence) that are of a kind
bound together by all the relations expressed in the theoretical
postulates of the theory and that are related to observational
entities by all the relations specified by the correspondence
postulates of the theory, then the theory itself is true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Or differently put, the A-postulate &ldquo;says only that if the world
is this way, then the theoretical terms must be understood as
satisfying the theory&rdquo; (1966 [1996: 271]). With
<em><sup>R</sup>TC</em> &rarr; <em>TC</em> expressing a meaning
postulate Carnap claimed to have separated the analytic and synthetic
components of a scientific theory.</p>

<p>
Carnap&rsquo;s adoption of the Ramsey method met mainly with criticism
(Psillos 1999: ch.3, 2000b; Demopoulos 2003, 2017), even though
ramseyfications continue to be discussed as a method of characterizing
theoretical terms in a realist vein (albeit with conditions not yet
introduced by Carnap, as in Lewis 1970, Papineau 1996). With
Carnap&rsquo;s ramseyfications, however, we do not get the answer that
what exists is the structure that the ramseyfication at hand
identifies. Given the absence of a clause requiring unique
realizability, ramseyfications counseled modesty: the structure that
is identified remains indeterminate to just that degree to which
theoretical terms remain incompletely interpreted (Carnap 1961b). To
this we must add that for Carnap ramseyfications of theoretical terms
could support only internal existence claims: he explicitly reaffirmed
his confidence in the distinction between internal and external
question to defuse the realism/anti-realism issue (1966 [1996: 256]).
This strongly suggests that with these proposals Carnap did not intend
to deviate from his deflationist approach to ontology.</p>

<p>
What must be considered, however, is that Carnap&rsquo;s proposal to
reconstruct the contribution of theoretical terms by ramseyfication
falls foul of arguments deriving from M.H.A. Newman&rsquo;s objection
to Russell&rsquo;s structuralism in <em>Analysis of Matter</em> (see
Demopoulos &amp; Friedman 1985). This objection says that once they
are empirically adequate, ramseyfied theories are trivially true,
given the nature of their reconstruction of original theories. Russell
held that &ldquo;nothing but the structure of the external world is
known&rdquo;. But if nothing is known about the generating relation
that produces the structure, then the claim that there exists such a
structure is vacuous, Newman claimed. &ldquo;Any collection of things
can be organised so as to have the structure <em>W</em>, provided
there are the right number of them.&rdquo; (Newman 1928: 144) To see
how this so-called cardinality constraint applies to ramseyfications
of theories, note that in Carnap&rsquo;s hands, the non-observational
part of reconstructed theories, their theoretical entities, were
represented by &ldquo;purely logico-mathematical entities, e.g.
natural numbers, classes of such, classes of classes, etc.&rdquo; For
him the Ramsey sentence asserted that &ldquo;observable events in the
world are such that there are numbers, classes of such, etc., which
are correlated with events in a prescribed way and which have among
themselves certain relations&rdquo;, this being &ldquo;clearly a
factual statement about the world&rdquo; (Carnap 1963b: 963). Carnap
here had mathematical physics in mind where space-time points are
represented by quadruples of real numbers and physical properties like
electrical charge-density or mass-density are represented as functions
of such quadruples of real numbers.</p>

<p>
The problem that arises from this for Carnap is not the failure to
single out the intended interpretation of the theory: as noted, Carnap
clearly thought it an advantage of the method that it remained
suitably indeterminate. The problem is rather that, subject to its
empirical adequacy, the truth conditions of the Ramsey-sentences are
fulfilled trivially on logico-mathematical grounds alone. As he
stated, Ramsey-sentences demand that there be a structure of entities
that is correlated with observable events in the way described. Yet
given the amount of mathematics that went into the ramseyfied
theory&mdash;&ldquo;virtually the whole of
mathematics&rdquo;&mdash;some such structure as demanded by the
Ramsey-sentence is bound to be found among those entities presupposed
by its representational apparatus. (Here the cardinality constraint is
no constraint at all.) That any theory is trivially true for purely
formal reasons (as long as it is empirically adequate) therefore is
held against Carnap&rsquo;s proposal to use Ramsey sentences as
reconstructions of the synthetic content of the theoretical part of
empirical scientific theories. Given that with ramseyfications
&ldquo;the truth of physical theory reduces to the truth of its
observational consequences&rdquo; (Demopoulos &amp; Friedman 1985:
635), this is a problem for Carnap&rsquo;s project on its own terms:
any surplus empirical meaning of theoretical terms that Carnap sought
to capture simply evaporates (Demopoulos 2003).</p>

<p>
This result casts its shadow over Carnap&rsquo;s last treatment of
theoretical terms and threatens further consequences. If the
reconstruction of empirical theories by ramseyfication in
Carnap&rsquo;s fashion is unacceptable and no justice has been done to
the import of theoretical terms, then one must ask whether the
analytic components of a theoretical language have been correctly
identified. If they have not, then the meta-theoretical utility of the
synthetic/analytic distinction is once again be called into question.
One is lead to wonder whether Carnap would not be well advised to
return to his 1956 position, which allowed for a criterion of
empirical significance for theoretical terms but not for the full
analytic/synthetic distinction to be sustained with regard to the
theoretical language. (According to Carnap&rsquo;s fall-back position
before he hit upon ramseyfication, it was thought possible to
distinguish narrow logical truth from factual truth in the theoretical
language: 1966: Ch. 28.) Yet it is difficult to silence the suspicion
that an analytic/synthetic distinction that applies only to
observational languages is not what the debate between Carnap and
Quine was all about. Attempts have thus been undertaken to provide
interpretations of Carnap&rsquo;s ramseyfications to contain or
mitigate the effects of the Newman objection (Friedman 2008, 2011;
Uebel 2011b; Creath 2012a). What has become clear, in any case, is
that much is at stake for the standard logical empiricist model of
scientific theories (see also end of
 <a href="#VieCirHis">section 3.7</a>
 below).</p>

<h3 id="StaCriSigPoiProExp">3.6 The Status of the Criterion of Significance and the Point of the Project of Explication</h3>

<p>
We are now in a position to return to a final criticism of the search
for a criterion of empiricist significance. Much has been made of the
very status of the criterion itself (however it may be put in the
end): was it empirically testable? It is common to claim that it is
not and therefore to consign it to insignificance in turn (e.g.,
Putnam 1981a, 1981b). The question arises whether this is to overlook
the fact that the criterion of significance was put forward not as an
empirical claim but as a meta-theoretical proposal for how to delimit
empiricist languages from non-empiricist ones (see Carnap 1936/37:
&sect;27). Again, pursuing this line of inquiry is not to deny that
the meaning criterion may have been understood by some members of the
Circle in such a way that it became liable to charges of
self-refutation. (In that case the criterion would share its
contradictory status with Wittgenstein&rsquo;s Tractarian
&ldquo;elucidations&rdquo; to which it may have been likened. The
legitimacy of these elucidations was at issue already in the debates
that divided the Circle in the early 1930s; see, e.g., Neurath 1931a)
What will be considered here is primarily the view of Carnap, who in
the spirit of the Principle of Tolerance put his philosophical theses
in the form of &ldquo;proposals&rdquo; for alternative language forms,
but how the pragmatist alternative fares will also be considered.
Finally, we will consider where this does leave neopositivist
anti-metaphysics.</p>

<p>
For Carnap, the empiricist criterion of significance was an analytic
principle, but in a very special sense. As a convention, the criterion
had the standing of an analytic statement, but it was not a formally
specifiable framework principle of the language <em>L<sub>n</sub></em>
to which it pertained. Properly formulated, it was a semantic
principle concerning <em>L<sub>n</sub></em> that was statable only in
its meta-language <em>L</em><sub><em>n</em>+1</sub>. To argue that the
criterion itself is meaningless because it has no standing in
<em>L<sub>n</sub></em> is to commit a category mistake, for
meta-linguistic assertions need not have counterparts in their object
languages (Goldfarb 1997, Creath 2004, Richardson 2004). Nor would it
be correct to claim that the criterion hides circular reasoning,
allegedly because its rejection of the meaningless depends on an
unquestioned notion of experiential fact as self-explanatory (when
such fact is still to be constituted). Importantly, Carnap&rsquo;s
language constructor does not start with fixed notions of what is
empirical (rather than formal) or what is given (rather than assumed
or inferred), but from the beginning allows a plurality of
perspectives on these distinctions (Ricketts 1994). Carnap&rsquo;s
empiricist criterion of significance is precisely this: an
explication, a proposal for how empiricists may wish to speak. It is
not an explanation of how meaning arises from what is not meaningful
in itself. Unlike theorists who wish to explain how meaning itself is
constituted, explicationists can remain untroubled by the regress of
formal semantics with Tarskian strictures. For them, the lack of
formal closure (the incompleteness of arithmetic and the
inapplicability of the truth predicate to its own language) only
betokens the fact that our very own home languages cannot ever be
fully explicated.</p>

<p>
It may be thought that such considerations have become pointless,
given the troubles that attempts to provide a formal criterion of
significance ran into, but revisions of Carnap&rsquo;s 1956 criterion
for constructed languages remain under discussion (as we saw).
Moreover, there also remains the informal, pragmatic approach that can
be applied even more widely. Thus it is not without importance to see
that pragmatic principles delineating empirical significance (like
Mach&rsquo;s or Quine&rsquo;s Peircean insight) are not ruled out from
the start either. The reason for this is different however. For
pragmatists, the anti-metaphysical demarcation criterion is not
strictly speaking a meaning criterion. The pragmatic criterion of
significance is expressly epistemic, not semantic: it speaks of
relevance with regard to an established cognitive practice, not
in-principle truth-evaluability. This criterion is most easily
expressed as a conditional norm, alongside other methodological
maxims. (If you want your reasoning to be responsible to evidence,
then avoid statements that experience can neither confirm or
disconfirm, however indirectly.) So the suggestion that the criterion
of empirical significance can be regarded as a proposal for how to
treat the language of science cannot be brushed aside but for the
persistent neglect of the philosophical projects of Carnap or the
non-formalist left Vienna Circle.</p>

<p>
Still, some readers may wonder whether in the course of responding to
the various counter-criticisms, the Vienna Circle&rsquo;s position has
not shifted considerably. This indeed is true: the attempt to show
metaphysics strictly meaningless once and for all did not succeed. For
even if revisions of Carnap&rsquo;s 1956 criterion and the pragmatic
approach work, they do not achieve that: Carnap&rsquo;s criterion only
works for constructed languages and the pragmatic one only works case
by case. But it can be argued that while this debilitates the Vienna
Circle&rsquo;s most notorious claim (if understood without
qualifications), it does not debilitate their entire program. That
was, we recall, to defend Enlightenment reason and to counter the
abuse of possibly empty but certainly ill-understood deep-sounding
language in science and in public life. Their program was, to put it
somewhat anachronistically, to promote epistemic empowerment. This
program would have been helped by an across-the-board criterion to
show metaphysics meaningless, but it can also proceed in its
absence.</p>

<p>
But now the suspicion may be that if all that is meant to be excluded
is speculative reason without due regard to empirical and
logico-linguistic evidence, the program&rsquo;s success appears too
easy. Few contemporary philosophers would confess to such reckless
practices. Still, even the rejection of speculative reason is by no
means uncontroversial, as shown by the unresolved status of the appeal
to intuitions that characterizes much of contemporary analytical
metaphysics and epistemology. Moreover, much depends on what&rsquo;s
considered to be &ldquo;due regard&rdquo;: is merely bad science
&ldquo;metaphysics&rdquo;? Or only appeals to the supernatural? And
what about <em>de re</em> necessities? The promotion of
anti-metaphysics may be applauded in principle as an exercise in
intellectual hygiene, the objection goes, but in practice it excludes
either too much or too little: it either cripples our understanding of
theoretical science or normalizes away the Vienna Circle&rsquo;s most
notorious claim.</p>

<p>
In response it is helpful to consider the conception of metaphysics
that can be seen to be motivating much of the Circle&rsquo;s ethical
non-cognitivism. What did Carnap (1935) and Neurath (1931c) dismiss
when they dismissed normative ethics as metaphysical and cognitively
meaningless? One may concede that due to the brusque way in which they
put their broadly Humean point, they opened themselves up to
significant criticism, but it is very important to see also what they
did not do. Most notably, they did not dismiss as meaningless all
concern with how to live. Conditional prescriptions remained
straight-forwardly truth-evaluable in instrumental terms and so
cognitively meaningful. In addition, their own active engagement for
Enlightenment values in public life showed that they took these
matters very seriously themselves. (In fact, their engagement as
public intellectuals compares strikingly with that of most
contemporary philosophers of science.) But neither did they fall
victim to the naturalistic fallacy nor were they simply inconsistent.
In the determination of basic values they rather saw acts of personal
self-definition, but, characteristically, Carnap showed a more
individualistic and Neurath a more collectively oriented approach to
the matter. What needs to be borne in mind, then, is the meaning that
they attached to the epithet &ldquo;metaphysical&rdquo; in this and
other areas: the arrogation of unique and fully determined objective
insight into matters beyond scientific reason. It was in the ambition
of providing such unconditional prescriptions that they saw
philosophical ethics being the heir of theology. (Compare Carnap 1935
and 1963b: &sect;32 and Neurath 1932a and 1944: &sect;19.) Needless to
say, it remains contentious to claim those types of philosophical
ethics to be cognitively meaningless that seek to derive determinate
sets of codes from some indisputable principle or other. But the
ongoing discussion of non-cognitivism and its persistent defense in
analytical ethics as &ldquo;expressivism&rdquo; suggest that,
understood as outlined, the Circle&rsquo;s non-cognitivism was by no
means absurd or contradictory.</p>

<p>
It may be noted here that a newly discovered fragment of
Carnap&rsquo;s writing (2017) has given fresh impetus to explorations
of the model of ethical reasoning in terms of pure and applied
optatives that Carnap outlined (1963b: &sect;32) in response to A.
Kaplan&rsquo;s criticism (1963) of his earlier position. (Remember
that conditional value statements had never been ruled cognitively
meaningless.) What emerges is that Carnap was prepared to integrate
ethical desiderata among non-ethical ones within the network of means
and ends that decision theory as a normative theory of rational action
seeks to systematize and regiment. Moral reasoning was assimilated to
practical instrumental reasoning and no longer suffered from a
wholesale deficit of significance&mdash;albeit at the cost of not
being able to exclude certain values as basic and consider the
respective pure optatives inadmissible on the ground their being
beyond the pale morally (see Carus 2017). Carnap may reasonably
respond here that as a theorist of science he is not required to
account for normative ethics beyond providing a framework for
understanding its undeniable role in a generic theory of human
behavior. What was rightly objected against his earlier position was
that it made such understanding impossible.</p>

<p>
Whatever the details, their non-cognitivism supports the idea that the
left wing&rsquo;s anti-metaphysics was primarily deflationist. They
opposed all claims to have a categorically deeper insight into reality
than either empirical or formal science, such that philosophy would
stand in judgement of these sciences as to their reality content or
that mere science would stand in need of philosophical
interpretations. (Concerned with practical problems, they likewise
opposed philosophical claims to stand above the contestations of mere
mortals.) Importantly, such deflationism need not remain general and
vague, but can be given precise content. For instance, it has been
argued (Carus 1999) that Carnap was correct to understand
Tarski&rsquo;s theory of truth not as a traditional correspondence
theory such that truth consisted in some kind of agreement of
statements or judgements and facts or the world where the latter make
true the former. In Carnap&rsquo;s unchanged opposition to the
classical correspondence theory of truth in turn lies not only the
continuity between his own syntactic and semantic phases, but also the
key to his and the entire left Vienna Circle&rsquo;s understanding of
their anti-metaphysical campaign. (On various occasions in the early
30s, Hahn, Frank and Neurath opposed correspondence truth very
explicitly, while, in later years, Neurath resisted Tarskian semantics
precisely because he wrongly suspected it of resurrecting
correspondentism and Frank continued to castigate correspondentism
whenever required. On this tangled issue, see Mormann 1999, Uebel
2004, Mancosu 2008, Carus 2019.)</p>

<p>
This suggests that a hard core of Viennese anti-metaphysics survives
the criticism and subsequent qualifications of early claims made for
their criteria of empirical significance, and retains sufficient
philosophical teeth to remain of contemporary interest. The
metaphysics which the left wing attacked, besides everyday
supernaturalism and the supra-scientific essentialism of old, was the
correspondence conception of truth and associated realist conceptions
of knowledge. These notions were deemed attackable directly on
epistemological grounds, without any diversion through the theory of
meaning: how could such correspondences or likenesses ever be
established? As Neurath liked to put it (1930), we cannot step outside
of our thinking to see whether a correspondence obtains between what
we think and how the world is. (Against defenses of the correspondence
theory by arguments from analogy it would be argued that the analogy
is overextended.) Against the counter that this is merely an epistemic
argument that does not touch the ontological issue Neurath is likely
to have argued that doing without an epistemic account is a recipe for
uncontrollable metaphysics.</p>

<p>
Importantly, the left wing&rsquo;s deflationary anti-metaphysics was
accompanied by a distinctively constructivist attitude. Here one must
hasten to add, of course, that what was constructed were not the
objects of first-order discourse (tables, chairs, electrons and black
holes) but concepts, be they concepts associated with technical terms
for observables, theoretical terms or terms needed for reflection
about the cognitive enterprise of science (ideas like evidence and its
degrees and presuppositions). As meta-theorists of science they
developed explications: different types of explications were
envisaged, ranging from analytic definitions giving necessary and
sufficient conditions in formal languages all the way to pragmatic,
exemplar-based criterial delimitations of the central applications of
contested concepts or practices. Two branches of the Circle&rsquo;s
constructivist tendency can thus be distinguished: Carnap&rsquo;s
rational reconstructions and formalist explications and
Neurath&rsquo;s and Frank&rsquo;s empirically informed and
practice-oriented reconceptualizations. The difference between these
two approaches can be understood as a division of labor between the
tasks of exploring logico-linguistic possibilities of conceptual
reconstruction and considering the efficacy of particular scientific
practices. In principle, the constructivist tendency in Vienna Circle
philosophy was able to embrace both (compare Carnap 1934/37: &sect;72
and Neurath 1936b). However, in its own day, this two-track approach
remained incompletely realized as philosophical relations between
Carnap and Neurath soured over disputes stemming from mutual
misunderstandings. Frank&rsquo;s final paper (1963) was a terse
reminder that the logic of science was not the sole successor or
replacement of traditional philosophy and Carnap&rsquo;s response
(1963b: &sect;3) again acknowledged the compatibility in principle of
his logic of science and what Frank called the &ldquo;pragmatics of
science&rdquo; (1957).</p>

<p>
Considering the Vienna Circle as a whole in the light of this reading
of its anti-metaphysical philosophy, we find the most striking
division within it yet. Unlike Carnap and the left wing, Schlick had
little problem with a correspondence theory of truth once it was
cleansed of psychologistic and intuitive accretions and centered on
the idea of unique coordination of statement and fact. In this lay the
strongest sense of continuity between his pre-Vienna Circle
<em>General Theory of Knowledge</em> (1918/25) and his post-Tractarian
epistemology (1935a, 1935b). (Schlick also showed little enthusiasm
for the constructivist tendencies which already the manifesto of 1929
had celebrated.) Allowing for some simplification, it must be noted
that Schlick&rsquo;s attack on metaphysics (which gradually weakened
anyway) presupposed a non-constructivist reading of the criterion of
significance. Whether his conception can escape the charge
self-refutation must be left open here.</p>

<h3 id="VieCirHis">3.7 The Vienna Circle and History</h3>

<p>
Much confusion exists concerning the Vienna Circle and history, that
is, concerning the Vienna Circle&rsquo;s attitude towards the history
of philosophy and science and its own place in that history. As more
has been learnt about the history of the Vienna Circle
itself&mdash;the development and variety of its doctrines as well as
its own prehistory as a philosophical forum&mdash;this matter can be
addressed more adequately.</p>

<p>
As the unnamed villain of the opening sentences of Kuhn&rsquo;s
influential <em>Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em> (1962),
logical empiricism is often accused of lacking historical
consciousness and any sense of the embedding of philosophy and science
in the wider culture of the day. Again it can hardly be denied that
much logical empiricist philosophy, especially after World War II, was
ahistorical in outlook and asocial in its orientation.
Reichenbach&rsquo;s distinction (1938) between the contexts of
discovery and justification&mdash;which echoed distinctions made since
Kant (Hoyningen-Huene 1987) and was already observed under a different
name by Carnap in the <em>Aufbau</em>&mdash;was often employed to
shield philosophy not only from contact with the sciences as practiced
but also culture at large. But this was not the case for the Vienna
Circle generally. On the one hand, unlike Reichenbach, who drew a
sharp break between traditional philosophy and the new philosophy of
logical empiricism in his popular <em>The Rise of Scientific
Philosophy</em> (1951), Schlick was very much concerned to stress the
remaining continuities with traditional philosophy and its cultural
mission in his last paper (1937). On the other hand, on the left wing
of the Circle scientific meta-theory was opened to the empirical
sciences. To be sure, Carnap for his own part was happy to withdraw to
the &ldquo;icy slopes&rdquo; of the logic of science and showed no
research interest of his own in the history of science or philosophy,
let alone its social history. By way of the division of labor he left
it to Neurath and Frank to pursue the historical and practice-related
sociological questions that the pure logic of science had to leave
unaddressed. (See, e.g., Neurath&rsquo;s studies of the history of
optics [1915, 1916], Frank&rsquo;s homage to Mach [1917], his
pedagogical papers in 1949b and his concern with the practice of
theory acceptance and change in 1956; cf. Uebel 2000 and Nemeth 2007.)
Moreover, it must be noted that Neurath himself all along had planned
there to be a volume on the history of science in the
<em>International Encyclopedia of Unified Science</em>, a volume that
in the end became Kuhn&rsquo;s <em>Structure</em>. Its publication in
this series is often regarded as supremely ironical, given how
Kuhn&rsquo;s book is commonly read. But this is not only to overlook
that the surviving editors of that series, Carnap and Morris, were
happy to accept the manuscript, but also that Carnap found himself in
positive agreement with Kuhn (Reisch 1991, Irzik &amp; Grunberg 1995;
cf. Friedman 2001). Finally, one look at the 1929 manifesto shows that
its authors were very aware of and promoted the links between their
philosophy of science and the socio-political and cultural issues of
the day.</p>

<p>
Turning to the historical influences on the Vienna Circle itself, the
scholarship of recent decades has unearthed a much greater variety
than was previously noted. Scientifically, the strongest influences
have long been recognized to have been the physicists Helmholtz, Mach
and Boltzmann (to which Maxwell must now be added: see Cat 2021), the
mathematicians Hilbert and Klein and the logicians Frege and Russell;
amongst contemporaries, Einstein was revered above all others. The
Circle&rsquo;s philosophical influences extend far beyond that of the
British empiricists (especially Hume), to include the French
conventionalists Henri Poincar&eacute;, Pierre Duhem and Abel Rey,
American pragmatists like James and, in German-language philosophy,
the Neo-Kantianism of both the Heidelberg and the Marburg variety,
even the early phenomenology of Husserl as well as the Austrian
tradition of Bolzano&rsquo;s logic and the Brentano school. (See Frank
1949a for the influence of the French conventionalists; for the
importance of Neo-Kantianism for Carnap, see Friedman 1987, 1992,
Sauer 1989, Richardson 1998, Mormann 2007b; for Neo-Kantianism in
Schlick, see Coffa 1991: Ch. 9 and Gower 2000; for the significance of
Husserl for Carnap, see Sarkar 2003, Ryckman 2007, Carus 2016,
Damb&ouml;ck 2018; for the influence of and sympathies for pragmatism
see Frank 1949a and Uebel 2015b; the Bolzano-Brentano connection is
explored in Haller 1986.) It is against this very wide background of
influences that the seminal force must be assessed that their
contemporary Wittgenstein exerted. The literature on the relation
between Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle tends to suffer from an
over-simplified conception of the latter, and an over-estimation of
their commitment to the Tractarian program. (See Stern 2007 for an
attempt by a Wittgenstein scholar to redress the balance and also
contributions in Stadler 2023.) Needless to say, different wings of
the Circle show these influences to different degrees. German
Neo-Kantianism was important for Schlick and particularly so for
Carnap, whereas Austrian naturalist-pragmatist influences were
particularly strong on Hahn, Frank and Neurath. Frege was of great
importance for Carnap, less so for Hahn who looked to Russell. Most
importantly, by no means all members of the Vienna Circle sought to
emulate Wittgenstein&mdash;thus the division between the faction
around Schlick and the left wing (see Uebel 2017).</p>

<p>
While these findings leave numerous questions open, they nevertheless
refute the standard picture of Vienna Circle philosophy which confuses
A.J. Ayer&rsquo;s <em>Language, Truth and Logic</em> with the real
thing. Ayer offered a version of British empiricism (Berkeley&rsquo;s
epistemic phenomenalism updated with Russellian logic) and paid no
attention, for instance, to the Circle&rsquo;s overarching concern
with establishing the objectivity claim of science. Ayer&rsquo;s
remark in the preface to his later anthology <em>Logical
Positivism</em> that his own <em>Language, Truth and Logic</em>
&ldquo;did something to popularize what may be called the classical
position of the Vienna Circle&rdquo; (1959b, 8) is highly misleading
therefore. What he called &ldquo;the classical position&rdquo; was at
best a partial characterisation of the starting position of
some&mdash;by no means all&mdash;of its members, a position which by
1932 the left wing as a whole rejected and even Schlick had no reason
to endorse any longer (see also contributions in Tuboly 2021).</p>

<p>
All that said by way of embedding the Vienna Circle&rsquo;s philosophy
in its time, one must also ask whether its members understood their
own position correctly. Here one issue in particular has become
increasingly prominent and raises questions that are of importance for
philosophy of science still today. That is whether, after all, logical
empiricism did have the resources to understand correctly the then
paradigm modern science, the general theory of relativity. According
to the standard logical empiricist story (Schlick 1915, 1917, 1921,
1922), their theory conclusively refuted the Kantian conception of the
synthetic <em>a priori</em>: Euclidean geometry was not only one
geometry amongst many, it also was not the one that characterized
empirical reality. With one of its most prominent exemplars refuted,
the synthetic <em>a priori</em> was deemed overthrown altogether. As
noted, Schlick convinced the young Reichenbach to drop his residually
Kantian talk of constitutive principles and speak of conventions
instead. Likewise Schlick (1921, 1922) rejected Cassirer&rsquo;s
Neo-Kantian efforts (see his 1921, developing themes from his 1910) to
make do with a merely relative <em>a priori</em> in helping along
scientific self-reflection. Even though much later, and on the
independent grounds of quantum physics, Frank attested to the
increased proximity of his and Cassirer&rsquo;s understanding of
scientific theories (1938), Schlick&rsquo;s earlier dismissal of his
efforts remains notable.</p>

<p>
Most controversial is how the issue of general relativity as a
touchstone for competing philosophies of science was framed: having
dismissed Kant&rsquo;s own synthetic <em>a priori</em> for its
mistaken apodicity, no time was spared for discussion of its then
contemporary development in Neo-Kantianism as a merely relative but
still constitutive <em>a priori</em>. Now in the philosophy of
physics, this omission&mdash;committed both by Schlick and
Reichenbach&mdash;has come back to haunt logical empiricists with
considerable vengeance. Thus it has been shown that the
Schlick-Reichenbach reading of general relativity as embodying the
standard logical empiricist model of scientific theories, with high
theory linked to its observational strata by purely conventional
coordinative definitions, is deeply mistaken in representing the local
metric of space-time not to be empirically but conventionally
determined as in special relativity (Ryckman 1992) and it has been
argued that it is instead only the tradition of transcendental
idealism that possesses the resources to understand the achievements
of mathematical physics (Ryckman 2005; cf. Friedman 2001). It is
tempting to speak of the return of the repressed Neo-Kantian
opposition. But it is tempting too to note that Schlick&rsquo;s and
Reichenbach&rsquo;s mistake was already corrected quietly and without
fanfare by Carnap (see the example in his 1934c [1937]: &sect;50). So
that mistake does not seem to have been inevitable and inherent in
logical empiricist theorizing about science as such. Still further
interpretive perspectives on the matter must be noted that in turn
reflect varying assessments of Einstein&rsquo;s position and who of
the Circle is taken as point of reference. For instance, different
criticisms of the Circle&rsquo;s standard reading of Einstein&rsquo;s
relation to Mach (and Einstein&rsquo;s self-understanding) are
presented by DiSalle (2006: Ch.4), while Howard (who also long
criticized the Schlick-Reichenbach reading: 1994) elaborates and
defends Frank&rsquo;s distinctive, namely holistic Duhemian reading of
Einstein&rsquo;s general theory of relativity and his endorsement of
Einstein&rsquo;s refusal to privilege man-made <em>a prioris</em> as
natural in (2021).</p>

<p>
A different charge of failing the history of science arises from
Demopoulos&rsquo;s challenge to the partial interpretation view of
scientific theories universally adopted in logical empiricism (2017,
2022, Ch.1). Importantly, this challenge does not proceed, as some
previous ones have, from the impossibility of drawing a sharp
distinction between the observational and the theoretical, a point
Carnap had long admitted, or other failures previously alleged.
Rather, the challenge is that the partial interpretation view falsely
supposes that the process of testing scientific hypotheses must only
advert to theoretically uncontaminated facts and so results in
misunderstanding the empirical import of theoretical claims (as in the
Newman problem). Instead, Demopoulos&rsquo;s argument appeals to the
methodology of theory-mediated measurement rediscovered from Newton.
This methodology extends the evidential base for theoretical claims
about unobservables beyond the prediction of observation statements.
It does so by taking account of how hitherto undetermined parameters
which apply to these theoretical entities are measured, namely by
exploiting diverse but concordant theoretically predicted functional
relationships with yet other parameters for which experimental
techniques of determining their values exist (see Smith 2002). This
methodology breaks with regarding the theoretical language as an
essentially uninterpreted calculus and is shown at work in Jean
Perrin&rsquo;s argument for the molecular hypothesis and J.J.
Thomson&rsquo;s for the corpuscular nature of cathode rays. Notably
Demopoulos&rsquo;s critique of the partial interpretation view is
intended to support the existential claims of theories without
supporting the so-called semantic view of theories or scientific
realism in general.</p>

<p>
With the Vienna Circle thus challenged on account of their historical
self-understanding, we must also mention one important contribution
from its ranks to the study of the history of science and its
philosophy itself, the adoption of the non-apodictic but nevertheless
constitutive <em>a priori</em>. Friedman (2001) drew attention to the
fact that Carnap&rsquo;s notion of the relative <em>a priori</em>
coheres well with certain aspects of Kuhn&rsquo;s notion of paradigms
or disciplinary matrixes that change in the course of scientific
revolutions. The significance of this is not lessened by the fact that
Kuhn was not aware of the parallel. Carnap was open to the idea,
indeed the fact, that reason has a history, even though as a logician
he did not explore it much. Nor was he alone with this recognition.
Neurath&rsquo;s remark &ldquo;That reason changes its <em>a
prioris</em> is a matter for the history of the sciences, it is not a
matter for the logic of science&rdquo; (1935c [1981: 657], trans. TU)
shows that even Vienna Circle naturalists were prepared to accept the
relative <em>a priori</em>, free as it was of the metaphysical baggage
of the old <em>a priori</em> and its associated Platonism, pertaining
instead to the changing presuppositions of scientific conceptions of
the world that were held at various points in history by
investigators. That self-styled philosophical revolutionaries like
Carnap and Neurath held such a view suggests once more that they and
their colleagues in the Vienna Circle (Frank cannot be far behind) be
credited with a reflexive awareness that still is not as common even
among philosophers as it should be. (For explorations of the
implications of this partial convergence of Carnap and Kuhn for the
history of the Vienna Circle and philosophy in general, see Richardson
2002, Creath 2010, 2024.)</p>

<h2 id="ConRem">4. Concluding Remarks</h2>

<p>
The results of the discussion in
 <a href="#SelDocTheCri">section 3</a>
 can be briefly summarised. To start with, the dominant popular
picture of the Vienna Circle as a monolithic group of simple-minded
verificationists who pursued a blandly reductivist philosophy with
foundationalist ambitions is widely off the mark. Instead, the Vienna
Circle must be seen as a forum in which widely divergent ideas about
how empiricism can cope with modern empirical and formal science were
discussed. While by no means all of the philosophical initiatives
started by members of the Vienna Circle have borne fruit, it is
neither the case that all of them have remained fruitless. Nor is it
the case that everything once distinctive of Vienna Circle philosophy
has to be discarded.</p>

<p>
Consider verificationism. Once the focus on the language of science is
clarified it hardly matters that the idea to show metaphysics
once-and-for-all and across-the-board to be not false but
meaningless&mdash;arguably the most distinctive thesis associated with
the Vienna Circle&mdash;had to be abandoned, for two versions of
criterial verificationism elements remain to be pursued. On the one
hand, there is the search for a criterion of empirical significance in
terms of constructed, formal languages further along the lines opened
by Carnap with his theory-relative proposal of 1956 and its later
amendments. On the other hand&mdash;albeit at the cost of merging with
the pragmatist tradition and losing the apparent Viennese
distinctiveness&mdash;there is the option to reject claims made in
natural language that are of a type for which no exemplars of testing
exist. Properly formulated as proposals, neither the formalist nor the
pragmatist version of the criterion are threatened by
self-refutation.</p>

<p>
Consider analyticity. Here again, the traditional idea&mdash;sometimes
defended by some members&mdash;did show itself indefensible, but this
leaves Carnap&rsquo;s language-relative interpretation of analyticity
and the understanding of the <em>a priori</em> as framework-relative
to be explored. If Carnap&rsquo;s ramseyfications can be defended, an
analytic/synthetic distinction could be upheld also for the
theoretical languages of science, but the distinction between
framework principles and content continues to be drawable on a case by
case basis in any case. For pragmatists the inability to define
&ldquo;analytic&rdquo; and &ldquo;logical&rdquo; for all languages at
once is no deterrent as long as they can be for the languages under
investigation.</p>

<p>
Consider reductionism and foundationalism. While it cannot be denied
that various reductionist projects were undertaken by members of the
Vienna Circle early on and that not all members were epistemological
anti-foundationalists either from the start or at the end, it is
clearly false to paint all of them with reductivist and/or
foundationalist brushes. This is particularly true of the members of
the so-called left wing of the Circle who ended up with
anti-foundationalist and anti-reductionist positions (some involving
instrumentalism).</p>

<p>
Consider also, however, the challenges mentioned above to the
fundamental tenets of logical empiricism that remain issues of intense
discussion: challenges to its conception of the nature of empirical
theory and of what is distinctive about the formal sciences. That to
this day no agreement has been reached about how its proposals are to
be replaced shows the ongoing relevance and centrality of its work for
philosophy of science.</p>

<p>
On the centenary of the inception of the Vienna Circle as a discussion
group around Schlick it can be said that much of the variety of the
philosophies of its members has been recovered, but work is ongoing.
Whether the suggested qualifications and/or modifications count as
defeats of the original project depends at least in part on what
precisely is rejected when metaphysics is rejected and that in turn
depends on what the positive vision for philosophy consists in. Here
again one must differentiate. While some members ended with
considerably more sympathy for traditional philosophy than they
displayed in the Circle&rsquo;s heyday&mdash;and may thus be charged
with partial surrender&mdash;others stuck to their guns. For them,
what remained of philosophy stayed squarely in the deflationist vein
established by the linguistic turn. They offered explications of
contested concepts or practices that, they hoped, would prove useful.
Importantly, the explications given can be of two sorts: the formal
explications of the logic of science by means of exemplary fragments
of constructed languages, and the more informal explications of the
empirical theory of science given by spelling out how certain
theoretical desiderata can be attained more or less under practical
constraints. This has been designated as the bipartite metatheory
conception of scientific philosophy and ascribed to the left wing of
the Circle as an ideal unifying its diverse methodologies (Uebel 2007:
Ch.12, 2015a; Bentley 2023). Readers will note therefore that despite
his enormous contribution to the development of Vienna Circle
philosophy, it is not Schlick&rsquo;s version of it that appears to
this reviewer to be of continuing relevance to contemporary
philosophy&mdash;unlike, in their very different but not incompatible
ways, Carnap&rsquo;s and Neurath&rsquo;s and Frank&rsquo;s. This may
be taken as a partial endorsement of Hempel&rsquo;s 1991 judgement
(quoted in
 <a href="#IntRem">section 1</a>
 above), against which, however, Carnap has here been re-claimed for
the Neurathian wing.</p>

<p>
Recent work on Vienna Circle philosophies has inspired a notable
variety of approaches to the legacy they constitute (besides prompting
continuing excavations of other members&rsquo; non-standard variants).
There is Michael Friedman&rsquo;s extremely wide-ranging project
(2001, 2010, 2012) to use the shortcomings of Vienna Circle
philosophies as a springboard for developing a renewed Kantian
philosophy that also overcomes the failings of neo-Kantianism and
provides a philosophy-cum-history fit for our post-Kuhnian times. Then
there is Richardson&rsquo;s proposal (2008) to turn the ambition to
develop a scientific philosophy into a research programme for the
history of science, so as to reveal more clearly the real world
dynamics and limitations of philosophy as a scientific metatheory, and
to revitalize the idea of scientific philosophy itself (2024). And
there is Carus&rsquo;s suggestion (2007) that Carnap&rsquo;s
minimalist explicationism be placed in the service of a renewed
Enlightenment agenda (continuing the task of the &ldquo;scientific
world conception&rdquo;). This connects with the current
metaphilosophical interest in conceptual engineering, the relevance of
Carnap&rsquo;s work to which is becoming increasingly recognised
(Creath 1991, Justus 2012, Richardson 2013, Wagner 2012, Brun 2016,
Dutilh Novaes &amp; Reck 2017, Dutilh Novaes 2020, Lutz 2020). All
along, of course, Vienna Circle philosophies also continue to serve as
foils for alternative and self-consciously post-positivist programs,
fruitfully so when informed by the results of recent scholarship.</p>

<p>
It would appear then that despite continued resistance to recent
revisionist scholarship&mdash;a resistance that consists not so much
in contesting but in ignoring its results&mdash;the fortune of Vienna
Circle philosophy has turned again. Restored from the numerous
distortions of its teachings that accrued over generations of acolytes
and opponents, the Vienna Circle is being recognized again as a force
of considerable philosophical sophistication. Not only is it the case
that its members profoundly influenced the actual development of
analytical philosophy of science with conceptual initiatives that,
typically, were seen through to their bitter end. It is also the case
that some of its members offered proposals and suggested approaches
that were not taken up widely at the time (if at all), but that are
relevant again today. Much like its precursors Frege, Russell and
Wittgenstein, the conventionalists Poincar&eacute; and Duhem, the
pragmatists Peirce and Dewey&mdash;and like its contemporaries from
Reichenbach&rsquo;s Berlin Group and the Warsaw-Lvov school of logic
to the Neo-Kantian Cassirer&mdash;the Vienna Circle affords a valuable
vantage point on contemporary philosophy of empirical and formal
science.</p>

<h1>Bernard Mandeville</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Jun 3, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Bernard Mandeville (1670&ndash;1733), an Anglo-Dutch physician and
philosopher, achieved fame through his notorious work <em>The Fable of
the Bees: Or, Private Vices, Publick Benefits</em>. He is most
well-known for arguing that economic prosperity depends upon
harnessing individuals&rsquo; self-interested and even vicious
passions, an idea which outraged his contemporaries and has
subsequently led to him occupying an important place in the history of
economic thought. <em>The Fable of the Bees</em> is a far more
wide-ranging work, however, which offers incisive explorations of
human nature, the passions, and the origins of moral and social norms.
In addressing these topics, Mandeville made major contributions to the
history of moral and social philosophy, and was a significant
influence on many eighteenth-century philosophers, including David
Hume, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Adam Smith. More recently,
Mandeville&rsquo;s ideas on the gradual evolution of moral norms and
social institutions have been taken up by theorists of spontaneous
order, following F. A. Hayek.</p>

<h2 id="LifeWork">1. Life and Works</h2>

<p>
Born on 15 November 1670, in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, Bernard
Mandeville hailed from a respected family of Dutch physicians,
merchants, and political officials. He studied at Leiden University,
known for its scholarly contributions to Cartesian and experimental
philosophy. After earning degrees in philosophy and medicine,
specializing in the connection between digestive disorders and
psychology, Mandeville migrated to the British Isles, possibly due to
his family&rsquo;s involvement in the Costerman Riots of 1690 (Dekker
1992). In London, Mandeville worked as a physician from 1693, focusing
on nervous disorders. He died in Hackney in 1733. Despite the fame
that he had achieved by the end of his life, relatively little is
known about his views beyond those that appear in his published works,
due to the scarcity of personal correspondence or other available
archival materials. Indeed, even identifying Mandeville&rsquo;s
published works is not without its challenges, since many originally
appeared anonymously and, in some cases, his authorship was
established only in the early decades of the twentieth century (see
especially Kaye 1921; Anderson 1935).</p>

<p>
In 1705, Mandeville published <em>The Grumbling Hive: Or, Knaves
Turn&rsquo;d Honest,</em> a poem describing a wealthy bee community
that seeks to root out all vice from the hive, which serves as an
allegory illustrating the disastrous consequences that would follow
any successful attempt to impose a moral reformation on an opulent
nation like England. The poem challenged the prevalent &ldquo;public
spirit&rdquo; ideology associated with civic humanism at the turn of
the eighteenth century, ridiculing the notion that our benevolent or
virtuous qualities lie behind social order and prosperity. In addition
to the <em>Grumbling Hive</em>&rsquo;s doggerel couplets, poetry
featured prominently in Mandeville&rsquo;s early literary endeavors,
both in the form of translations and original verses, such as <em>The
Pamphleteers: A Satyr</em> (1703), <em>Aesop Dress&rsquo;d: Or a
Collection of Fables Writ in Familiar Verse</em> (1704), and
<em>Typhon; Or the Wars Between the Gods and Giants: A Burlesque
Poem</em> (1704). A little later in his career, Mandeville compiled a
collection entitled <em>Wishes to a Godson, with Other Miscellany
Poems</em> (1712).</p>

<p>
As his years in London progressed, Mandeville began to venture into
prose publishing. <em>The Virgin Unmask&rsquo;d</em> (1709) is one of
his boldest yet least well-known works. It comprises nine dialogues
between a young lady and her aunt, who discuss a range of topics from
the inequalities between the sexes to matters of political economy and
statecraft in European politics. Throughout his writings, Mandeville
would maintain a keen interest in the role of women in society and the
double standards they face in various aspects of life. This is a theme
that he continued to explore in his wide-ranging contributions to the
periodical <em>The Female Tatler</em>, consisting of thirty-two issues
published in 1709&ndash;1710, which were written in response to the
campaign for moral reform being advanced by Richard Steele in <em>The
Tatler</em>. In these contributions, Mandeville analyzed the standards
of female and male honor for the first time in print, along with many
other topics to which he would later return, such as dueling, the
social functions of pride and vanity, and the naturalistic origins of
civil society (see Goldsmith 1985: 35&ndash;46; Peltonen 2003:
263&ndash;302).</p>

<p>
<em>A Treatise of the Hypochondriack and Hysterick Passions</em>,
first published in 1711 and later in an expanded edition (with a
slightly different title) in 1730, brought Mandeville wider
recognition and remained a notable reference point amongst physicians
well into the late eighteenth century (Simonazzi 2016: 63&ndash;66).
It also facilitated Mandeville&rsquo;s entry into London&rsquo;s
medical circles, guided by the eminent physician and naturalist Sir
Hans Sloane. In the <em>Treatise</em>, Mandeville employs a dialogue
format to engage patients directly, highlighting the importance of
their active participation in therapy. He examines the relationship
between socioeconomic status and hypochondria, arguing that wealth,
with its attendant fears and desires, contributes to the loss of
animal spirits and psychosomatic ailments. The <em>Treatise</em>
addresses broader philosophical themes beyond its focus on medical
matters&mdash;while also offering some suggestive autobiographical
remarks&mdash;and is thus a key text for understanding how Mandeville
sought to combine a satirical and polemical approach with his wider
scientific and philosophical goals (Hilton 2010).</p>

<p>
In 1714, Mandeville republished <em>The Grumbling Hive</em> as part of
a larger work entitled <em>The Fable of the Bees: Or, Private Vices,
Publick Benefits</em>, with the subtitle announcing the idea for which
he is now most famous. The book contained a series of short essays, or
&ldquo;Remarks&rdquo;, which purport to explain some of the main ideas
from the original verse, along with an essay entitled &ldquo;An
Enquiry Into the Origin of Moral Virtue&rdquo;, where Mandeville
attributes the development of our ideas of virtue to skillful
politicians who harnessed pride and shame to promote socially
desirable behavior.</p>

<p>
Mandeville&rsquo;s next major work, <em>Free Thoughts on Religion, the
Church, and National Happiness</em> (1720; expanded 1729), delves into
theological matters and criticizes the role of the church in fostering
persecution and intolerance. In this work (and elsewhere) Mandeville
borrows extensively from Pierre Bayle, one of the great champions of
religious toleration in seventeenth-century Europe. Mandeville
advocates for a civil religion where the clergy would be salaried and
under the authority of the government, on the grounds that this would
promote tolerance and moderation. <em>Free Thoughts</em> remains a
somewhat puzzling work. It discusses political and religious history
in some depth, setting itself apart from Mandeville&rsquo;s
dialogue-style compositions by adopting a more serious and less
distinctive tone. Certain chapters were published independently in
Whig periodicals of the time, underscoring Mandeville&rsquo;s
intention to wield practical political influence. Indeed, Mandeville
published several political pamphlets throughout his literary career,
including <em>An Enquiry into the Causes of the Frequent Executions at
Tyburn</em> (1725), which initially graced the pages of a prominent
Whig periodical before being reprinted on other occasions in
eighteenth-century newspapers. Other pamphlets, such as <em>The
Mischiefs that ought Justly to be Apprehended from a
Whig-Government</em> (1714) and <em>A Modest Defence of Publick
Stews</em> (1724), have also been attributed to Mandeville.</p>

<p>
Mandeville&rsquo;s ideas generated increased controversy following the
publication of a revised edition of <em>The Fable of the Bees</em> in
1723, which included additional remarks and two new lengthy essays.
The first of these advances a scathing critique of the charity school
movement and provides a revealing insight into Mandeville&rsquo;s
views on the working poor, while the second attacks the philosophy of
Anthony Ashley Cooper, Third Earl of Shaftesbury, who is portrayed as
Mandeville&rsquo;s principal philosophical adversary. The 1723 edition
was presented by the Grand Jury of Middlesex as a work that promoted
irreligion and immorality. Mandeville defended himself against these
charges by publishing <em>A Vindication of the Book</em> in 1724,
which was appended to subsequent editions of the <em>Fable</em>.
During this period, his friend Lord Macclesfield&rsquo;s corruption
trial further contributed to the tumultuous atmosphere surrounding
Mandeville&rsquo;s reputation.</p>

<p>
In 1729, six years after the scandal over the <em>Fable</em> had
propelled him to fame, Mandeville published <em>The Fable of the Bees,
Part II</em>, which takes the form of six lengthy dialogues mainly
between the characters Horatio and Cleomenes. This work showcases
Mandeville&rsquo;s most developed analysis of human nature and
society, and, while few thinkers engaged with it explicitly, it
appears to have influenced important philosophical trends in European
thought, and especially in the Scottish Enlightenment. In his last
major work, <em>An Enquiry into the Origin of Honour, and the
Usefulness of Christianity in War</em> (1732), Mandeville resumes the
dialogues between Horatio and Cleomenes to explore the role of
self-liking in the development of honor codes, revealing how this
passion had been exploited by different political powers, such as the
Church of Rome. He argues that honor, though incompatible with virtue
and religion, served as a hierarchical principle and social tie that
was central to understanding the European politics of his day.</p>

<p>
In 1732, Mandeville also published <em>A Letter to Dion</em>, in
response to George Berkeley&rsquo;s criticisms of the <em>Fable</em>.
Mandeville protested that his critics had frequently misrepresented
his ideas and intentions, in part so that they could divert attention
from the ways in which the <em>Fable</em> exposed their own hypocrisy
and moral shortcomings (Tolonen 2022). To some extent, however,
Mandeville&rsquo;s paradoxical and satirical style invited criticism
and perhaps even misunderstanding. He did not write systematic
philosophical treatises, which has posed considerable obstacles for
both his contemporaries and later readers who have attempted to grasp
his overall philosophical stance. Nonetheless, and as we shall see,
his works are characterized by a sustained and serious attempt to
improve our understanding of a wide range of social and political
phenomena through an in-depth analysis of human nature.</p>

<h2 id="HumaNatu">2. Human Nature</h2>

<p>
Mandeville&rsquo;s account of human nature proved extremely
controversial in the eighteenth century. Some of his most provocative
ideas challenged widely held assumptions about what distinguishes
humans from other animals, and he was often taken to have followed in
the footsteps of another notorious philosopher, Thomas Hobbes, in
reducing all human behavior to some form of self-love. Yet, as David
Hume (1739&ndash;1740 [2000: 5]) famously remarked, Mandeville can
also be seen as part of a tradition of philosophers, following John
Locke, who played a pivotal role in putting &ldquo;the science of man
on a new footing&rdquo; by deriving general principles about human
nature from careful observation and experience.</p>

<p>
Mandeville outlines an approach along these lines in <em>A Treatise of
the Hypochondriack and Hysterick Passions</em>, where he claims that
human knowledge &ldquo;can only come <em>a posteriori</em>&rdquo; (TH
100). He disparages physicians who propound abstract systems based
upon reason alone, without seeking empirical support for their
speculations, and instead argues that the art of the physician is
grounded upon practical knowledge, which involves observing patterns
from one&rsquo;s accumulated experience and offering plausible
hypotheses that can explain the available evidence (TH, especially
61&ndash;63, 91). Mandeville sometimes presents his approach in
<em>The Fable of the Bees</em> in similar terms, claiming that even
when he offers speculative conjectures to account for obscure social
phenomena, his reasonings are nonetheless based on &ldquo;the plain
Observations which every body may make on Man&rdquo; (FB II, 128).</p>

<p>
Observing human nature accurately, however, is no easy task.
Mandeville suggests that many people go astray either by moralizing
about how we should behave, rather than focusing on how we really do
behave (FB I, 39), or by assuming that we possess certain qualities
that elevate us above other animals. The latter concern is especially
evident in Mandeville&rsquo;s changing views on whether humans possess
an immaterial soul (see Simonazzi 2008: 119&ndash;128). While studying
at the University of Leiden, Mandeville had written a dissertation
(<em>Disputatio Philosophica de Brutorum Operationibus</em> [1689];
translated in McKee 1991) endorsing the Cartesian view that non-human
animals are incapable of anything approaching human consciousness, yet
he would increasingly come to repudiate this position as he sought to
uncover the more animalistic aspects of human nature (Callanan 2015).
We are conscious of thinking ourselves, so if we assume that matter is
incapable of thought then it makes sense to conclude that we possess
an immaterial soul. Yet Mandeville argues that our struggle to
comprehend the idea of thinking matter reveals more about the
limitations of human knowledge than it does about the properties of
matter. The notion that an immaterial soul can act upon the body (and
vice versa) poses at least as many difficulties as the idea that
matter can produce thought and consciousness. What is more, Mandeville
stresses that the reason many philosophers have insisted that we
possess an immaterial and immortal soul is not because this is the
most plausible inference to draw from a thorough examination of human
nature, but rather because it is a pleasing idea that makes us feel
better about ourselves. It is an idea that flatters our self-love and
pride, in other words, which means that most people will be inclined
to endorse it even in the absence of any compelling evidence (TH
59&ndash;60, 100&ndash;102; FB I, 230).</p>

<h3 id="ReasPass">2.1 Reason and the passions</h3>

<p>
Mandeville similarly casts doubt on the notion that human conduct is
governed by reason. In &ldquo;An Enquiry Into the Origin of Moral
Virtue&rdquo;, he offers a speculative account of how the lawgivers
who first established society could have persuaded people to resist
their natural appetites and concern themselves with the public
interest. The chief tool at the lawgivers&rsquo; disposal was
flattery: they</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
extoll&rsquo;d the Excellency of our Nature above other Animals
&hellip; [and] bestow&rsquo;d a thousand Encomiums on the Rationality
of our Souls. (FB I, 43)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Those people who indulged their natural appetites without regard to
anyone else were compared to animals, whereas those who resisted their
inclinations and strived to promote the peace and welfare of society
were praised as belonging to a higher class of people. The self-denial
that such people practiced, however, was motivated by the pride they
took in being regarded as members of the superior class (FB I,
42&ndash;44). While we like to believe that we have a rational soul
that distinguishes us from other animals, then, what really sets
humans apart is the extent to which our desire to be thought of in a
certain light drives so much of our behavior&mdash;and that desire is
rooted in the passions.</p>

<p>
Mandeville describes humans as &ldquo;<em>a compound of various
Passions</em>&rdquo;, with our behavior determined by the most
prominent passion on any given occasion (FB I, 39). He adopts a
broadly Hobbesian conception of the will, as &ldquo;the last Result of
deliberation&rdquo;, and contends that we (mistakenly) take our will
to be free because of the difficulties involved in identifying our
motivating passions. Although someone might believe that they are
choosing freely, their judgement is always &ldquo;over rul&rsquo;d by
a predominant Passion&rdquo; that could have been resisted only by a
stronger one (FT 61&ndash;62). Even when people draw on relevant
knowledge before acting, or follow the dictates of reason, they are
still &ldquo;compell&rsquo;d so to do by some Passion or other&rdquo;,
much as those who act in unreasonable ways are led to do so by
different passions. On Mandeville&rsquo;s account, then, all
&ldquo;Human Creatures are sway&rsquo;d and wholly govern&rsquo;d by
their Passions&rdquo; (OH 31).</p>

<p>
Many of Mandeville&rsquo;s contemporaries found this view of human
nature deeply objectionable, for precisely the reasons that he had
anticipated: it dissolves what were often taken to be the most
important distinctions between humans and other animals. As William
Law (1724: 4) complained, Mandeville&rsquo;s depiction of humans as a
compound of various passions &ldquo;seems to suit a <em>Wolf</em> or a
<em>Bear</em>, as exactly as your self, or a <em>Grecian
Philosopher</em>&rdquo;. Law protested that Mandeville&rsquo;s
analysis could not account for the extent to which humans engage in
thought, in ways that set us apart from other animals. Yet
Mandeville&rsquo;s more subtle point is about what drives our
reasoning. He does not deny that we are capable of thought and
reflection, but he presents reason as subservient to the passions.
Indeed, he maintains that we often deploy our reason to justify what
we have already done, rather than using it to determine our actions in
the first place. It is the passions that guide our reason, in this
respect, with self-love &ldquo;furnishing every individual with
Arguments to justify their Inclinations&rdquo; (FB I, 333). As Arthur
Lovejoy observed in 1922, in uncovering the many subconscious
motivations that lead us to rationalize our actions,
Mandeville&rsquo;s &ldquo;chief significance&rdquo; may be understood
in terms of his contribution to the history of social psychology
(personal letter to Kaye given in the notes to FB II, 452).</p>

<h3 id="PsycEgoi">2.2 Psychological egoism</h3>

<p>
It is one thing to claim that humans are creatures of the passions; it
is quite another to insist, as Mandeville also does, that &ldquo;all
Passions center in Self-Love&rdquo; (FB I, 75). Mandeville can thus be
taken as a proponent of what, in the eighteenth century, was sometimes
called the &ldquo;selfish system&rdquo;, a position which today is
better known as psychological egoism (but on the limitations of using
this term to capture Mandeville&rsquo;s position, see Maurer 2019:
58&ndash;85).</p>

<p>
Mandeville regularly seeks to explain how acts that appear to be
motivated by other-regarding passions are in fact different
manifestations of self-love. Suppose we see a baby that is about to
drop into a fire. Mandeville does not doubt that we would immediately
act to save the baby, but he does maintain that, in so doing,
&ldquo;we only obliged our selves&rdquo;, for had the baby fallen then
we would have felt &ldquo;a Pain, which Self-preservation
compell&rsquo;d us to prevent&rdquo; (FB I, 56). Mandeville allows
that witnessing the suffering of others causes us pain and anxiety (FB
I, 254&ndash;255), yet he argues that our pity ultimately derives from
self-love, or self-preservation. Elsewhere, Mandeville similarly
claims that a mother&rsquo;s natural love for her child originates in
self-love (FB I, 75). Even when we care deeply about other people,
then, Mandeville still presents the passions in question as
manifestations of self-love.</p>

<p>
In these cases, it might be objected that Mandeville&rsquo;s position
involves disingenuously redescribing other-regarding passions in terms
of self-love. In challenging the selfish system in the
1720s&mdash;quite possibly with Mandeville in his sights&mdash;Joseph
Butler (1726 [2017: 94]) retorted that &ldquo;this is not the language
of mankind&rdquo;. Passions such as pity and parental love are clearly
not <em>selfish</em> passions, since their satisfaction depends upon
the wellbeing of other people, not merely our own. Similar objections
to the self-love thesis would be raised in turn by Francis Hutcheson,
David Hume, and Adam Smith, amongst others, who suggested that
attempts to root all passions in self-love relied more upon linguistic
sophistry than philosophical insight.</p>

<p>
In other cases, however, Mandeville takes a different approach to
exposing the depths of self-love by focusing on our desire for social
esteem. The key passions here are pride and shame, which work closely
together and result in us becoming preoccupied with our reputation and
relative standing in comparison to other people. Where pride leads us
to desire praise and social approbation, shame leads us to fear
disapproval and criticism. Mandeville argues that these passions lie
behind a remarkable amount of human behavior, motivating us to
regulate our own conduct in accordance with prevailing social norms
and expectations. These passions are so powerful that they will
sometimes outweigh the fear of death, as is best illustrated by the
example of dueling, where the fear of shame leads men of honor to
imperil their lives in order to preserve their social standing and
avoid being thought cowardly (FB I, 334; FB II, 87&ndash;96). In less
extreme cases, pride and shame habitually lead us to conceal other
passions that would be met with social disapproval, and they are
therefore central to Mandeville&rsquo;s explanation of why we
regularly act in ways that appear to be public spirited, even when our
motivations are ultimately self-centered.</p>

<h3 id="SelfLoveSelfLiki">2.3 Self-love and self-liking</h3>

<p>
In the first volume of the <em>Fable</em>, Mandeville contends that
all passions originate in self-love. Yet in both the second volume and
its sequel, <em>An Enquiry into the Origin of Honour</em>, he draws a
distinction between self-love and self-liking (FB II, 129&ndash;134;
OH 3&ndash;8). The idea that all human action can be reduced to
self-love came under sustained attack from philosophers such as Butler
and Hutcheson in the 1720s, and Mandeville may well have introduced
the distinction in response (Tolonen 2013: 49&ndash;65).</p>

<p>
The concept of self-liking can helpfully be understood in relation to
Mandeville&rsquo;s (earlier) account of pride. In the first volume of
the <em>Fable</em>, Mandeville claims that pride is the faculty by
which we overvalue ourselves (FB I, 124), while also equating pride
with the concern we have for our own reputation (FB I, 146). But why,
if we overvalue ourselves, do we care so much about our reputation,
which is based on how <em>others</em> view us? In the second volume of
the <em>Fable</em>, Mandeville supplies a more complete answer to this
question by introducing the concept of self-liking. He now describes
self-liking (rather than pride) as the &ldquo;Instinct, by which every
Individual values itself above its real Worth&rdquo;. As we are
conscious that we overvalue ourselves, however, this instinct is
accompanied by a sense of uneasiness, which leads us to desire the
approbation of other people to &ldquo;strengthen and confirm us in the
good Opinion we have of ourselves&rdquo; (FB II, 130). The approval of
other people, then, eases the apprehension that arises from
overvaluing ourselves.</p>

<p>
Mandeville clarifies that self-liking is the underlying cause of
passions such as pride and shame (FB II, 131&ndash;132; OH 3&ndash;4,
12&ndash;13). Where self-love explains why we are concerned with
matters of sustenance and security, self-liking explains why we care
about our reputation and social standing (FB II, 133&ndash;134). The
significance and bearing of the distinction between self-love and
self-liking for Mandeville&rsquo;s wider philosophy remains a matter
of debate, with scholars disagreeing on the extent to which it
constitutes a refinement or a repudiation of Mandeville&rsquo;s
earlier self-love thesis, and on whether the introduction of
self-liking reflects a more general change in the character of his
moral and social philosophy between the different editions of the
<em>Fable</em> (see especially Hundert 1994: 53&ndash;55,
137&ndash;139; Tolonen 2013: 41&ndash;102; Maurer 2019: 60&ndash;64;
Douglass 2023: 35&ndash;38, 62&ndash;67).</p>

<h2 id="MoraPhil">3. Moral Philosophy</h2>

<p>
The area of Mandeville&rsquo;s thought that has generated the greatest
debate is undoubtedly his moral philosophy. Amongst many competing
views, he has been read as a sceptic who aims to expose morality as a
political trick while subverting the prevailing moral standards of his
day, as a moral rigorist who seeks to demonstrate that much of our
behavior falls considerably short of the demands of virtue, and as a
utilitarian who holds that what really matters is the consequences of
our actions and not the motives behind them (for an extensive survey,
see Monro 1975: 178&ndash;248). Our aim presently is not to pass
judgement on the validity of these or other interpretations. Instead,
we focus on some of the key questions and puzzles that arise from the
most influential statement of Mandeville&rsquo;s moral philosophy,
&ldquo;An Enquiry Into the Origin of Moral Virtue&rdquo;, in which he
explains how humans could have acquired ideas of virtue and vice
without knowledge of revealed religion.</p>

<h3 id="OrigMoraVirt">3.1 The origin of moral virtue</h3>

<p>
In setting out his account of the origin of virtue, Mandeville
addresses the problem of what leads us to act in ways that advance the
interests of other people and the community. As we have seen,
Mandeville thinks that we are fundamentally self-centered creatures,
which means that we would only resist our natural appetites and
inclinations if we anticipate some personal gain from doing so.
Instead of providing individuals with tangible goods, Mandeville
suggests that &ldquo;lawgivers&rdquo;&mdash;a broad concept that often
encompasses those with the authority to establish moral
rules&mdash;would have used praise and contempt as foundational tools
to civilize humanity. Those who resist their selfish inclinations and
act in ways that benefit others would be rewarded with praise, while
those who indulge their appetites without regard to the public good
would be held in contempt. It is on this basis, Mandeville argues,
that everyone would have come to agree on definitions of virtue and
vice. All acts where someone gratifies their appetites in a way that
could prove socially detrimental would be counted as vices, with the
term virtue reserved for acts where someone resists their natural
impulses and endeavors &ldquo;the Benefit of others, or the Conquest
of his own Passions out of a Rational Ambition of being good&rdquo;
(FB I, 42&ndash;49).</p>

<p>
On this account, we hold certain ideas of virtue and vice only because
doing so is in everyone&rsquo;s interest. Where those who approximate
this standard of virtue have an interest in being esteemed as
virtuous, those who fall short of this standard nevertheless have an
interest in encouraging others to perform acts from which they
benefit. Mandeville maintains that the earliest formulation of these
ideas was an invention of ambitious lawgivers or politicians who
wanted to govern people more easily. He describes the distinction
between virtue and vice as &ldquo;the Contrivance of
Politicians&rdquo;, and memorably declares that &ldquo;the Moral
Virtues are the Political Offspring which Flattery begot upon
Pride&rdquo; (FB I, 50&ndash;51). These assertions outraged many of
Mandeville&rsquo;s contemporaries, who accused him of bringing the
idea of virtue into disrepute by denying the reality of moral
distinctions. Mandeville&rsquo;s explanation of how we acquire notions
of virtue and vice implicitly rejects views of morality widely held at
the time, such as the idea that we have an innate moral sense that
allows us to understand the distinction between right and wrong, or
that moral obligations can be deduced by right reason as precepts of
natural law. By contrast, his critics argued, Mandeville&rsquo;s
account presents our ideas of virtue and vice as arbitrary, in the
sense that these notions are dependent upon human will and agreement
alone, rather than being based on any immutable or eternal standards
(see e.g., Fiddes 1724: xvi; Law 1724: 22&ndash;23; Bluet 1725:
108&ndash;109, 136). This worry was exacerbated by the fact that
Mandeville elsewhere flirts with moral relativism, highlighting
examples of how moral codes vary in different cultures to challenge
the idea that virtue and vice are &ldquo;permanent Realities that must
ever be the same in all Countries and all Ages&rdquo; (FB I, 324,
330&ndash;331).</p>

<p>
As his critics also pointed out, the role of wise lawgivers or
politicians in Mandeville&rsquo;s account is somewhat
question-begging, as it remains unclear how they attained the
knowledge required to civilize everyone else (e.g., Bluet 1725:
25&ndash;28). Yet Mandeville&rsquo;s later works do not rely on these
figures to anywhere near the same degree, and, when they are invoked,
he explains their inventions as the joint labor of numerous people
over many ages (OH 40&ndash;41). He still maintains that humans do not
naturally possess any equitable or reasonable notions of right and
wrong (FB II, 223&ndash;224), arguing instead that we would have come
to acquire such notions only through a long period of socialization.
He also insists that this explanation does not involve denigrating
virtue, as his critics had objected. Comparing the excellence of
virtue to axioms of mathematics, Mandeville allows that it makes sense
to call these eternal truths in a figurative sense, but the key point
is that a great deal of learning is needed to discover them. To stress
the difficulties involved in arriving at these truths, however, is not
to deny their existence (OH vii&ndash;viii).</p>

<p>
One way of understanding Mandeville&rsquo;s position is that, given
certain background facts about human nature and social interaction,
ideas of virtue and vice are necessary for societies to function
effectively. The distinction between virtue and vice is socially
advantageous, in other words, and we must have come to understand
moral concepts in a certain way to facilitate social order and
cooperation. If this way of reading Mandeville&rsquo;s position helps
to evade the worry that he denied the reality of moral distinctions,
it may nonetheless run into tension with his infamous &ldquo;private
vices, public benefits&rdquo; thesis (see Bluet 1725: 23&ndash;24). On
the one hand, <em>The Grumbling Hive</em> verse suggests that if vices
were rooted out of society and everyone became virtuous then economic
and social ruin would ensue. On the other hand, Mandeville argues that
ideas of virtue and vice are required to ensure that we live
peacefully together. Even if these two strands of his thought can be
reconciled, doing so is far from straightforward (for further
discussion, see Monro 1975, 203&ndash;209).</p>

<h3 id="VirtPoss">3.2 Is virtue possible?</h3>

<p>
Mandeville&rsquo;s definitions of virtue and vice admit of many
ambiguities, giving rise to debates about whether he has a consistent
account of the requirements of virtue, and, if so, whether those
requirements place virtue beyond human reach (see Colman 1972;
Douglass 2020). Leaving aside the question of his sincerity, for the
moment, two features of his expressed position are relatively
uncontroversial. First, virtuous actions require self-denial. This is
clear from Mandeville&rsquo;s initial definition of virtue (FB I,
48&ndash;49), and it is a point that he emphasizes repeatedly when
setting his ideas out against Shaftesbury (e.g., FB I, 323, 331; FB
II, 108&ndash;109). Second, whether an act is virtuous depends on the
motive from which someone acts (FB I, 56, 260&ndash;261). While this
much is straightforward, complications soon arise once we start to
interrogate these requirements further.</p>

<p>
Consider self-denial. How much self-denial is required for an act to
be virtuous? Acting &ldquo;contrary to the impulse of Nature&rdquo;
(FB I, 48) might not be too demanding if it involves nothing more than
resisting one&rsquo;s immediate appetites. Yet more is presumably
required to conquer one&rsquo;s passions. At one point Mandeville
claims that virtue requires &ldquo;a Victory over the Passions&rdquo;.
It is this victory over the passions that distinguishes real virtue
from &ldquo;Counterfeited Virtue&rdquo;, which is merely the
&ldquo;Conquest which one Passion obtains over another&rdquo; (FB I,
230, also 405). When we act in ways that benefit others out of pride
or shame, for example, this does not count as the victory over the
passions required for real virtue, but only the conquest of one
passion over another that characterizes counterfeited virtue. This is
why good manners and politeness have little to do with real virtue (FB
I, 79; FB II, 146, 281). How, then, can we obtain the victory over the
passions required for real virtue? If all our actions are governed by
our passions, as Mandeville maintains, then it follows that a victory
over the passions is impossible&mdash;at least without divine
assistance (FT 24; OH 56, 99&ndash;100). Notice, however, that even if
real virtue is beyond human reach, this does not imperil the
widespread practice of counterfeited virtue, where people act in ways
that appear to be public-spirited because they desire social
esteem.</p>

<p>
These considerations relate closely to the question of the motive
behind virtuous acts. What counts as a virtuous motive? Mandeville
sometimes implies that acting from self-love cannot be &ldquo;truly
Virtuous&rdquo; (FB I, 133), from which it would follow (insofar as we
read Mandeville as endorsing psychological egoism) that we can never
act from truly virtuous motives. At other points, he stresses the
importance of acting out of &ldquo;a Rational Ambition of being
good&rdquo; (FB I, 49, 260), without spelling out precisely what this
entails. If it merely involves reflecting on whether your action is
likely to benefit society before deciding whether to perform it, then
this level of rational reflection is compatible with the presence of
self-centered motives, such as pride. After all, we are more likely to
receive the praise that will satisfy our pride if we perform acts that
benefit society. If, however, acting from a rational ambition of being
good requires being motivated by reason alone, without being affected
by one&rsquo;s passions, then this is beyond the reach of creatures
governed by their passions. Whether or not real virtue is possible, on
Mandeville&rsquo;s account, thus depends on how some of the more
ambiguous clauses in his definition are interpreted. At times
Mandeville seems happy to leave the reader guessing, sometimes
observing (against Shaftesbury) that it is no &ldquo;Affront to Virtue
to make it inaccessible&rdquo; (FB I, 23), while in other places
defending himself against this very charge (e.g., FB II, 50, 336).</p>

<h3 id="QuesSinc">3.3 The question of sincerity</h3>

<p>
Given the ambiguities, equivocations, and perhaps even contradictions
in Mandeville&rsquo;s analysis of virtue, it is unsurprising that
readers remain divided over how to make sense of his position. The
main source of disagreement, however, is not so much the question of
Mandeville&rsquo;s consistency as that of his sincerity. He
<em>says</em> that the <em>Fable</em> &ldquo;is a Book of severe and
exalted morality, that contains a strict Test of Virtue&rdquo; (FB I,
404&ndash;405), but is this what he really <em>means</em>? Many of his
contemporaries took the <em>Fable</em> to be a celebration of vice and
an attack on virtue and Christianity, with Mandeville&rsquo;s claims
to the contrary treated as an insincere guise adopted to deflect
criticism and censure.</p>

<p>
The main reason Mandeville&rsquo;s sincerity has frequently been
doubted is that he appears to revel in highlighting the most
scandalous implications of his own analysis. His tone is often
humorous or playful, and, despite what he says, if the road to worldly
prosperity and glory diverges from the road to virtue, then Mandeville
seems relatively untroubled by the fact that we invariably choose the
former. Indeed, he repeatedly criticizes those&mdash;especially the
clergy&mdash;who complain about the moral degeneracy of society while
being far from paragons of virtue themselves. That Mandeville aimed to
expose the hypocrisy of such people is beyond doubt, yet it is less
clear what the implications are for understanding his own moral
philosophy. Some commentators have read Mandeville as a libertine or
hedonist, whose rigoristic definition of virtue was insincere and
adopted solely for satirical purposes (e.g., Viner 1953 [1991:
178&ndash;182]; Harth 1969; Nieli 1989). Others, by contrast, have not
only taken Mandeville&rsquo;s rigorism seriously, but even suggested
that he saw his philosophy as resting firmly on Christian foundations
(e.g., Chiasson 1970; Crisp 2019: 60&ndash;73). Another influential
view is that there is a genuine tension between Mandeville&rsquo;s
rigoristic conception of virtue and the more general empiricist bent
of his philosophy, with the latter aligning more closely with
utilitarianism (Kaye 1924a: lii&ndash;lvi).</p>

<p>
When approaching these debates, it is helpful to consider the
<em>scope</em> of Mandeville&rsquo;s moral philosophy and its
relationship with his social and political ideas. In theory, at least,
one could be a moral rigorist at the level of individual ethics and
nonetheless think that utilitarian concerns are more appropriate in
the political sphere&mdash;the key point, for Mandeville, is that
political questions should be evaluated without relying on any
particular theory of individual ethics (see Maxwell 1951). More
generally still, it is worth recalling that one of Mandeville&rsquo;s
main goals was not to tell us how we ought to behave, but to explain
how we do behave (FB I, 39). Insofar as this goal applies to his moral
philosophy, we will likely go astray if we assume that Mandeville was
concerned with defending a particular ethical position that we should
strive to identify. His moral philosophy may be better understood as
an investigation into the role that moral concepts, such as virtue and
vice, play in our social lives. This explanatory project, which seeks
to make sense of moral ideas as social phenomena, extends well beyond
his conceptions of virtue and vice to encompass a wide range of social
and political norms.</p>

<h2 id="SociPoliNorm">4. Social and Political Norms</h2>

<p>
Mandeville was a keen observer of social and political norms. While
this is evident throughout his writings, the evolutionary accounts of
various social phenomena that he develops in his later works
constitute his most original and significant contribution to social
philosophy. Central to his analysis is the relationship between the
passions and the emergence of larger societal structures. This
relationship is also evident in his analysis of gender, religion, and
economics, which we consider here as illustrative examples of how
Mandeville&rsquo;s underlying account of human nature informs his
wider study of society and politics.</p>

<h3 id="N41EvolCiviSoci">4.1 The evolution of civil society</h3>

<p>
In <em>The Fable of the Bees, Part II</em>, Mandeville offers an
evolutionary account of the origin of society that aims to explain how
humans could have acquired the capacity to govern other people and
learned to regulate their passions in ways that avoid conflict. Rather
than operating with a stark dichotomy between the state of nature and
civil society, Mandeville charts the various stages of a much
lengthier developmental process, starting from a primitive society and
gradually progressing towards the establishment of laws and norms of
politeness over many centuries.</p>

<p>
The most basic social unit, for Mandeville, is the primitive family,
and he identifies three steps that would have led families to start
working together before eventually forming civil societies. The first
step is the fear of wild animals, which would have incentivized
families to unite for purposes of common defense. As humans also pose
a considerable threat to one another, the second step is fear of other
humans who seek to domineer over everyone else. At this stage humans
would have divided into different bands, with band leaders slowly
learning through a process of trial-and-error how to govern their
subjects. The third and final step is the invention of written laws,
which is necessary for stable government and long-term peaceful
coexistence (FB II, 266&ndash;269).</p>

<p>
A civil society is one governed in accordance with written laws.
Crucially, it is only at this juncture that human interactions would
be regulated by any meaningful notions of justice. Prior to being
educated and socialized, Mandeville claims that we would consider it
just to take possession of anything we can, and unjust to be deprived
of anything we possess&mdash;a bare bones notion of justice that would
be incapable of resolving any disagreements or quarrels (FB II, 200).
Written laws are required before justice can be administered equitably
and reliably, and it is likewise only after many generations that we
would be &ldquo;led into the Method of thinking justly&rdquo; (FB II,
219, also 236). Once laws that protect personal safety and private
property are instituted, everything else falls into place. In
particular, individuals enjoy a level of security that allows them to
pursue the objects of their self-love more industriously through the
division of labor (FB II, 283&ndash;284, 300). While Mandeville denies
that there is any natural motive that prevents people from taking
others&rsquo; possessions, the establishment of written laws and
property rights creates a framework that incentivizes individuals to
respect these boundaries.</p>

<p>
Where justice is especially important for safeguarding the objects of
our self-love, polite social norms allow us to cultivate self-liking
in mutually beneficial ways. Mandeville claims that norms of
politeness gradually arise once markets for luxury goods develop (FB
II, 147), yet the example most familiar to his readers would have been
the complex sport of upper-class manners observed in many of the
European societies of his day. The most effective way to gain the good
opinion of others and thereby satisfy our self-liking is through
mutual discretion. Given that we all hold inflated views of ourselves,
it is inadvisable to display our self-liking openly in public.
Flattering other people and playing down our own qualities thus
constitutes the height of good manners, with the politest people
knowing</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
not only to deny the high Value they have for themselves, but likewise
to pretend that they have greater Value for others, than they have for
themselves. (FB II, 145)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Social norms of politeness thus generate a positive cycle that
nurtures everyone&rsquo;s self-liking by adopting various means to
please others while concealing our true motives and high opinions of
ourselves.</p>

<p>
Mandeville&rsquo;s historical narratives show how the passions central
to human nature give rise to social institutions that promote
prosperity. Much of this development occurs unconsciously and
unintentionally, with individuals unaware of their role in shaping
social institutions. For example, we learn norms of politeness through
emulation and experience, without understanding either the social
function that politeness serves or even the underlying motives from
which we act. This is often accomplished without any reflection or
foresight; over a great deal of time, we &ldquo;fall as it were into
these Things spontaneously&rdquo; (FB II, 139). Mandeville explains
the origin of languages in terms of a similar process. He speculates
that speech must have first been developed with the objective of
persuading and displaying superiority over other people, even though
language would subsequently come to serve many other purposes (FB II,
289&ndash;295). The invention of written laws, for instance, became
possible only once language had advanced to an adequate level, and as
language becomes increasingly complex it facilitates the refinement of
norms of politeness.</p>

<p>
Once civil society is established, Mandeville thinks that the
government has a crucial role to play in maintaining social order.
That role, however, does not involve radically transforming the
political and social institutions that have developed over time, but
rather ensuring that those institutions continue to function
effectively. A well-constituted society is analogous to a
well-designed clock, in this respect, which will continue to operate
by itself so long as people remember to wind it up. This means that
civil societies can be governed effectively by people who do not
possess any extraordinary knowledge or virtues (FB II, 322&ndash;324).
Civil society is a complex arrangement and those who tamper with its
roots&mdash;by clamoring for a moral reformation, for
instance&mdash;will invariably do more harm than good. Mandeville
develops this line of thought further elsewhere, claiming that, rather
than depending upon the qualities of virtuous politicians, the best
constitution is that &ldquo;which provides against the worst
Contingencies &hellip; and preserves itself firm and remains unshaken,
though most Men should prove Knaves&rdquo; (FT 167). In advancing this
case, Mandeville breaks sharply from the classical republican
tradition that had stressed the importance of civic virtue in public
life, instead setting out an approach to understanding politics now
more often associated with Hume&rsquo;s analysis of constitutional
government (Moore 1977: 824&ndash;826).</p>

<h3 id="Gend">4.2 Gender</h3>

<p>
On Mandeville&rsquo;s evolutionary account of society, the variation
we observe in norms and behavior is a result of education and
socialization, with human nature remaining constant throughout. There
is no difference, he claims, &ldquo;between the original Nature of a
Savage, and that of a civiliz&rsquo;d Man&rdquo; (FB II, 214); they
both possess the same passions, but these are cultivated differently
due to the social environments in which they are raised. Much the same
applies when it comes to his analysis of gender roles, and across his
works Mandeville challenges many of the assumptions held at the time
regarding the supposedly natural differences between the sexes.</p>

<p>
Mandeville&rsquo;s views on women are not especially well-known
(although for notable contributions, see Goldsmith 1986; O&rsquo;Brien
2009: 19&ndash;27; Branchi 2022: 38&ndash;55). In part, this is
because some of his most striking contributions are found in his least
famous works. In both <em>The Virgin Unmask&rsquo;d</em> and his
contributions to <em>The Female Tatler</em>, Mandeville adopts a
dialogue format with a range of female characters expressing many of
his most important ideas. In the &ldquo;Preface&rdquo; to the former,
he announces that his aim &ldquo;is to let young Ladies know whatever
is dreadful in Marriage&rdquo;. Every married woman, one of his
characters declares, is &ldquo;a Slave to her Husband&rdquo;, with the
respect and affection that men display towards women being no more
than an outward show that serves to conceal the reality of
subordination (VU 127&ndash;128). As well as exposing the
extent&mdash;and sometimes brutal violence&mdash;of women&rsquo;s
oppression in the domestic sphere, the female interlocutors in <em>The
Virgin Unmaks&rsquo;d</em> also discuss Louis XIV&rsquo;s politics in
considerable detail, with Mandeville thereby implying that educated
women can analyze the public sphere with a level of insight that many
of his contemporaries would have considered the preserve of men alone.
In a similar vein, some of Mandeville&rsquo;s contributions to <em>The
Female Tatler</em> return to the idea that marriage is akin to
slavery, while also providing examples of women who have excelled in
learning, valor, and other such qualities. The reason so few women
have been recognized as great or virtuous is simply that they live
under &ldquo;the Injustice and Tyranny of the Men&rdquo;, who, like
all conquerors, endeavor to keep their captives ignorant for fear of
otherwise losing their dominion (EFT, especially 171&ndash;174).</p>

<p>
Mandeville&rsquo;s views on women do not always point so
straightforwardly in a feminist direction, as is most evident in the
considerations that he raises for tolerating sex work as a lesser evil
(on which, see Rosenthal 2006: 42&ndash;69; Nacol 2015). In the
<em>Fable</em>, Mandeville approaches this topic in terms of
sacrificing one group of women to preserve the chastity and social
status of another, since lustful men will inevitably find some way of
satisfying their carnal desires, and the language that he uses to
describe sex workers hardly invites much sympathy with their plight
(FB I, 95&ndash;100). This is a topic that is explored further in
<em>A Modest Defence of Publick Stews</em>&mdash;a pamphlet published
anonymously in 1724 that is now widely attributed to Mandeville
(although for evidence raising doubts about this attribution, see
Ryan, Mahadevan, &amp; Tolonen 2023: 41&ndash;46)&mdash;which sets out
a case (whether sincerely or not) for the provision of public
brothels. Up to a point, at least, <em>A Modest Defence</em> does show
a little more concern for the welfare of sex workers, who would be
less exposed to violence and disease if their trade was legalized and
regulated.</p>

<p>
A recurring theme throughout Mandeville&rsquo;s various discussions of
women is the way that norms of chastity and female modesty are
socially constructed and inculcated in young girls from a very early
age. Girls are taught to feel ashamed of displaying their legs, for
example, long before they could have any understanding of why this is
deemed inappropriate. There is nothing natural about the different
standards of modesty for men and women, Mandeville maintains, which
should instead be understood as the consequence of education alone (FB
I, 72&ndash;73). Chastity is the basis of female honor in much the
same way as courage is the basis of male honor. Where soldiers risk
their lives in battle for fear of being thought cowardly, educated
women fend off the advances of men, while resisting their own sexual
desires, for fear of being thought promiscuous. Even if these examples
strike readers today as somewhat archaic, they nonetheless serve to
illustrate Mandeville&rsquo;s broader point: shame is the underlying
passion that leads all of us to care deeply about our reputation, even
though what is taken to be shameful is determined by the prevailing
social norms and will thus vary in different times and places, and
amongst those of different social status.</p>

<h3 id="Reli">4.3 Religion</h3>

<p>
Many of Mandeville&rsquo;s contemporaries considered him a deeply
irreligious thinker, largely because they took him to be celebrating
vice against all religious and moral precepts. Yet his views on
religion are far more complex and nuanced. In his later works,
Mandeville argues that humans are naturally disposed towards religious
belief. The seed of religion is one of our natural passions: fear of
an invisible power. Uneducated humans, with no knowledge of revealed
religion, would live in fear of unexpected phenomena that could
threaten their existence, such as extreme weather conditions or
diseases. From a young age, Mandeville observes, we all
anthropomorphize the world around us and assume that even inanimate
things feel and think as we do, so the idea that there is some
intelligent agency behind natural phenomena comes very easily to us.
We are also especially inquisitive in relation to things that harm us,
and we would soon seek an explanation for anything that imperils our
survival. Without any scientific understanding of the processes at
work, however, uneducated humans would assume that dangerous natural
phenomena are caused by an invisible power, leading them to extend
their fear of the phenomena to the invisible power itself. There could
be as many invisible powers as there are phenomena in question, which
is why polytheism has been so common throughout human history. As the
fear of an invisible cause is ingrained in human nature, Mandeville
claims that it persists in all civilized societies and that no
religion can dispense with this natural seed (FB II,
207&ndash;214).</p>

<p>
Mandeville&rsquo;s account of the origin of natural religion has
significant political implications. One is that &ldquo;no Nations can
be govern&rsquo;d without Religion&rdquo;. Those who deny the
existence of an invisible cause will not be believed by the multitude,
so anyone who hopes to govern a society must humor our fear of an
invisible cause and turn it to their own advantage. The main temporal
benefit of religion is in promoting civic allegiance, as no
one&rsquo;s word can be relied upon if they do not fear some form of
deity (OH 21&ndash;25). Even if the tie of religion might not be
strong enough to govern everyone&mdash;hence the need for codes of
honor in early-modern Europe&mdash;Mandeville&rsquo;s account of the
natural seed of religion precludes the possibility of a society of
atheists.</p>

<p>
While religion can have civic benefits, Mandeville was well aware that
it often serves the ends of persecution and schism, amongst other
evils. These are concerns that he discusses most fully in <em>Free
Thoughts on Religion</em>, which attacks priestcraft and makes the
case for tolerating all religious sects that recognize the authority
of the government in matters of church and state (FT 140). Mandeville
lays much of the blame for religious conflict with the clergy, while
often aiming to reveal that they are just as vice-ridden as the laity.
This involves little more than an application of his wider account of
human nature. As &ldquo;Pride and Ambition are so riveted in our
Nature&rdquo;, any group of people will seek to dominate and tyrannize
others if given the opportunity to do so (FT 156). The clergy are
certainly no exception, in this regard, and governments should
therefore be extremely wary about entrusting any civil powers to the
church. Mandeville&rsquo;s analysis of the clergy is a good
illustration of one of the broader political implications of his
account of human nature: exposing the hypocrisy and self-centered
motives behind our actions is one way of undermining the standing of
those who appeal to their own moral credentials to wield power over
others (see Douglass 2023: 117&ndash;118).</p>

<h3 id="Econ">4.4 Economics</h3>

<p>
Throughout the twentieth century, there was much debate about whether
Mandeville should be classified as a proponent of laissez-faire or
mercantilist economic doctrines (for critical overviews, see Landreth
1975; Rashid 1985; Prendergast 2016, 104&ndash;112). Evidence
supporting both interpretations can be found, and Mandeville may have
changed his position to some extent between different editions of the
<em>Fable</em>, shifting from a more laissez-faire position when
analyzing economic demand to a more mercantilist one when examining
labor supply (Dew 2005). Indeed, one area where his economic thinking
closely intersects with his broader social and political philosophy
concerns his views on the working poor.</p>

<p>
In defending the thesis that private vices lead to public benefits,
Mandeville maintains that the advantages of commercial prosperity
extend to the lowest classes in society, with the poorest members of
flourishing states enjoying more of the comforts of life than even the
richest classes in less economically-developed societies (FB I,
169&ndash;172). Yet Mandeville does not support the liberal reward of
labor&mdash;as David Hume and Adam Smith would later do&mdash;and
instead endorses a version of the utility of poverty thesis. While the
poor should have enough to survive, Mandeville argues that the state
benefits more if the poor spend their entire income, rather than being
able to build up savings. The poor are generally &ldquo;more prone to
Ease and Pleasure than they are to Labour&rdquo;, and thus will only
work if driven to do so by immediate necessity (FB I, 192&ndash;194).
What is more, it is important that the poor are kept uneducated and do
not acquire aspirations that will only be disappointed by striving to
emulate the more affluent classes. The poor will be happier with their
lot if their expectations are not raised beyond what they can ever
hope to attain (FB I, 287&ndash;290).</p>

<p>
As these remarks indicate, not only does Mandeville recognize that the
societies of his day were demarcated into different socioeconomic
classes, but he also holds that it is unrealistic&mdash;and even
undesirable&mdash;to try to change this. He argues that maintaining
clear class distinctions would protect the self-esteem of the working
poor, who comprised most of the population. By ensuring that the lower
classes do not compare themselves to those above them on the social
ladder, their self-image could be preserved, leading to greater
happiness and satisfaction with their condition. There is nothing
egalitarian about the way that the economy of esteem plays out in
Mandeville&rsquo;s social vision.</p>

<p>
One striking feature of Mandeville&rsquo;s analysis of the working
poor is that he does not allow that the desire for social standing and
esteem could reliably motivate people to perform menial labor. Given
the importance that he elsewhere accords to pride, envy, and emulation
in stimulating the demand for luxury goods, Mandeville&rsquo;s
discussion of the motivations of the laboring poor may seem at odds
with his more general account of human nature (Pongiglione &amp;
Tolonen 2016: 89&ndash;93). Adam Smith (1759 [1976: 50]) would later
remark that it &ldquo;is chiefly from this regard to the sentiments of
mankind, that we pursue riches and avoid poverty&rdquo;, and the
thought that what drives the economy is not the desire for material
possessions as much as the status and good opinion that wealth confers
fits well with much of Mandeville&rsquo;s analysis of human nature.
When it comes to the working classes, however, he contends that it is
only economic necessity, and not the desire for social esteem, that
can secure the labor supply of a prosperous economy.</p>

<h2 id="Lega">5. Legacy</h2>

<p>
<em>The Fable of the Bees</em> was one of the most scandalous books
published in eighteenth-century Europe. Beyond the work&rsquo;s
notoriety, however, it played an important role in the development of
social and moral philosophy throughout the century, and, while not so
widely read subsequently, it continued to attract the attention of
some of the most famous philosophers and social scientists in the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries (for wide-ranging surveys, see Kaye
1924a: cxiv&ndash;cxlvi; Hundert 1994: 237&ndash;249).</p>

<h3 id="N51EighCentRece">5.1 Eighteenth-century reception</h3>

<p>
Although the public reception of Mandeville&rsquo;s work in 1720s
Britain was largely hostile, it swiftly elevated him to fame (for a
collection of responses, see Stafford 1997). By 1732, over 300 reports
on the <em>Fable</em> had appeared in the British press (Revolti
2016), and Benjamin Franklin sought to meet Mandeville when he came to
London in 1725. A strong case can also be made that Mandeville&rsquo;s
mature philosophy proved very influential in the Scottish and wider
European Enlightenment, with some of his key ideas being developed by
David Hume, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Adam Smith, amongst others
(see, e.g., Castiglione 1986; Goldsmith 1988; Hundert 1994; Robertson
2005: 256&ndash;324; Heath 2014). Even when these philosophers
criticized Mandeville directly, they appear to have adopted some of
his key insights about the evolution of social norms and the
importance of passions such as self-liking (or, in Rousseau&rsquo;s
lexicon, <em>amour-propre</em>) that lead us to care deeply about our
social standing.</p>

<p>
Reviewing Rousseau&rsquo;s <em>Discours sur l&rsquo;origine et les
fondements de l&rsquo;in&eacute;galit&eacute; parmi les hommes</em>,
Smith (1756 [1980: 250]) claimed that &ldquo;the second volume of the
Fable of the Bees has given occasion to the system of Mr.
Rousseau&rdquo;, noting that they both denied natural sociability and
set out accounts of how humans gradually come to acquire the qualities
required to live together in society. Indeed, one of the most striking
features of Mandeville&rsquo;s conjectural history of society is that
it implicitly rejects the social contract approaches associated with
political philosophers like Thomas Hobbes and John Locke, and instead
places much more emphasis on how conventions of justice and politeness
could have emerged over time&mdash;an approach that would be developed
further and more famously in Hume&rsquo;s <em>A Treatise of Human
Nature</em> (Tolonen 2013). Similarly, Mandeville&rsquo;s naturalistic
explanation of how language first developed may well have influenced
&Eacute;tienne Bonnot de Condillac and helped to shape subsequent
debates on the origin of language (Kaye 1924b; Schreyer 1978; Hundert
1994: 86&ndash;115).</p>

<p>
In these respects, <em>The Fable of the Bees</em> is a
quintessentially Enlightenment text. It offers a naturalistic account
of the origins of society and morality, without appealing to God-given
natural law, in the vein of Locke, or to any strong (and sometimes
theologically grounded) assumptions about the reach of human
benevolence&mdash;the very assumptions to which Francis Hutcheson
would appeal, as one of Mandeville&rsquo;s most trenchant critics.
When confronted with serious religious thinkers like Hutcheson and
especially George Berkeley, Mandeville reaffirmed his intellectual
integrity and claimed that the outrage caused by the <em>Fable</em>
was largely due to people criticizing it without having read it
carefully. He insisted that the <em>Fable</em> should be read as
&ldquo;a Philosophical Disquisition into the Force of the Passions,
and the Nature of Society&rdquo; (LD 54&ndash;55), and it appears to
have had the greatest philosophical impact amongst those who did take
it seriously in these terms, such as Hume and Smith.</p>

<p>
Mandeville&rsquo;s economic ideas also proved influential in the
eighteenth century, not least in France, where his ideas on luxury
were taken up by Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Melon and Voltaire (Hont 2006).
French translations of some of Mandeville&rsquo;s texts, including
<em>Free Thoughts on Religion</em>, appeared even before his rise to
fame following the 1723 edition of the <em>Fable</em>. The French
press extensively reviewed and discussed his works, especially once a
full translation of both parts of the <em>Fable</em> was published in
1740 (Muceni 2015). While the influence of Mandeville&rsquo;s ideas
was greatest in eighteenth-century Britain and France, his works also
received wider attention throughout the century, including in Germany
(Fabian 1976) and the Dutch Republic (Hengstmengel &amp; Verburg
2023).</p>

<h3 id="NineCentRece">5.2 Nineteenth-century reception</h3>

<p>
Mandeville&rsquo;s ideas continued to captivate the minds of important
thinkers during the nineteenth century, sparking debates that extended
into the twentieth century and beyond. For example, Karl Marx (1867
[1976: 764&ndash;765]) quoted at length from Mandeville&rsquo;s
discussion of the utility of poverty, which he regarded as a brutally
honest assessment of the extent to which a thriving capitalist economy
depends upon a poor underclass being kept at subsistence level. In
addition, Marx (1867 [1976: 475]) claimed that parts of Adam
Smith&rsquo;s analysis of the division of labor were &ldquo;copied
almost word for word&rdquo; from Mandeville. Other influential
thinkers also turned to Mandeville&rsquo;s ideas for insights into
explaining complex societal phenomena. In particular, his attempts to
naturalize social norms and institutions by charting their historical
origins gave rise to questions about the relationship between
individual behavior and collective outcomes that would dominate later
social science, and which were taken up in very different ways in (for
example) Thomas Malthus&rsquo;s work on population dynamics and Jeremy
Bentham&rsquo;s account of utilitarianism (Gaukroger 2016:
267&ndash;302). Perhaps most notably, Charles Darwin appears to have
read the second volume of the <em>Fable</em> closely and may have
drawn inspiration from Mandeville&rsquo;s conjectural history when
developing his own evolutionary theory, recognizing its relevance for
thinking through how unintended consequences and gradual change could
relate to processes of natural selection (Alter 2008).</p>

<p>
The nineteenth century also witnessed more systematic attempts to
categorize Mandeville&rsquo;s thought. This intellectual endeavor
found fertile ground in Germany, where a flourishing school of
scholarship emerged around Mandeville&rsquo;s ideas in the later part
of the century. One notable milestone was Paul Sakmann&rsquo;s seminal
work, <em>Bernard de Mandeville und die Bienenfabel-controverse</em>
(1897), to which F. A. Hayek would later acknowledge a significant
debt (Nolan 2016). Parallel to the burgeoning interest in Germany, the
categorization of Mandeville&rsquo;s intellectual contributions also
gained momentum in Britain. Mandeville&rsquo;s impact endured
throughout the nineteenth century in England, as is evident from
references to him in general magazines and other thinkers&rsquo;
works, especially in relation to discussions of ethics, economics, and
human behavior. One staunch advocate of Mandeville was James Crossley,
a celebrated collector and champion of Epicurean moral philosophy, who
actively fostered dialogues around Mandeville&rsquo;s writings,
consolidating his prominence in the intellectual milieu of the time
(Tolonen 2010: 29). Mandeville&rsquo;s importance to the history of
moral philosophy was further established with the publication of
Leslie Stephen&rsquo;s <em>Essays on Freethinking and
Plainspeaking</em> (1873: 243&ndash;278) and <em>The History of
English Thought in the Eighteenth Century</em> (1876: 15&ndash;46),
which presented Mandeville and Shaftesbury as occupying the poles
between which subsequent British moral philosophy had to navigate.</p>

<h3 id="N53TwenCentRece">5.3 Twentieth-century reception</h3>

<p>
As the twentieth century dawned, Mandeville&rsquo;s works had become
rare physical artefacts and it was difficult to obtain copies of his
books. Frederick Benjamin Kaye played a key role in remedying this and
catalyzing Mandeville&rsquo;s reception. His two-volume edition of
<em>The Fable of the Bees</em>&mdash;first published in 1924 by the
Clarendon Press and later reissued by the Liberty Fund in
1988&mdash;reshaped the landscape for reading Mandeville. Kaye&rsquo;s
impact was so substantial that it rendered much earlier scholarship
almost inconspicuous, with his edition also playing an indispensable
role in making Mandeville&rsquo;s ideas more accessible to
contemporary students and scholars ever since.</p>

<p>
In the early decades of the twentieth century, Mandeville&rsquo;s
ideas continued to be discussed amongst a range of different scholarly
audiences. At one point Mandeville had suggested that humans would be
unwilling to kill animals for food were it &ldquo;not for this Tyranny
which Custom usurps over us&rdquo; (FB I, 173), and the renowned early
twentieth-century Finnish sociologist, Edvard Westermarck, even
identified Mandeville as an advocate of vegetarianism (1939: 392). In
the Anglophone world, however, Mandeville&rsquo;s ideas were most
often invoked in debates about the history of economic thought. Kaye
(1924a: cxxxix) had claimed that &ldquo;Mandeville maintains, and
maintains explicitly, the theory at present known as the
<em>laissez-faire</em> theory&rdquo;, yet this interpretation was soon
contested by some of the most prominent economists of the period. In
<em>The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money</em>, John
Maynard Keynes (1936 [2018: 319&ndash;322]) included Mandeville in his
survey of the history of mercantilist economic doctrines, stressing
the importance of consumption rather than saving in Mandeville&rsquo;s
explanation of economic growth. It was Jacob Viner (1953 [1991:
183&ndash;184]), however, who did most to challenge Kaye&rsquo;s claim
by presenting Mandeville as &ldquo;a convinced adherent of the
prevailing mercantilism of his time&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
In aiming to add nuance to and ultimately move beyond the
mercantilism/laissez-faire debate, Nathan Rosenberg (1963) and F. A.
Hayek (1966) sought to recover and foreground the evolutionary aspects
of Mandeville&rsquo;s account of social development. Amongst
Mandeville&rsquo;s more famous twentieth-century readers, no one has
taken his social philosophy as seriously as Hayek. In a talk delivered
to the British Academy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Master-Mind&rdquo; lecture
series, Hayek (1966: 126) played down the importance of
Mandeville&rsquo;s economic ideas and instead credited his work with
marking &ldquo;the definitive breakthrough in modern thought of the
twin ideas of evolution and of the spontaneous formation of an
order&rdquo;. According to Hayek, Mandeville understood that people
are biased and neither foresee nor understand the macro-level
consequences of their individual actions. Hayek saw this propensity
for self-deception as a reason not to trust any individual, no matter
how enlightened, to guide society towards a centrally planned future.
In line with Mandeville&rsquo;s thinking, Hayek criticized
constructivist rationalism and what he took to be the wrong kind of
individualism rooted in excessive faith in human reason. Hayek thus
followed Mandeville in emphasizing the limitations of human knowledge
and, on this basis, advocated for the decentralized decision-making
that takes place in the market.</p>

<p>
For Hayek, spontaneous orders are well-structured social patterns that
seem like they must have been designed by an omniscient mind, but
which are in fact the unplanned and uncoordinated outcomes of
countless individuals&rsquo; actions. Hayek regarded
Mandeville&rsquo;s social philosophy as exemplifying a more general
theory that explains how a coherent aggregate structure can emerge
accidentally from the actions of individuals, regardless of whether
those actions are altruistic or egoistic. Hayek therefore saw
Mandeville as an important precursor of his own ideas on the
spontaneous evolution of rules and institutions within an
equilibrating economic system. Mandeville might not have fully grasped
the extent of his own discovery, according to Hayek, but he set a line
of thought in motion that would be developed more extensively in the
Scottish Enlightenment. The highest accolade that Hayek (1966: 139)
could grant Mandeville was that &ldquo;he made Hume possible&rdquo;.
More generally, Mandeville&rsquo;s emphasis on individualism and
economic self-interest resonated with Hayek&rsquo;s belief in the role
of self-interest in economic coordination. Even if Mandeville&rsquo;s
views were rooted in the mercantilist tradition, then, his exploration
of the mechanisms through which self-interest can contribute to the
public good would influence later classical liberal thinkers.</p>

<p>
The final three decades of the twentieth century witnessed a
significant increase in scholarly interest in Mandeville, with several
important book-length studies appearing in English, French, and
Italian (Monro 1975; Primer 1975; Horne 1978; Carrive 1980, 1983;
Scribano 1980; Goldsmith 1985; Jack 1987; Schneider 1987; Hundert
1994; Prior 2000). As a result, Mandeville&rsquo;s significance to the
history of philosophy is now recognized within specialist circles,
despite the fact that he is mainly remembered more widely for his
infamous &ldquo;private vices, public benefits&rdquo; paradox. Even
amongst historians of philosophy, attention has been mostly focused on
<em>The Fable of the Bees</em> and there remains relatively little
research dedicated to some of his lesser-known works, such as <em>The
Virgin Unmask&rsquo;d</em>, <em>A Treatise of the Hypochondriack and
Hysterick Passions</em>, and <em>An Enquiry into the Origin of
Honour</em>, which merit greater study if we are to fully appreciate
the depth, range, and social implications of Mandeville&rsquo;s
philosophical investigations into human nature and society.</p>

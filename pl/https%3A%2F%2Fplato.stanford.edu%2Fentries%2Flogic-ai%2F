<h1>Logic-Based Artificial Intelligence</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Aug 27, 2003; substantive revision Tue Feb 27, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Artificial Intelligence (referred to hereafter by its nickname,
&ldquo;AI&rdquo;) is the subfield of Computer Science devoted to
developing programs that enable computers to display behavior that can
(broadly) be characterized as
 intelligent.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Many of the most influential figures in AI&rsquo;s early days had
ambitious goals and views about how to obtain them. John
McCarthy&rsquo;s plan was to use ideas from philosophical logic to
formalize commonsense reasoning. During his lifetime he and his
students and associates pursued projects with a distinctly
philosophical flavor. This theme has persisted, but has mostly been
absorbed into work in knowledge representation. It has become more
directly concerned with applications; the connections to philosophy
and philosophical logic remain, but are more tenuous. </p>

<p>
The new insights and theories that have emerged from AI are of great
potential value in informing and constraining any area of
philosophical inquiry where reasoning is important&mdash;reasoning
about what to do, for instance, or about our own attitudes or the
attitudes of others. Although logic in AI grew out of philosophical
logic, in this new setting it has produced new theories and ambitious
programs that could only have been nurtured by a community devoted to
building working, large-scale computational models of rational
agency.</p>

<p>
This entry assumes an audience consisting primarily of philosophers
who have little or no familiarity with AI. It concentrates on the
issues that arise when logic is used in understanding intelligent
reasoning in mechanized reasoning systems. And it provides a selective
overview, without attempting to achieve anything like complete
coverage.
 <a href="#NonmReasNonmLogi">Sections 3</a>
 and
 <a href="#ReasAbouActiChan">4</a>
 describe two important themes that arose early and have continued to
the present: nonmonotonic logic and reasoning about action and change.
The remaining sections sketch selected topics, with references to the
primary literature.</p>

<h2 id="LogiArtiInte">1. Logic in Artificial Intelligence</h2>

<h3 id="RoleLogiArtiInte">1.1 The Role of Logic in Artificial Intelligence</h3>

<p>
Theoretical computer science developed out of logic, the theory of
computation (if this is to be considered a different subject from
logic), and related areas of
 mathematics.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 So most computer scientists are well informed about logic even if
they aren&rsquo;t logicians. They are familiar with the idea that
logic provides techniques for analyzing the inferential properties of
languages, and with the distinction between a high-level logical
analysis of a reasoning problem and its implementations. Logic can,
for instance, provide a specification for a programming language by
mapping programs to the computations that they should license and
enabling proofs that these computations conform to certain
standards.</p>

<p>
Often, however, the connection between logic and computer programs is
looser than this. Certainly, a software application can be said to
implement a logical formalization when it is provably sound and
complete&mdash;but also merely when logical ideas informed parts of
the software development process. A program that is said to implement
a logical model can be incomplete, or even unsound.</p>

<p>
Sometimes parts of a working system are inspired by ideas from logic
while other parts seem logically problematic. These challenging
features may suggest improvements to the logical theory. So logical
theory informs applications, and applications challenge logical theory
and can lead to theoretical innovations. Logic programming provides
many examples of such interactions.</p>

<p>
Even limited-objective reasoning systems can call for large, complex
bodies of declarative information. It is generally recognized in AI
that it is important to treat declarative representations, along with
their retrieval and maintenance and the reasoning systems they service
as separate items, each with its own research problems. The evolution
of expert systems illustrates the point. The earliest expert systems
were based entirely on large systems of procedural rules, with no
separate representation of the background knowledge. But later
generation expert systems show a greater modularity in their design. A
separate knowledge representation component is useful for software
engineering purposes&mdash;it is much better to have a single
representation of a general fact, capable of many different uses and
making the system easier to develop and to modify. This modularity is
essential in enabling these systems to deliver explanations as well as
mere
 conclusions.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
In response to the need to design this declarative component, a
subfield of AI known as <em>knowledge representation</em> emerged
during the 1980s. Conferences devoted to this topic have taken place
since 1989; these provide an in-depth record of research in the field.
See
 <a href="#Read">Section 12.</a>
 for a list of the proceedings.</p>

<p>
Typical presentations at the KR and Reasoning conferences deal with
the following topics.</p>

<ol>

<li>Topics in logical theory and the theory of computation, including

<ol type="a">

<li>Nonmonotonic logic</li>

<li>Complexity theory</li>
</ol></li>

<li>Studies in application areas, including

<ol type="a">

<li>Temporal reasoning</li>

<li>Formalisms for reasoning about planning, action and change, and
causality</li>

<li>Metareasoning</li>

<li>Reasoning about context</li>

<li>Reasoning about values and desires</li>

<li>Reasoning about the mental states of other agents, and especially
about knowledge and belief</li>

<li>Spatial reasoning</li>

<li>Reasoning about vagueness</li>
</ol></li>

<li>Argumentation and argumentation theory</li>

<li>Aggregation problems of many kinds, such as the integration of
conflicting knowledge sources</li>

<li>Studies in applicable techniques, including

<ol type="a">

<li>Logic programming</li>

<li>Description logics</li>

<li>Theorem proving</li>

<li>Model construction</li>
</ol> </li>

<li>Studies of large-scale applications, including

<ol type="a">

<li>Cognitive robotics</li>

<li>Creating, merging, updating, and correcting knowledge bases</li>

<li>Querying knowledge bases</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>
These topics have little in common with the contents of the
<em>Journal of Symbolic Logic</em>, the premier journal of record for
mathematical logic. But there is substantial overlap with <em>The
Journal of Philosophical Logic</em>, especially in topics such as
tense logic, epistemic logic, logical approaches to practical
reasoning, and belief change. Of course, there also are differences;
very few <em>JPL</em> publications deal with complexity theory or with
potential applications to automated reasoning. </p>

<h3 id="PhilLogi">1.2 Philosophical Logic</h3>

<p>
Founded in 1936, the <em>JSL</em> sought to bring together
mathematicians and philosophers working in logic. Articles in the
first volume were divided about equally between professional
mathematicians and philosophers, and the early volumes do not show any
strong differences between the two groups as to topic.</p>

<p>
This situation changed in the 1960s. The 1969 volume of the
<em>JSL</em> contained 39 articles by mathematicians, and only nine by
philosophers. By the early 1970s, many philosophers felt that
philosophical papers on logic were unlikely to be accepted by the
<em>JSL</em>, and that those that were accepted were unlikely to be
read by philosophers. At this point, the two groups had diverged
markedly. Mathematicians pursued the development of an increasingly
technical and complex body of methods and theorems, and many
philosophers saw this trend as unilluminating and philosophically
irrelevant. These divisions led to the founding of the <em>Journal of
Philosophical Logic</em> in 1972. The list of sample topics in the
first issue included:</p>

<ol>

<li>Contributions to branches of logical theory directly related to
philosophical concerns, such as inductive logic, modal logic, deontic
logic, quantum logic, tense logic, free logic, logic of questions,
logic of commands, logic of preference, logic of conditionals,
many-valued logic, relevance logics;</li>

<li>Contributions to philosophical discussions that utilize the
machinery of formal logic &hellip;;</li>

<li>Discussions of philosophical issues relating to logic and the
logical structure of language, &hellip;;</li>

<li>Philosophical work relating to the special sciences,
&hellip;.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The common thread here is a desire to apply the methods of
mathematical logic to nonmathematical domains. Quantum logic and the
logic of induction, for instance, apply logic to physics and empirical
science. Other topics in the <em>JPL</em> list concern developments in
logic that might be helpful in addressing nonscientific reasoning.
</p>

<h3 id="LogiAIPhilLogi">1.3 Logic in AI and Philosophical Logic</h3>

<p>

 <a href="#mccarthy_j1:1959a1">McCarthy 1959</a>,
 an early contribution to logical AI, discusses the problem of
figuring out how to get to the airport. Here McCarthy proposes a
realistic reasoning problem. Its solution may involve many connected
inferences, and though ultimately it may look like a proof&mdash;a
proof that performing certain actions will produce an outcome in which
someone is located at an airport&mdash;it will differ from a
mathematical exercise because it draws on broader and less tractable
resources. These include causal knowledge as well as goals and
preferences. Contrastingly, research papers in philosophical logic use
reasoning examples to <em>illustrate,</em> rather than to
<em>motivate</em> logical theory and the reasoning examples they cite
are simple, isolated inferences.</p>

<p>
It would not be far wrong to characterize early work in logical AI as
philosophical logic devoted to a new and ambitious application area.
And in fact the first generation of AI 
 logicists<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 read the literature
in philosophical logic and were influenced by it. Subsequently,
however, the specialties have diverged. New logical theories have
emerged in logical AI (nonmonotonic logic is the most important
example) which had not occurred to philosophers. The AI
community&rsquo;s interest in the theoretical analysis of algorithms
and&mdash;of course&mdash;in useful technology are responsible for
other differences. AI researchers are often concerned with ambitious
applications using unprecedentedly large bodies of data and
inferential rules. Their sheer size produces new problems and new
methodologies. And on the other hand, philosophical logicians are
philosophers and as such are often interested in topics (metaphysical
topics, for instance) that are of no interest to computer
scientists.</p>

<p>
If philosophical logic and logic in AI continue to diverge, it will
probably be for such methodological reasons. But despite this, the
fundamental research goals are the same&mdash;logical AI is
philosophical logic constrained by an interest in large-scale
formalization and in feasible, implementable reasoning.</p>

<p>
The early influence of philosophical logic on logic in AI was
profound. The bibliography of
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1-hayes_pj1:1969a1">McCarthy &amp; Hayes 1969</a>,
 one of the most influential early papers in logical AI, illustrates
the point well. There are 58 citations in the bibliography. Of these,
35 refer to the philosophical logic literature. (There are 17 computer
science citations, one mathematical logic citation, one economics
citation, and one psychology citation.) This paper was written at a
time when there were hardly any references to logical AI in the
computer science literature. Naturally, as logical AI has matured and
developed as a branch of computer science, the proportion of
cross-disciplinary citations has decreased. A sampling of articles
from the first Knowledge Representation conference,
 <a href="#brachman-etal:1989b">Brachman <em>et al</em>. 1989</a>,
 held in 1989, shows only 12 philosophical logic citations out of a
total of 522 sampled citations. A sampling of articles from
 <a href="#cohn_ag-etal:1998a">Cohn <em>et al</em>. 1998</a>,
 shows 23 philosophical logic citations out of a total of 468
 sampled.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Despite the dramatic decrease in quantity of explicit citations, the
later literature in logical AI reflects an indirect acquaintance with
philosophical logic, by citing papers in CS venues that were directly
influenced by philosophical work. Of course, the influence becomes
increasingly tenuous as time passes, and this trend is accelerated by
the fact that new theoretical topics have been invented in logical AI
that were at best only dimly prefigured in the philosophical
literature. In Europe, the lines are harder to draw between
professional divisions among logicians. Some European journals,
especially the <em>Journal of Logic, Language, and Information</em>
and <em>Studia Logica</em>, are successful in maintaining a focus in
logic while attracting authors from all the disciplines in which logic
is represented.</p>

<p>
In the final analysis, logic deals with reasoning&mdash;and relatively
little of the reasoning we do is mathematical, while almost all of the
mathematical reasoning done by nonmathematicians is mere calculation.
To have scope as well as rigor, logic needs to maintain itself as a
single discipline, uniting its mathematical and philosophical side.
But the needs of Computer Science have added strong unifying motives
for this unification, providing a novel methodology and relations to
new, rewarding applications.</p>

<h2 id="JohnMcCaCommLogi">2. John McCarthy and Commonsense Logicism</h2>

<h3 id="LogiAI">2.1 Logic and AI</h3>

<p>
John McCarthy was, and remains, the most influential figure in logical
AI. McCarthy was one of the founders of AI, and consistently advocated
logical formalization as the path to human-level AI. All but the most
recent work in McCarthy&rsquo;s research program can be found in
 <a href="#lifschitz:1990c">Lifschitz 1990a</a>,
 which also contains
 <a href="#lifschitz:1990d">Lifschitz 1990b</a>,
 an introduction to McCarthy&rsquo;s work. For additional historical
background, see
 <a href="#israel_d:1991a">Israel 1991</a>.</p>
 
<p>
McCarthy&rsquo;s views were first articulated in
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1:1959a1">McCarthy 1959</a>
 and elaborated and amended in
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1-hayes_pj1:1969a1">McCarthy &amp; Hayes 1969</a>.
 He felt that even if AI implementations do not straightforwardly use
logical reasoning techniques like theorem proving, a logical
formalization will help to understand the reasoning problem itself.
The claim is that without a logical account of the reasoning domain,
it will not be possible to implement the reasoning itself. This is in
fact controversial. Many AI researchers see no need for logical
formalization in their work. For instance, the products of machine
learning will typically bear no discernible relation to logic, and
depend on a combination of training corpora and cumulative learning
experience. There will be no obvious way to characterize or understand
them at a declarative, conceptual level, and their relation to logic
will be problematic.</p>

<p>
The recommendations of
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1-hayes_pj1:1969a1">McCarthy &amp; Hayes 1969</a>,
 overlap to a large extent with those of analytic philosophy, but are
directed at a different goal: programmable general intelligence rather
than conceptual analysis. Similar goals have occurred to a few
philosophers; see, for instance,

Assuming that most readers of this article will be interested in the
relation between logical AI and philosophical logic, the remainder of
this article will ignore relations both to philosophy in general and
to the feasibility of developing human-level intelligent systems.</p>

<h3 id="FormCommSens">2.2 The Formalization of Common Sense</h3>

<p>
McCarthy&rsquo;s long-term objective was to formalize <em>commonsense
reasoning</em>, the prescientific reasoning that engages human
thinking about everyday problems. We have mentioned a planning
problem: how to get to the airport. Other examples include:</p>

<ol>

<li><em>Narrative understanding.</em> The reasoning involved in
reconstructing implicit information from narratives, such as
sequencing of eventualities, and inferred causal connections.</li>

<li><em>Diagnosis.</em> For instance, explaining faults in physical
devices on the basis of observations.</li>

<li><em>Spatial Reasoning.</em> For instance, reasoning about the
parts of rigid bodies and their shapes, and their relation to the
shape of the whole.</li>

<li><em>Reasoning about the attitudes of other agents.</em> For
instance, making informed guesses about the beliefs and desires of
other agents, either from &ldquo;keyhole observation&rdquo; or from
conversational clues of the sort that could be obtained in a brief,
interactive interview.</li>
</ol>

<p>
McCarthy&rsquo;s goal will probably seem outrageous to most philosophers,
who are trained to think of common sense as elusive and incoherent.
But philosophers invoke common sense in relation to philosophical
disputes, where its employment is problematic. McCarthy was thinking
of everyday, practical common sense. We couldn&rsquo;t manage to navigate
simple daily tasks if common sense were not reliable in these
settings. Formalizing the reasoning that supports these tasks may turn
out to be impracticable, but the project itself is neither misguided
nor quixotic.</p>

<p>
Whether or not formalization is the secret to human-level AI, it has
been successful on a smaller-scale&mdash;not only in unembodied
 settings<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
 but in online robot planning and execution. It is used in some
approaches to complete, autonomous
 agents.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>.
 It plays an important role in multiagent systems, where communicating
and reasoning about knowledge are
 critical.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup>
 And it has illuminated qualitative reasoning about the behavior of
physical
 devices.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h2 id="NonmReasNonmLogi">3. Nonmonotonic Reasoning and Nonmonotonic Logics</h2>

<h3 id="Nonm">3.1 Nonmonotonicity</h3>

<p>
While a mathematical proof must cover every contingency, practical
reasoning routinely closes its eyes to some possibilities. Consider a
plan to get to the airport. It could be impeded by an earthquakes, a
meteor strike, or a highway accident. But it&rsquo;s perfectly reasonable to
ignore the first two factors, and often even the third can safely be
ignored. Acceptance of a plan, unlike acceptance of a proof, is risky.
In fact, risk and the possibility of unpleasant surprises are features
of sound commonsense reasoning. This means that the reasoning is
<em>nonmonotonic</em>.</p>

<p>
Classical logics were designed with mathematics in mind and their
consequence relations are monotonic. That is, if a set \(T\) of
formulas implies a consequence \(B\) then a larger set \(T \cup \{A\}\) will also imply \(B\). A logic is nonmonotonic
if its consequence relation lacks this property. <em>Preferred
models</em> provide a general way to induce a nonmonotonic consequence
relation. Invoke a function that for each \(T\) produces a subset
\(\mathcal{M}_T\) of the models of
\(T\); in general, we will expect \(\mathcal{M}_T\) to be a proper subset
of these models. We then say that \(T\) implies \(B\) if
\(B\) is satisfied by every model in \(\mathcal{M}_T\). As long as we do not
suppose that \(\mathcal{M}_{T} \subseteq \mathcal{M}_{S}\) if
\(S \subseteq T\), the implication relation will be
nonmonotonic.</p>

<p>
Improbability is not the only reason for disregarding a contingency.
Other reasons include (1) a feeling for what is normal and usual; (2)
epistemic excusability&mdash;immunity from any blame that may attach
to ignoring a possibility; (3) the estimated costs of further
deliberation; and (4) inattention and mere cognitive laziness. Some of
these may be more &ldquo;rational&rdquo; than others, but in fact it
isn&rsquo;t easy to locate a boundary between rational and irrational
factors. And probably no one has succeeded in clarifying and
disentangling these motivating considerations. </p>

<p>
In the early stages of its development. many researchers hoped that
nonmonotonic logic would provide a general approach to efficient
reasoning about uncertainty. But by the end of the 1980s, fully
quantitative probabilistic reasoning had become not only implementable
but clearly preferable in many sorts of applications to methods
involving nonmonotonic logic. Nonmonotonicity is no magic path to
efficient reasoning. It can be useful in reasoning about uncertainty.
But so can probabilities.</p>

<h3 id="Begi">3.2 Beginnings</h3>

<p>
Three influential papers on nonmonotonic logic appeared in 1980:
<a>McDermott &amp; Doyle 1980</a>,
 <a href="#reiter_r:1980a1">Reiter 1980</a>,
 and
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1:1980a">McCarthy 1980</a>.
 In each case, the formalisms presented in these papers emerged from a
gestation period of several years or more. To set out the historical
influences accurately, it would have been necessary to interview the
authors, and this has not been done. However, there seem to have been
two motivating factors: strategic considerations having to do with the
long-range goals of AI, and much more specific, tactical
considerations arising from the analysis of the reasoning systems that
were being deployed in the 1970s.</p>

<p>

 <a href="#Nonm">Section 3.1</a>
 explained why if was generally felt that monotonicity renders
classical logics unsuitable as a vehicle for formalizing commonsense
reasoning.
 <a href="#minsky:1974a1">Minsky 1974</a>,
 which was widely read at the time of its publication, helped to
crystalize this attitude. Minsky&rsquo;s paper presents an assortment of
challenges for AI, focusing at the outset on the problem of natural
language
 understanding.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>
 He advocates &ldquo;frame-based&rdquo; knowledge representation
 techniques<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup>
 and (conceiving these as an alternative to logic), he throws out a
number of loosely connected challenges for the logical approach,
including the following problems: building large-scale
representations, reasoning efficiently, representing control
knowledge, and providing for the flexible revision of defeasible
beliefs. In retrospect, most AI researchers would likely agree that
these problems are quite general challenges to any research program
(including the one Minsky himself advocated at the time) and would add
that logical techniques are an important element in addressing some,
perhaps all, of the issues. For instance, a well structured logical
design can be a great help in scaling up any computationally useful
body of knowledge.</p>

<p>
Perhaps unintentionally, Minsky&rsquo;s paper incentivized
nonmonotonic logicians by identifying monotonicity as a source of the
alleged shortcomings of logic. Although Minsky apparently meant to
discredit logical methods in AI,
 <a href="#mcdermott_d-doyle_j:1980a">McDermott &amp; Doyle 1980</a>
 and
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1:1980a">McCarthy 1980</a>
 interpret his criticisms as a challenge to be met by developing
logics that lack the monotonicity property.</p>

<p>
The development of nonmonotonic logic also owes much to the needs of
AI applications. In fact, this influence was at least as persuasive as
McCarthy&rsquo;s strategic considerations, and in many ways more
influential on the shape of the formalisms that emerged. Here, we
mention three applications that appear to have been important for some
of the early nonmonotonic logicians: belief revision, closed-world
reasoning, and planning.</p>

<h4>3.2.1 Belief Revision</h4>

<p> 
 <a href="#doyle_j:1979b1">Doyle 1979</a>
 presents a &ldquo;truth maintenance system.&rdquo; Doyle&rsquo;s truth
maintenance algorithm answered a general need, providing a mechanism
for updating the &ldquo;beliefs&rdquo; of a knowledge repository. The
idea is to keep track of the support of beliefs, and to use the record
of these support dependencies when it is necessary to revise beliefs.</p>

<p>
In a TMS, part of the support for a belief can consist in the
<em>absence</em> of some other belief. This introduces
nonmonotonicity. For instance, it provides for defaults: beliefs that
are induced by the absence of contrary beliefs.</p>

<p>
The TMS algorithm and its refinements had a significant impact on AI
applications, and this created the need for a logical analysis. (In
even fairly simple cases, it can be hard in the absence of analytic
tools to see what consequences a TMS should deliver.) This presented a
natural and highly specific challenge for those seeking to develop a
nonmonotonic logic. The TMS also provided the idea that
nonmonotonicity has to do with inferences based on unprovability; this
insight was important for modal approaches to nonmonotonic logic and
for default logic. And the TMS&rsquo;s emphasis on interactions
between arguments initiated a theme in nonmonotonic logic that remains
important to this day. <em>Abstract argumentation</em> is a framework
for default reasoning with connections to logic programming that
continues to receive much attention. See, for instance,
 <a href="#besnard_p-hunter_a:2008a">Besnard &amp; Hunter 2008</a>
 and
 <a href="#rahwan-simari:2009a">Rahwan &amp; Simari 2009</a>.</p>
 
<h4>3.2.2 Closed-world reasoning</h4>

<p>
The study of databases in computer science has a logical side; see
 <a href="#minker:1997a">Minker 1997</a>
 for a survey. This area has interacted with logical AI. The deductive
database paradigm was taking shape at about the same time that many AI
researchers were thinking through the problems of nonmonotonic logic,
and provided several specific examples of nonmonotonic reasoning that
called for analysis. Of these, perhaps the most important is the
<em>closed-world assumption</em>. According to this
assumption&mdash;at least as far as simple claims (i.e. positive or
negative literals) are concerned&mdash;the system assumes that it
knows all that there is to be known. It is the closed world assumption
that justifies a negative answer to a query &ldquo;Is there a direct
flight from Detroit to Bologna?&rdquo; when the system finds no such
flight in its data. This is another case of inference from the absence
of a proof. A negative is proved, in effect, by the failure of a
systematic attempt to prove the positive. This idea, which was
investigated in papers such as
 <a href="#reiter_r:1978a1">Reiter 1978</a>
 and
 <a href="#clark_kl:1978a1">Clark 1978</a>,
 provided a well-defined challenge for nonmonotonic logicians, as well
as suggestions about how to address the challenge. </p>

<h4>3.2.3 Planning</h4>

<p>
Rational planning is impossible without the ability to reason about
the outcomes of a series of contemplated actions. Predictive reasoning
of this sort is local; in a complex world with many dynamic variables,
we assume that most of these will be unchanged by the performance of
an action. The problem of how to formalize such &ldquo;causal
inertia&rdquo; is known as the <em>frame problem</em>. </p>

<p>
It is very natural to suppose that inertia holds by default&mdash;that
variables are unchanged by the performance of an action unless there
is a special reason to think that they will change. This suggests that
nonmonotonic temporal formalisms should apply usefully to reasoning
about action and change, and in particular might address the frame
problem.
 <a href="#sandewall:1972a">Sandewall 1972</a>,
 is an early attempt along these lines. Later work in this direction
provides an especially important and instructive case study of the use
of logic in AI; see
 <a href="#PredFramProb">Section 4.4</a>,
 for further discussion.</p>

<h3 id="EarlForm">3.3 The Earliest Formalisms</h3>

<p>

 <a href="#Begi">Section 3.2</a>
 mentioned three influential approaches to nonmonotonic logic:
<em>circumscription</em> (McCarthy), <em>modal approaches</em> (Doyle
&amp; McDermott) and <em>default logic</em> (Reiter).</p>

<p>
In
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1:1993a">McCarthy 1993a</a>,
 McCarthy urged us, when considering the early history of
circumscription, to take into account a group of three papers:
McCarthy
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1:1986a1">1986</a>,
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1:1980a">1980</a>, and
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1:1977a5">1987</a>.
 The first paper connects the strategic ideas of
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1-hayes_pj1:1969a1">McCarthy &amp; Hayes 1969</a>
 with the need for a nonmonotonic logic, and sketches the logical
ideas of <em>domain circumscription</em>, the simplest case of
circumscription. The second paper provides more thorough logical
foundations, and introduces the more general and powerful
<em>predicate circumscription</em> approach. The third paper discusses
challenging commonsense examples and techniques for formalizing
them.</p>

<p>
All forms of circumscription involve restricting attention to models
in which certain sets are minimized; for this reason, circumscription
can be grouped with the preferred models treatments of
nonmonotonicity. McCarthy&rsquo;s approach is conservative: it uses
classical second-order logic. Therefore the circumscription literature
can avoid logical foundations and concentrate on formalizations. The
other varieties of nonmonotonic logic, including default logic and the
modal nonmonotonic logics, raise issues that will seem familiar to
philosophical logicians. These have to do with the design of new
logics, the systematic investigation of questions concerning validity,
and managing the proliferation of alternative logics.</p>

<p>
It is natural to think of nonmonotonic inferences as being
<em>hedged</em>. That is, a nonmonotonic inference may require not
merely the presence of proved conclusions, but the <em>absence</em> of
other conclusions. The general form of such a default rule is:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag4em">
<dt>\(\textbf{DR}\):</dt>
<dd>In the presence of
\(\{A_1 ,\ldots ,A_n\}\) and in the
absence of \(\{B_1 ,\ldots ,B_m\}\),
conclude \(C\).
<br />
We write such a rule as \(A_1 ,\ldots ,A_n\) ;
\(B_1 ,\ldots ,B_m \leadsto C\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
An important special case of \(\mathbf{DR}\) is a <em>normal
default</em>, a simple rule to the effect that \(C\) holds by
default, conditionally on assumptions
\(A_1 ,\ldots ,A_n\). This can be
formalized by taking the negation of the conclusion itself to be what
must be absent.</p>

<dl class="sentag tag4em">
<dt>\(\mathbf{NDR}\):</dt>
<dd>In the presence of
\(\{A_1 ,\ldots ,A_n\}\) and in the
absence of \(\neg C\), conclude \(C\), written as
\(A_1 ,\ldots ,A_n \leadsto C\).
<br />
The special case stipulating that a conclusion \(C\) holds by
default is  \(\top \leadsto C\) or simply \(\leadsto C\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
A <em>default theory</em> consists of two components: a set of
formulas taken as axioms, and a set of default rules.</p>

<p>
At first sight, it is perplexing how to characterize proofs in default
logic, because the default account of provability is circular: proofs
are defined in terms of chains of correct inferences, but correct
inference is defined in terms of (non)provability. Therefore
provability can&rsquo;t be characterized inductively,, as in the
monotonic case. The early theory of
 <a href="#sandewall:1972a">Sandewall 1972</a>
 didn&rsquo;t address this difficulty successfully.
 <a href="#mcdermott_d-doyle_j:1980a">McDermott &amp; Doyle 1980</a>
 and
 <a href="#reiter_r:1980a1">Reiter 1980</a>
 propose solutions to this problem. In both cases, the logical task is
(1) to develop a formalism in which rules like \(\mathbf{DR}\) can
be expressed, and (2) to define the relation between a combination
\(DT\) of nonmonotonic axioms and rules and the theories
\(E\) which could count as reasonable consequences of
\(DT\). In the terminology that later became standard, we need to
define the relation between a default theory \(DT\) and its
<em>extensions</em>.</p>

<p>
This is a radical departure from classical logic, which associates a
single collection of consequences with an axiomatic basis. A default
theory can determine many alternative consequence sets, with the logic
itself providing no way to choose between them. </p>

<p>
In retrospect, we can identify two approaches to nonmonotonic logic:
those based on <em>preference</em> and those based on
<em>conflict</em>. Theories of the first sort (like circumscription)
involve a relatively straightforward modification of the ordinary
model-theoretic definition of logical consequence, appealing to a
preference relation over models. Theories of the second sort (like
default logic) require a more radical reworking of logical ideas. The
possibility of multiple extensions&mdash;different possible coherent,
inferentially complete conclusion sets that can be drawn from a single
set of premises&mdash;means that we have to think of logical
consequence not as a function taking a set of axioms into its logical
closure, but as a <em>relation</em> between a set of axioms and
alternative logical closures. Since logical consequence is so
fundamental, this represents a major theoretical departure. With
multiple extensions, we can still retrieve a consequence relation
between a theory and a formula in various ways, the simplest being to
say that \(DT\) nonmonotonically implies \(C\) if \(C\)
is a member of every extension of \(DT\). Still, the
conflict-based account of consequence provides a much richer
underlying structure than the preferential one.</p>

<p>
Reiter approaches the formalization problem conservatively. The
language of default logic is the same as the language of first-order
logic and its formulas cannot express defaults. But a theory may
involve a set of <em>default rules</em>&mdash;rules of the form
\(\mathbf{DR}\). A <em>default theory</em>, then, is a pair
\(\text{DT}=\langle W,D\rangle\) consisting of a set \(W\) of
(monotonic) axioms and a set \(D\) of default rules.
 <a href="#reiter_r:1980a1">Reiter 1980</a>
 provides a fixpoint definition of the extensions of such a theory,
and develops the theoretical groundwork for the approach, proving a
number of the basic theorems.</p>

<p>
Of these theorems, we mention one in particular, which will be used in
 <a href="#NonmTreaInerPackProb">Section 4.5</a>,
 in connection with the Yale Shooting Anomaly. The idea is to take a
conjectured extension (which will be a set \(T^*\)) and to use
this set for consistency checks in a proof-like process that
successively applies default rules in \(\langle W,D\rangle\) to
stages that begin with \(W\).</p>

<p>
We define a default proof process \(T_0,T_1,\ldots\) for \(\langle
W,D\rangle\), relative to \(T^*\), as follows.</p>

<ul>

<li>Let \(T_0 = W\).</li>

<li>If no default rule in \(D\) is nonvacuously applicable to
\(T_i\) relative to \(T^*\), then
\(T_{i+1} =
\text{Th}_{\text{\small{FOL}}}(T_i)\), the
logical closure in
<br />
FOL of \(T_i\).</li>

<li>Otherwise, choose some default rule \(A\) ;
\(B_1 ,\ldots ,B_m\leadsto C\) that is nonvacuously applicable to
\(T_i\) relative to \(T^*\), and let
<br />
\(T_{i+1} = \text{Th}_{\text{\small{FOL}}}(T_i\cup \{C\})\).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
In other words, as long as we can nonvacuously close the stage we are
working on under an applicable default, we do so; otherwise, we do
nothing. A theorem of Reiter&rsquo;s says that, under these
circumstances: </p>

<blockquote>
\(T\) is an extension of \(\langle W, D\rangle\) if and
only if there is a proof process \(T_0,
T_1,\ldots\) for \(W, D\), relative
to \(T\), such that \(T =\bigcup\{T_i :0\le i\}\).
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, we can show that \(T\) is an extension by (1) constructing
a default reasoning process \(\{T_i\}\) from
\(\langle W, D\rangle\) that uses \(T\) for consistency
checks, (2) taking the limit \(T'\) of this process, and
(3) verifying that in fact \(T' = T.\) </p>

<p>
The modal approach invokes a modal operator \(L\), informally
interpreted as
 &lsquo;provable&rsquo;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>
 The essence of McDermott and Doyle&rsquo;s approach, like
Reiter&rsquo;s, is a fixpoint definition of the extensions of a
nonmonotonic logic. Incorporating nonmonotonicity in the object
language creates some additional complexities, which in the early
modal approach show up mainly in proliferation of the logics and
difficulties in evaluating the merits of the alternatives. As better
foundations for the modal account emerged, it became possible to
prove, as was expected, the equivalence of the modal and default logic
 approaches.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Unlike other early presentations of nonmonotonic logic, Reiter&rsquo;s
shows specific influence from earlier and independent work on
nonmonotonicity in logic programming&mdash;the work seems to have been
largely inspired by the need to provide logical foundations for the
nonmonotonic reasoning found in deductive databases. The subsequent
history of nonomonotonic logic is intimately connected with the
literature on logic programming semantics.</p>

<p>
Doyle and McDermott&rsquo;s paper cites the earlier literature in
logicist AI, presenting nonmonotonic logic as part of a program of
formalizing commonsense rationality. But this work is also clearly
influenced by the need to provide a formal account of truth
maintenance.</p>

<h3 id="LateWorkNonmLogi">3.4 Later Work in Nonmonotonic Logic</h3>

<p>
Nonmonotonic logic is a complex, robust research field. Providing a
survey of the subject is made difficult by the fact that there are
many different foundational paradigms for formalizing nonmonotonic
reasoning, and the relations between these paradigms is not simple. An
adequate account of even a significant part of the field requires a
something like a book-length treatment. A number of books and handbook
articles are available, including

 is a useful source for readers interested in the early history of the
subject, and has an excellent introduction. </p>

<h4>3.4.1 Preference Semantics</h4>

<p>

 <a href="#Nonm">Section 3.1</a>
 explained how preferred models can be used to characterize a
nonmonotonic consequence relation. This approach to the model theory
of nonmonotonicity was clarified in
 <a href="#shoham:1988a">Shoham 1988</a>,
 five years after the work discussed in
 <a href="#Begi">Section 3.2</a>.
 Shoham&rsquo;s work provides a more general and abstract approach. </p>

<p>
Preferential semantics relies on a function \(S\) taking a set
\(K\) of models into a subset \(S(K)\) of
\(K\). The crucial definition of <em>preferential entailment</em>
stipulates that \(A\) is a (nonmonotonic) consequence of
\(T\) if every model \(M\) of
\(S\)(<em>Models</em>\((T))\) implies \(A\). Shoham
characterizes \(S(K)\) in terms of a partial order
\(\preccurlyeq\) over models: \(S(K)\) is the set of models in
\(K\) that are \(\preccurlyeq\)-minimal in \(K\). To ensure that no
set can preferentially entail a contradiction unless it classically
entails a contradiction, infinite descending \(\preccurlyeq\) chains must be
disallowed.</p>

<p>
This treatment of nonmonotonicity is similar to the earlier modal
semantic theories of conditionals&mdash;the similarities are
particularly evident using presentations of conditional semantics such
as
 <a href="#chellas:1975a">Chellas 1975</a>
 that associate a set of worlds with the antecedent. Of course, the
consequence relation of the classical conditional logics is monotonic,
and conditional semantics uses possible worlds, not models. But the
<em>left-nonmonotonicity</em> of conditionals (the fact that
\(A\,\Box{\rightarrow}\,C\) does not imply
\([A\wedge B]\,\Box{\rightarrow}\,C)\) creates issues
that parallel those that arise from a nonmonotonic consequence
relation. Interrelations between conditionals and nonmonotonic logic
became an important theme in later work in nonmonotonic logic. See,
for instance,
 <a href="#gardenfors-makinson:1994a">G&auml;rdenfors &amp; Makinson 1994</a>,

<p>
Preference semantics raises an opportunity for formulating and proving
representation theorems relating conditions over preference relations
to properties of the abstract consequence relation. This line of
investigation began with
 <a href="#lehmann_d-magidor:1992b1">Lehmann &amp; Magidor 1992</a>.</p>
 
<h4>3.4.2 Modal and epistemic theories</h4>

<p>
Neither Doyle nor McDermott pursued the modal approach much beyond the
initial stages. With a helpful suggestion from Robert Stalnaker (see
 <a href="#stalnaker:1993c">Stalnaker 1993</a>),
 however, Robert C. Moore produced a modal theory that improves in
many ways on the earlier ideas. Moore gives the modal operator of his
system an epistemic interpretation, based on the conception of a
default rule as one that licenses a conclusion for a reasoning agent
unless something that the agent knows blocks the conclusion. In
Moore&rsquo;s <em>autoepistemic logic</em>, an extension \(E\) of
a theory \(T\) is a superset of \(T\) that is
<em>stable</em>, i.e., that is deductively closed, and that satisfies
the following two rules:</p>

<ol>

<li>If \(A\in E\) then
\(\Box A\in E\).</li>

<li>If \(A\not\in E\) then
\(\neg \Box A\in E\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
It is also usual to impose a <em>groundedness</em> condition on
autoepistemic extensions of \(T\), ensuring that every member of
an extension has some reason tracing back to \(T\). Various such
conditions have been considered; the simplest one restricts extensions
to those satisfying </p>

<ol start="3">

<li>\(E\) is the set of nonmodal consequences of
\(T\cup \{A : \Box A\in E\} \cup \{\neg \Box A : A\not\in E\}\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Autoepistemic logic remains a popular approach to nonmonotonic logic,
in part because of its usefulness in providing theoretical foundations
for logic programming. See
 <a href="#marek-truszcynski:1991a">Marek &amp; Truszczynski 1991</a>,

<p>
Epistemic logic has inspired other approaches to nonmonotonic logic.
Like other modal theories of nonmonotonicity, these use modality to
reflect consistency in the object language, and so allow default rules
along the lines of \(\mathbf{DR}\) to be expressed. But instead of
consistency, these use <em>ignorance</em>. See

compared to other nonmonotonic logics in
 <a href="#meyer_jjc-vanderhoek:1995a">Meyer &amp; van der Hoek 1995</a>.

<h2 id="ReasAbouActiChan">4. Reasoning about Action and Change</h2>

<h3 id="PrioTensLogi">4.1 Priorian Tense Logic</h3>

<p>
The contours of modern temporal logic were standardized by Arthur
Prior during the 1950s and 1960s: see Prior
 <a href="#prior:1956b">1956</a>,
 <a href="#prior:1967a">1967</a>,
 <a href="#prior:1968a">1968</a>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup>
As it
was developed in philosophical logic, tense logic proved to be a
species of modal logic. Thus, it relativizes the truth-values of
formulas to <em>world-states</em> or temporal stages of the world;
these are the tense-theoretic analogues of the timeless possible
worlds of ordinary modal logic. A research program can then be
borrowed from modal logic&mdash;for instance, working out the
relations between axiomatic systems and the corresponding model
theoretic constraints on temporal orderings. See, for instance,
 <a href="#burgess_jp:1984c">Burgess 1984</a>
 and
 <a href="#vanbenthem:1983a">van Benthem 1983</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Priorian tense logic shares with modal logic an interest in using the
first-order theory of relations to explain the logical phenomena, an
expectation that the important temporal operators will be quantifiers
over world-states, and a rather tenuous connection to realistic,
practical specimens of temporal reasoning. Of course, these temporal
logics do yield validities, such as</p>

\[A\rightarrow\textit{PFA}
\]

<p>
(if \(A\), then it was the case that \(A\) was going to be
the case), which certainly are intuitively valid. But at most, these
can only play a broadly foundational role in accounting for
commonsense reasoning about time. It is hard to think of realistic
examples of reasoning in which they play a leading part. </p>

<h3 id="PlanProbSituCalc">4.2 Planning Problems and the Situation Calculus</h3>

<p>
Planning problems provide one of the most fruitful showcases for
combining logical analysis with AI applications. On the one hand
automated planning enjoys many applications of real practical value,
and on the other logical formalizations of planning are genuinely
helpful in understanding planning problems, and in designing
algorithms.</p>

<p>
The classical representation of an AI planning problem, as described
in
 <a href="#amarel:1968a1">Amarel 1968</a>,
 evidently originates in early work of Herbert Simon&rsquo;s,
published in a 1966 CMU technical report,
 <a href="#simon_ha:1966a">Simon 1966</a>.
 In such a problem, an agent in an initial world-state is equipped
with a set of <em>actions</em>, which are thought of as partial
functions transforming world-states into world-states. Actions are
feasible only in world-states that meet appropriate constraints.
(These constraints are now called the &ldquo;preconditions&rdquo; of
the action.) A planning problem then becomes a search for a series of
feasible actions that successively transform the initial world-state
into a desired world-state.</p>

<p>
The <em>Situation Calculus</em>, developed by John McCarthy, is the
origin of most of the later work in formalizing reasoning about action
and change. It was first described in 1969, the earliest generally
accessible publication on the topic is
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1-hayes_pj1:1969a1">McCarthy &amp; Hayes 1969</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Apparently, Priorian tense logic had no influence on Amarel. But there
is no important difference between Amarel&rsquo;s world-states and
those of Priorian tense logic. The &ldquo;situations&rdquo; of the
Situation Calculus are these same world-states, under a new
 name.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup>
 They resemble possible worlds in modal logic in providing abstract
locations that support a consistent and complete collection of truths.
As in tense logic, these locations are ordered, and change is
represented by variations in truth conditions from one location to
another. The differences, of course, are inspired by the intended use
of the Situation Calculus: it is meant to formalize Simon&rsquo;s
representation of the planning problem, in which a single agent
reasons about scenarios in which sequential actions are
 performed.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-16" id="ref-16">16</a>]</sup>
 Change in the situation calculus is dynamic, driven by the
performance of actions. Therefore the fundamental model theoretic
component is</p>

\[
\sc{Result}(\ra,\rs,\rs'),
\]

<p>
the relation between an action a, an input situation s in which a is
performed, and an output situation \(\rs'\) immediately subsequent to
the performance of the action. Usually (though this is not absolutely
necessary) the deterministic assumption is made that \(\rs'\) is
unique.</p>

<p>
All this, of course, presupposes a discrete picture of time. As in
other action-driven frameworks, such ss game theory and the theory of
digital computation, such a picture appears to be indispensible. </p>

<p>
In general, actions can be successfully performed only under certain
limited circumstances. This could be modeled by allowing for cases in
which there is no \(\rs'\) such that
\(\sc{Result}(\ra,\rs,\rs')\). Often, however, it is assumed
that \(\sc{Result}\) is in fact a total function, but that in
cases in which s does not meet the &ldquo;preconditions&rdquo; of a,
there are no restrictions on the \(\rs'\) satisfying
\(\sc{Result}(\ra,\rs,\rs')\). This means that the causal
effects of a will be entirely unconstrained in such cases, and in the
presence of inertial laws &ldquo;performing&rdquo; a will leave things
unchanged. </p>

<p>
A planning problem starts with a limited repertoire of actions (where
preconditions and effects are associated with each action), an initial
situation, and a goal (which can be treated as a formula). A planning
problem is a matter of finding a sequence of actions that will achieve
the goal, given the initial situation. That is, given a goal
\(G\) and initial situation s, the problem will consist of
finding a sequence \(\ra_1, \ldots,\ra_n\) of actions which
will transform s into a final situation \(\rs_n\) that satisfies
\(G\). The planning problem is in effect a search for such a
sequence of actions. The success conditions for the search can be
characterized in a formalism like the Situation Calculus, which allows
information about the results of actions to be expressed.</p>

<p>
Nothing has been said up till now about the actual language of the
Situation Calculus. The crucial thing is how change is to be
expressed. With tense logic in mind, it would be natural to invoke a
modality like \([a]A\), with the truth condition</p>

\[
\vDash_{\small{s}}[a]A
\text{ iff }
\vDash_{\small{\rs'}}A, \text{ where }
\vDash \sc{Result}(\ra,\rs)=\rs'.
\]

<p>
This formalization, in the style of dynamic logic, is in fact an
attractive alternative to McCarthy&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>
But
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1-hayes_pj1:1969a1">McCarthy &amp; Hayes 1969</a>
 deploys a language that is much closer to first-order logic. (This
formalization style is characteristic of McCarthy&rsquo;s work; see
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1:1979c1">McCarthy 1979</a>.)
 Actions are treated as individuals. And propositions whose truth
values can change over time (propositional <em>fluents</em>) are also
treated as individuals. Where \(s\) denotes a situation and
\(f\) a fluent, \(\Holds(f,\rs)\)
says that \(f\)
is true in \(\rs\).</p>

<h3 id="FormMicr">4.3 Formalizing Microworlds</h3>

<p>
Since the pioneering work of the nineteenth and early twentieth
century logicians, the process of formalizing mathematical domains has
become routine. Although (as with set theory) there may be
controversies about what axioms and logical infrastructure best serve
to formalize an area of mathematics, the methods of formalization and
the criteria for evaluating them are automatic and (mostly)
unexamined. This methodological clarity has not been successfully
extended to other domains; even the formalization of the empirical
sciences presents difficult problems that have not yet been
 resolved.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-17" id="ref-17">17</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The formalization of temporal reasoning, and in particular of
reasoning about actions and plans, is the best-developed successful
extension of modern formalization techniques to domains other than
mathematical theories. This departure has required the creation of new
methodologies. One methodological innovation will emerge in
 <a href="#NonmTreaInerPackProb">Section 4.5</a>:
 the development of a library of scenarios for testing the adequacy of
various formalisms, and the creation of specialized domains like the
blocks-world domain (mentioned above, in 
 <a href="#PlanProbSituCalc">Section 4.2</a>) that serve a
laboratories for testing ideas. For more on the blocks world, see
 <a href="#genesereth-nilsson_nj:1987a">Genesereth &amp; Nilsson 1987</a>;
 <a href="#davis_e:1991a">Davis 1991</a>. McCarthy&rsquo;s ideas about <em>elaboration
tolerance</em>
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1:1999a">McCarthy 1999</a>
 provide one interesting attempt to provide a criterion for the
adequacy of formalizations. Another idea that has emerged in the
course of formalizing commonsense domains is the importance of an
explicit ontology; see, for instance,
 <a href="#fikes:1996a">Fikes 1996</a>
 and
 <a href="#lenat-guha:1989a">Lenat &amp; Guha 1989</a>.
 Another is the potential usefulness of explicit representations of
context; see
 <a href="#guha:1991a">Guha, 1991</a>.
 Another is the use of simulation techniques: see, for instance,
 <a href="#johnstone-williamson:2007">Johnstone &amp; Williamson 2007</a>.
 </p>

<h3 id="PredFramProb">4.4 Prediction and the Frame Problem</h3>

<p>
To tell whether a plan achieves its goal, you need to see whether the
goal holds in the plan&rsquo;s final state. Doing this requires
<em>predictive</em> reasoning, a type of reasoning that the
tense-logical literature neglected. As in mechanics, prediction
involves the inference of later states from earlier ones. But (in the
case of simple planning problems at least) change is driven by actions
rather than by differential equations. The investigation of this
qualitative form of temporal reasoning, and of related sorts of
reasoning (e.g., plan recognition, which seeks to infer goals from
observed actions, and narrative explanation, which seeks to fill in
implicit information in a temporal narrative) is one of the most
impressive chapters in the brief history of commonsense logicism.</p>

<p>
The essence of prediction is the problem of inferring what holds in
the situation that ensues from performing an action, given information
about the initial situation. The problem is much easier if the agent
has complete knowledge about the initial situation&mdash;this
assumption is often unrealistic, but was usual in the classical
planning
 formalisms.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-18" id="ref-18">18</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
A large part of action-driven dynamics has to do with what does
<em>not</em> change. Take a simple plan to type &lsquo;cat&rsquo;
using a word processor: the natural plan is to first enter
&lsquo;c&rsquo;, then enter &lsquo;a&rsquo;, then enter
&lsquo;t&rsquo;. Part of one&rsquo;s confidence in this plan is that
the actions are independent: for instance, entering &lsquo;a&rsquo;
does not also erase the &lsquo;c&rsquo;. The required inference can be
thought of as a form of <em>inertia</em>. The <em>Frame Problem</em>
is the problem of how to formalize the required inertial
reasoning.</p>

<p>
The Frame Problem was named and introduced in <a>McCarthy &amp; Hayes
1969</a>. Unlike most of the philosophically interesting technical
problems to emerge in AI, it has attracted the interest of
philosophers; most of the relevant papers, and background information,
can be found in
 <a href="#ford-pylyshyn:1996a">Ford &amp; Pylyshyn 1996</a>
 and
 <a href="#pylyshyn:1987a">Pylyshyn 1987</a>.
 Both of these volumes document interactions between AI and
philosophy.</p>

<p>
The quality of these interactions is discouraging. Like any realistic
commonsense reasoning problem, the Frame Problem is open-ended, and
can depend on a wide variety of circumstances. If you put $20 in a
wallet, put the wallet in your pocket, and go to the store, you can
safely assume that the $20 will remain in the wallet. But if you leave
the $20 on the counter at the store while shopping, you can&rsquo;t
safely expect it to be there later. This may account for the
temptation that makes some
 philosophers<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-19" id="ref-19">19</a>]</sup>
 want to construe the Frame Problem very broadly, so that very soon it
becomes indiscernible from the problem of formalizing general common
sense in arbitrary
 domains.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-20" id="ref-20">20</a>]</sup>
 Such a broad construal may serve to introduce speculative discussions
concerning the nature of AI, but it loses all contact with the
genuine, new logical problems in temporal reasoning that have been
discovered by the AI community. </p>

<p>
The purely logical Frame Problem can be solved using monotonic logic,
by simply writing explicit axioms stating what does <em>not</em>
change when an action is performed. This technique can be successfully
applied to quite complex formalization
 problems.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-21" id="ref-21">21</a>]</sup>
 But <em>nonmonotonic</em> solutions to the framework have been
extensively investigated and deployed; these lead to new and
interesting lines of logical development.</p>

<p>
Some philosophers
 (<a href="#fodor_ja:1987b">Fodor 1987</a>,
 <a href="#lormand:1996a">Lormand 1996</a>) have felt that contrived propositions will pose special
difficulties in connection with the Frame Problem. As Shanahan points
out
 <a href="#shanahan:1997a">Shanahan 1997</a>
 [p. 24]) Fodor&rsquo;s &ldquo;fridgeon&rdquo; example is readily
formalized in the Situation Calculus and poses no special problems.
However, as Lormand suggests, Goodman&rsquo;s examples
 <a href="#goodman_n:1946a">Goodman, 1946</a>
 do create problems if they are admitted as fluents; there will be
anomalous extensions in which objects change from green to blue in
order to preserve their grueness.</p>

<p>
This is one of the few points made by philosophers about the Frame
Problem that raises a genuine difficulty for AI formalization. But the
difficulty is peripheral, because the example is unrealistic. Closure
properties (such as closure under boolean operations) are not assumed
for fluents. In fact, it is generally supposed that the fluents chosen
in formalizing a planning domain will represent a very limited subset
of the totality of state-dependent functions; typically, it will be a
relatively small finite set of variables, representing features of the
domain considered to be important. In particular cases these will be
chosen in much the same way that a set of variables is chosen in
statistical modeling.</p>

<p>
I don&rsquo;t know of any systematic account in the AI literature of
formalization methodology, or, in particular, of how to choose an
appropriate set of fluents. But it would certainly be part of such an
account that all fluents should correspond to projectable predicates,
in Goodman&rsquo;s sense.</p>

<h3 id="NonmTreaInerPackProb">4.5 Nonmonotonic Treatments of Inertia and a Package of Problems</h3>

<p>
Nonmonotonic solutions to the Frame Problem make inertia a default;
changes are assumed to occur only if there is some special reason for
them to occur. In action-centered accounts of change, these special
reasons are found in axioms specifying the immediate effects of
actions.</p>

<p>
We can illustrate the formalization with Reiter&rsquo;s default logic.
Recall that in Reiter&rsquo;s theory, defaults are represented as
rules, not as axioms; this means that we need to use default rule
schemata to formalize inertia. For each fluent, action, and situation,
the inertia schema will include the following rule:</p>

\[\tag*{\textbf{Inertia:}}
\leadsto \Holds(f,s) \leftrightarrow \Holds(f, \ttResult(a, s))
\]

<p>
This way of doing things makes any change in the truth value of a
fluent a <em>prima facie</em> anomaly. But it follows from
Reiter&rsquo;s account of extensions that such defaults are overridden
when they conflict with the (monotonic) axioms giving the state
dynamics. If, for instance, there is a monotonic causal axiom for the
action move-P4-to-Q4 ensuring that moving a certain pawn to Q4 will
locate the pawn at Q4, the instance</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
&amp;\Holds(\mathsf{At}(\mathsf{Q2}, \mathsf{Pawn4}), \mathsf{s_0}) \\
&amp;\quad\leftrightarrow\ \Holds(\mathsf{At}(\mathsf{Q2}, \mathsf{Pawn4}),\ttResult(\mathsf{move\text{-}P4\text{-}to\text{-}Q4}, \mathsf{s_0}))
\end{aligned}\]

<p>
of \(\mathbf{IR}\) will be overridden, and there will be no
extension in which the pawn remains where it was after performing the
move-P4-to-Q4 action. <strong>Inertia</strong> will then ensure that
the other pieces stay put.</p>

<p>
The frame problem that captured wider attention was taken out of
context and in isolation. If one is interested in understanding the
philosophically interesting problems that arise in deploying
formalisms like the Situation Calculus, it is best to consider a
larger range of problems. These include not only the Frame Problem
itself, but also the Qualification Problem, the Ramification Problem,
and an assortment of specific challenges such as the scenarios
mentioned later in this section. And one has to think about how to
generalize: for instance, how to deal with incomplete information,
multiple agents acting concurrently, and continuous change in the
environment.</p>

<p>
The <em>Qualification Problem</em> arises in connection with the
formalization of just about any commonsense generalization. Typically,
these will involve an open-ended and seemingly unmanageable array of
exceptions. The same phenomenon, under the label &lsquo;the problem of
<em>ceteris paribus</em> generalizations&rsquo;, is familiar from
analytic philosophy. It also comes up in the semantics of
<em>generic</em> constructions found in natural
 languages.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-22" id="ref-22">22</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<p>
Nonmonotonic logics make a contribution to this problem by enabling
incremental formalization. If a commonsense generalization is
formulated as a default, then further qualifications can be added
nondestructively. The default axiom is retained, and an
exception&mdash;which itself may be a default&mdash;is added. This is
helpful, even if it doesn&rsquo;t address deeper problems of a philosophical
nature.</p>

<p>
The Qualification Problem was raised in
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1:1986a1">McCarthy 1986</a>,
 where it was motivated chiefly by generalizations concerning the
consequences of actions; McCarthy considered in some detail the
generalization that turning the ignition key in an automobile will
start the car. Much the same point, in fact, can be made about
virtually any action, including stacking one block on
another&mdash;the standard example used in the early days of the
Situation Calculus. A circumscriptive approach to the Qualification
Problem is presented in
 <a href="#lifschitz:1987c">Lifschitz 1987</a>;
 this explicitly introduces the relation between an action and its
preconditions into the formalism, and circumscriptively minimizes
preconditions, eliminating from preferred models any &ldquo;unknown
preconditions&rdquo; that might render an action inefficacious.</p>

<p>
Not every nonmonotonic logic provides graceful mechanisms for
qualification. Plain default logic, for instance, does not deliver the
intuitively desired conclusions because it provides no way for
defaults to override other defaults. To achieve this effect, one needs
a fancy version of the logic in which defaults are prioritized. This
can complicate the theory considerably; see, for instance,
 <a href="#asher-morreau:1991a">Asher &amp; Morreau 1991</a>
 and
 <a href="#horty:1994a">Horty 1994</a>.
 And, as
 <a href="#elkan:1995a">Elkan 1995</a>
 points out, the Qualification Problem raises computational issues.
</p>

<p>
Relatively little attention has been given to the Qualification
Problem for characterizing actions, in comparison with other problems
in temporal reasoning. In particular, the standard accounts of
<em>unsuccessful</em> actions are somewhat unintuitive. In the
formalization of
 <a href="#lifschitz:1987c">Lifschitz 1987</a>,
 for instance, actions with unsatisfied preconditions are only
distinguished from actions whose preconditions all succeed in that the
conventional effects of the action will only be ensured when the
preconditions are met. It is as if an action of spending $1,000,000
can be performed at any moment&mdash;although if you don&rsquo;t have
the money, no effects in particular will be
 guaranteed.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-23" id="ref-23">23</a>]</sup>
 And there is no distinction between actions that cannot even be
attempted (like boarding a plane in London when you are in Sydney),
actions that can be attempted, but in which the attempt can be
expected to go wrong (like making a withdrawal when you have
insufficient funds), actions that can be attempted with reasonable
hope of success, and actions that can be attempted with guaranteed
success. As J.L. Austin made clear in
 <a href="#austin:1961x">Austin 1961</a>,
 the ways in which actions can be attempted, and in which attempted
actions can fail, are a well developed part of commonsense reasoning.
Obviously, in contemplating a plan containing actions that may fail,
one may need to reason about the consequences of failure. Formalizing
the pathology of actions, providing a systematic theory of ways in
which actions and the plans that contain them can go wrong, would be a
useful addition to planning formalisms, and one that would illuminate
important themes in philosophy.</p>

<p>
The challenge posed by the <em>Ramification Problem</em>
(characterized first in
 <a href="#finger_j:1987a">Finger 1987</a>)
 is to formalize the indirect consequences of actions, where
&ldquo;indirect&rdquo; effects are
 synchronous<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-24" id="ref-24">24</a>]</sup>
 but causally derivative. If one walks into a room, the direct effect
is that one is now in the room. There are also many indirect effects:
for instance, that one&rsquo;s shirt also is now in the room.</p>

<p>
You can see from this formulation that a distinction is presupposed
between direct consequences of actions (ones that attach intrinsically
to an action and are ensured by its successful performance) and other
consequences. This assumption is generally accepted without question
in the AI literature on action formalisms. You can make a good case
for its commonsense plausibility&mdash;for instance, many of our words
for actions (&lsquo;to warm&rsquo;, &lsquo;to lengthen&rsquo;,
&lsquo;to fill&rsquo;) are derived from the effects that are
conventionally associated with them. And in these cases, success is
entailed: if someone has warmed something, this entails that it became
warm. But there are complications.
 <a href="#lin_fz:1995a">Lin 1995</a>
 discusses a simple example: a certain suitcase has two locks, and is
open if and only if both locks are open. Then (assuming that actions
are not performed concurrently) opening one lock will open the
suitcase if and only if the other lock is open. Lin&rsquo;s formalization
treats opening each lock as an action, with direct consequences. But
opening the suitcase is not an action, it is an indirect effect.</p>

<p>
Obviously, the Ramification Problem is intimately connected with the
Frame Problem. In approaches that adopt nonmonotonic solutions to the
Frame Problem, inertial defaults will need to be overridden by
ramifications in order to obtain correct results. In Lin&rsquo;s example,
suppose that the left lock of the suitcase is open and the action of
opening the right lock is performed. Then the default conclusion that
the suitcase remains closed needs somehow to be suppressed.</p>

<p>
Some approaches to the Ramification Problem depend on the development
of theories of commonsense causation and therefore are closely related
to the causal approaches to reasoning about time and action mentioned
in
 <a href="#SomeEmerFram">Section 4.6</a>.
 See, for instance,
 <a href="#giunchiglia_e-etal:1997a">Giunchiglia <em>et al</em>. 1997</a>,
 <a href="#thielscher:1997a">Thielscher 1989</a>,
 <a href="#lin_fz:1995a">Lin 1995</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Philosophical logicians have been content to illustrate their ideas
with relatively small-scale examples. The formalization of even
large-scale mathematical theories is relatively unproblematic.
Logicist AI is the first branch of logic to undertake the task of
formalizing realistic and nontrivial commonsense reasoning. In doing
so, the field has had to invent new methods. An important part of the
methodology that has emerged in formalizing action and change is the
prominence that is given to challenges, posed in the form of
<em>scenarios</em>. These scenarios represent formalization problems
which usually involve relatively simple, realistic examples designed
to challenge the logical theories in specific ways. Typically, there
will be clear commonsense intuitions about the inferences that should
be drawn in these cases. The challenge is to design a logical
formalism that will provide general, well-motivated solutions to these
benchmark problems.</p>

<p>
Among the many scenarios that have been discussed in the literature
are the Baby Scenario, the Bus Ride Scenario, the Chess Board
Scenario, the Ferryboat Connection Scenario, the Furniture Assembly
Scenario, the Hiding Turkey Scenario, the Kitchen Sink Scenario, the
Russian Turkey Scenario, the Stanford Murder Mystery, the Stockholm
Delivery Scenario, the Stolen Car Scenario, the Stuffy Room Scenario,
the Ticketed Car Scenario, the Walking Turkey Scenario, and the Yale
Shooting Anomaly. Accounts of these can be found in
 <a href="#shanahan:1997a">Shanahan 1997</a>
 and
 <a href="#sandewall:1994a">Sandewall 1994</a>;
 see especially
 <a href="#sandewall:1994a">Sandewall 1994</a>[Chapters
 2 and 7].</p>

<p>
Many of these scenarios are designed to test advanced problems that
will not be discussed here&mdash;for instance, challenges dealing with
multiple agents, or with continuous changes. Here, we concentrate on
one of the earliest, and probably the most subtle of these scenarios:
the Yale Shooting Anomaly, first reported in
 <a href="#hanks-mcdermott_d:1985a">Hanks &amp; McDermott 1985</a>
 and published in
 <a href="#hanks-mcdermott_d:1986a">Hanks &amp; McDermott 1986</a>
 and
 <a href="#hanks-mcdermott_d:1987b">Hanks &amp; McDermott 1987</a>.</p>
 
<p>
The Yale Shooting Anomaly involves three actions: load, shoot, and
wait. A propositional fluent Loaded tracks whether a certain pistol is
loaded; another fluent, Alive, tracks whether a certain turkey, Fred,
is alive. The load action has no preconditions; its only effect is
Loaded. The shoot action has Loaded as its only precondition and
Not-Alive as its only effect; the wait action has no preconditions and
no effects.</p>

<p>
Causal information regarding the axioms is formalized as follows.</p>

<table class="indent cellpad-med-dense vert-top">
<tr>
 <td> <strong>Load:</strong></td>
 <td>\(\forall s(\Holds(\Loaded, \ttResult(\load, s))\)
</td></tr>
<tr>
 <td class="nw"><strong>Shoot 1:</strong></td>
 <td> \(\forall s (\Holds(\Loaded, s)\ \rightarrow\) \(\Holds(\lnot \Alive, \ttResult(\shoot, s)))\)</td> </tr>
<tr>
 <td class="nw"><strong>Shoot 2:</strong></td>
 <td> \(\forall s (\Holds(\Loaded, s)\ \rightarrow\) \(\Holds(\lnot \Loaded, \ttResult(\shoot, s)))\)</td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
There is no Wait Axiom.</p>

<p>
We will formalize the inertial reasoning in this scenario using
Reiter&rsquo;s default logic. The set \(D\) of defaults for this
theory consists of all instances of the inertial schema
\(\mathbf{IR}\). In the initial situation, Fred is alive and the
pistol is unloaded.</p>


<table class="indent cellpad-med-dense">
<tr>
 <td> <strong>IC1:</strong></td>
 <td>\(\Holds(\Alive, s_0)\)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td><strong>IC2:</strong></td>
 <td>\(\lnot\Holds(\Loaded, s_0)\)</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The monotonic theory \(W\) of the scenario consists of: (1) the
action axioms <strong>Load</strong>, <strong>Shoot 1</strong> and
<strong>Shoot 2</strong> and (2) the initial conditions
\(\mathbf{IC1}\) and \(\mathbf{IC2}\).</p>

<p>Let \(s_1=\ttResult(\load, s_0),\) \(s_2=\ttResult(\mathsf{wait},
s_1)\), and \(s_3=\ttResult(\shoot, s_2)\).

</p>

<p>
The Yale Shooting Anomaly involves the action sequence load; wait;
shoot, passing from \(\rs_0\) to \(\rs_3\), as follows.</p>

<table class="avoid-break centered vert-bot cell-center">
<tr>
 <td>\(\rs_0\)</td>
 <td>\(\ttload\)
<br />
\(\rightarrow\)</td>
 <td>\(\rs_1\)</td>
 <td>\(\ttwait\)
<br />
\(\rightarrow\)</td>
 <td>\(\rs_2\)</td>
 <td>\(\ttshoot\)
<br />
\(\rightarrow\)</td>
 <td>\(\rs_3\)</td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
It is an anomaly&mdash;a challenge to a naive theory of
inertia&mdash;because default logic allows an extension according to
which the pistol is unloaded and Fred is alive in the final situation
\(s_3\). The anomalous extension is pictured as
follows.</p>

<table class="avoid-break cellpad-small centered vert-bot cell-center">
<tr>
 <td>\(\ttAlive\)
<br />
\(\lnot\ttLoaded\)
<br />
\(\rs_0\)</td>
 <td>\(\ttload\)
<br />
\(\rightarrow\) </td>
 <td>\(\ttAlive\)
<br />
\(\ttLoaded\)
<br />
\(\rs_1\)</td>
 <td>\(\ttwait\)
<br />
\(\rightarrow\)</td>
 <td>\(\ttAlive\)
<br />
\(\lnot\ttLoaded\)
<br />
\(\rs_2\)</td>
 <td>\(\ttshoot\)
<br />
\(\rightarrow\)</td>
 <td>\(\ttAlive\)
<br />
\(\lnot\ttLoaded\)
<br />
\(\rs_3\)</td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
In narrative form, what happens in this extension is this. At first,
Fred is alive and the pistol is unloaded. After loading, the pistol is
loaded and Fred remains alive. After waiting, the pistol becomes
unloaded and Fred remains alive. Shooting is then vacuous because the
pistol is unloaded. So finally, after shooting, Fred remains alive and
the pistol remains unloaded.</p>

<p>
The best way to see that this is an extension is to work through the
proof. Less formally, though, you can see that the expected extension
in which Fred ends up dead violates just one default: the frame
default for <span class="ss light smaller">Alive</span> is violated
when Fred changes state in the last step. But the anomalous extension
also violates only one default: the frame default for <span class="ss light smaller">Loaded</span>
is violated when the pistol spontaneously
becomes unloaded while waiting. If you just go by the number of
defaults that are violated, both extensions are equally good.</p>

<p>
A planning algorithm based on a straightforward default logic
formalization of causal inertia will be unable to perform as expected.
It will be unable to verify a perfectly reasonable commonsense plan to
kill Fred and will fail similarly in all but the simplest planning
scenarios. So the Yale Shooting Anomaly represents a major obstacle in
developing an inertia-based theory of predictive reasoning. A
plausible, well-motivated logical solution to the Frame Problem has
run afoul of a simple, crisp example in which it clearly delivers the
wrong results.</p>

<p>
Naturally, the literature concerning the Yale Shooting Anomaly is
extensive. Surveys of some of this work, with bibliographical
references, can be found in

<h3 id="SomeEmerFram">4.6 Some Emergent Frameworks</h3>

<p>
It is commonly agreed that good solutions need to perform
satisfactorily over a large suite of scenarios and to be
generalizable: in particular, they should be deployable even when
continuous time, concurrent actions, and various kinds of ignorance
are introduced. And it is agreed that they should support multiple
reasoning tasks, including not only prediction and plan verification
but explanation of historical information or a narrative in terms of
actions performed and agent goals.</p>

<p>
Here, we mention four approaches: (1) Features and fluents
(Sandewall), (2) Motivated Action Theory (Morgenstern and Stein), (3)
State Minimization in the Event Calculus (Shanahan) and (4) Causal
Theories (Lifschitz and others). The fourth approach is most likely to
be interesting to philosophers and to contain elements that will be of
lasting importance regardless of future developments in this area, and
is discussed in more detail.</p>

<h4>4.6.1 Features and fluents</h4>

<p>
This approach, described in
 <a href="#sandewall:1994a">Sandewall 1994</a>,
 uses preference semantics as a way to organize nonmonotonic solutions
to the problems of reasoning about action and change. Rather than
introducing a single logical framework, Sandewall considers a number
of temporal logics, including ones that use discrete, continuous, and
branching time. The properties of the logics are systematically tested
against a large suite of test scenarios. </p>

<h4>4.6.2 Motivated Action Theory</h4>

<p>
This theory grew out of direct consideration of the problems in
temporal reasoning described above in
 <a href="#NonmTreaInerPackProb">Section 4.5</a>,
 and especially the Yale Shooting scenario.
 <a href="#morgenstern-stein:1994a">Morgenstern &amp; Stein 1994</a>
 seeks to find a general, intuitively motivated logical framework that
solves the difficulties. Morgenstern and Stein settle on the idea that
unmotivated actions are to be minimized, where an action can be
motivated directly, e.g. by an axiom, or indirectly, through causal
chains. The key technical idea is a (rather complicated) definition of
motivation in an interval-based temporal logic. </p>

<p>

 <a href="#morgenstern:1996a">Morgenstern 1996</a>
 presents a summary of the theory, along with reasons for rejecting
its causal rivals. The most important of these is that accounts based
on the Situation Calculus do not appear to generalize to cases
allowing for concurrency and ignorance. She also cites the failure of
early causal theories to deal with retrodiction. </p>

<h4>4.6.3 State-Based Minimization in the Event Calculus</h4>

<p>

 <a href="#baker_ab:1989a">Baker 1989</a>
 works with circumscriptive versions of the Yale Shooting Anomaly.
Recall that circumscription uses preferred models in which the
extensions of abnormality predicates are minimized. In the course of
this minimization, certain parameters (including, of course, the
predicates to be minimized) are allowed to vary; the rest are held
constant. Which parameters vary and which are held constant is
determined by the application. </p>

<p>
In the earliest circumscriptive solutions to the Frame Problem, the
inertial rule \(\textbf{CIR}\) is stated using an abnormality
predicate.</p>

\[\tag*{\textbf{CIR}:}
\forall f, s, a [\lnot \texttt{Ab}(f, a, s)\rightarrow [\Holds(f, s)\leftrightarrow \Holds(f, \ttResult(a, s))]]
\]

<p>
This axiom uses a biconditional, so that it can be used for
retrodiction; this is typical of the more recent formulations of
commonsense inertia. An unsophisticated solution to the frame problem
minimizes the abnormality predicate while allowing the <span class="fw" style="font-size:90%">Holds</span>
predicate to vary and
keeping all other parameters fixed. This succumbs to the Yale Shooting
Anomaly in much the same way that default logic does. Circumscription
does not involve multiple extensions, so the anomaly appears as
inability to conclude that Fred is dead after the shooting.</p>

<p>
In Baker&rsquo;s reformulation of the problem, separate axioms ensure
the existence of a situation corresponding to each Boolean combination
of fluents, and the <span class="fw" style="font-size:90%">Result</span>
function is allowed to vary, while
the <span class="fw" style="font-size:90%">Holds</span> predicate is
held constant. In this setting, the <span class="fw" style="font-size:90%">Result</span>
function needs to be specified for
&ldquo;counterfactual&rdquo;actions&mdash;in particular, for shooting
and for waiting in the Yale Shooting Anomaly. It is this feature that
eliminates the incorrect model for that scenario; for details, see
 <a href="#baker_ab:1989a">Baker 1989</a>
 and
 <a href="#shanahan:1997a">Shanahan 1997</a>,
 Chapter 6.</p>

<p>
This idea, which Shanahan calls &ldquo;State-Based
Minimization,&rdquo; is developed and extended in
 <a href="#shanahan:1997a">Shanahan 1997</a>,
 in the context of a temporal logic deriving from the Event Calculus
of
 <a href="#kowalski-sergot:1986a">Kowalski &amp; Sergot 1986</a>.
 Shanahan&rsquo;s version has the advantage of being closely connected
to logic programming.</p>

<h4>4.6.4 Causal Theories</h4>

<p>
Recall that in the anomalous model of the Yale Shooting scenario the
gun becomes unloaded after the performance of the wait action, an
action which has no conventional effects. The unloading, then, is
uncaused. This suggests a solution that minimizes outcomes that have
no cause.</p>

<p>
This strategy was pursued in
 <a href="#geffner:1990a">Geffner 1990</a>
 and
 <a href="#geffner:1992c">1992</a>.
 A similar approach beginning with
 <a href="#lifschitz:1987c">Lifschitz 1987</a>
 develops a sustained line of research along these lines, carried out
not only by Lifschitz and his students and colleagues in the Texas
Action Group but by some others. For this work and further references,

<p>
Here, we describe the causal solution presented in
 <a href="#turner_h:1999a">Turner 1999</a>.
 Turner returns to the ideas of
 <a href="#geffner:1992c">Geffner 1992</a>,
 but places them in a simpler logical setting and applies them to the
formalization of more complex scenarios that illustrate the
interactions of causal inertia with other considerations, especially
the Ramification Problem.</p>

<p>
Ramification is induced by the presence of <em>static</em> laws which
relate the direct consequences of actions to other changes. A
car-starting scenario illustrates the difficulties. There is one
action, <em>turn-on</em>, which turns on the ignition; let&rsquo;s
suppose that this action has no preconditions. There is a fluent
\(Ig\) tracking whether the ignition is on, a fluent
<em>Dead</em> tracking whether the battery is dead, and a fluent
<em>Run</em> tracking whether the engine is running. A static law says
that if the ignition is on and the battery isn&rsquo;t dead, the
engine is running. (Let&rsquo;s suppose that every other source of
failure has already been eliminated in this scenario; the only
possible reason for not starting is the battery.) We want to consider
a transition in which <em>turn-on</em> is performed when the ignition
isn&rsquo;t on, the battery is not dead, and the car isn&rsquo;t running.</p>

<p>
Of course, we want to infer in such a case that a performance of
<em>turn-on</em> will result in a situation in which the ignition is
on, the battery isn&rsquo;t dead, and the engine is running. But
contraposed causal laws frustrate this conclusion. The difficulty is
this: we can conclude by contraposing our only static law that if the
ignition is on and the engine isn&rsquo;t running, then the battery is
dead. This law not only is true in our scenario, but would be used to
explain a failed attempt to start the car. But if it is used for
prediction, then performing <em>turn-on</em> will produce a
&ldquo;Murphy&rsquo;s law&rdquo; outcome in which the ignition is on, the
battery is dead, and the engine isn&rsquo;t running. Everything has a
cause in this unwanted outcome: The battery is dead because of causal
inertia and the engine isn&rsquo;t running because of the contraposed
causal law.</p>

<p>
Readers who want to explore in some detail the problems of embedding a
nonmonotonic solution to the Frame Problem in relatively expressive
action languages can look to
 <a href="#gelfond-lifschitz:1998a">Gelfond &amp; Lifschitz 1998</a>.
 This paper presents an increasingly powerful and sophisticated series
of action languages incorporating a somewhat <em>ad hoc</em> solution
to the Ramification Problem.
 <a href="#turner_h:1999a">Turner 1999</a>
 is an improvement along these lines.</p>

<p>
Turner&rsquo;s idea is to treat \(\texttt{Caused}\)
as a modal operator
\([c]\), which is
provided with a nonmonotonic preferred models interpretation.
Universal causality prevails in a preferred model: the caused
propositions and the true propositions must coincide. Moreover, this
model must be unique; it must be the only possibility consistent with
the extensional part of the language.</p>

<p>
To understand this idea, it&rsquo;s helpful to recall that in the possible
worlds interpretation of \(\mathbf{S5}\), worlds can be identified
with <em>state descriptions</em>, i.e. with complete, consistent sets
\(I\) of literals (atomic formulas and their negations). This
allows us to think of a model as a pair \(\langle I,
S\rangle\), where \(S\) is a set of interpretations including
\(I\). The modal operator
\([c]\) is given
the standard semantics. Where \(S\) is a set of interpretations
and where <span class="nobr">\(I\in S,
S\vDash_I[c]A\)</span>
if and only if
\(S\vDash_{I'}A\)
for all \(I'\in S. \langle I,
S\rangle\) <em>satisfies</em> a set of formulas \(T\) if and
only if
\(S\vDash_I A\) for
all \(A\in T\).</p>

<p>
Turner&rsquo;s preferred models of \(T\) are the pairs
\(\langle I, S\rangle\) such that: (1) \(\langle I,
S\rangle\) satisfies \(T\), (2) \(S = \{I\}\),
and (3) \(\langle I, S\rangle\) is the unique interpretation
\(\langle\)<em>I\('\)</em>, <em>S\('\)</em>\(\rangle\) meeting conditions (1)
and (2). Condition (2) guarantees the &ldquo;universality of
causation;&rdquo; it validates \(A \leftrightarrow [c]A\).
Condition (3) &ldquo;grounds&rdquo; causality in noncausal information
(in the models in which we are interested, this will be a matter of
which fluents hold in which situations), in the strongest sense: it is
uniquely determined by this information.</p>

<p>
Although it is not evident, Turner&rsquo;s account of preferred models
turns out to be related to more general nonmonotonic logics, such as
default logic. Consult
 <a href="#turner_h:1999a">Turner 1999</a>
 for details.</p>

<p>
The axioms that specify the effects of actions treat these effects as
caused; for instance, the axiom schema for loading would read as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<table class="cellpad-small">
<tr>
 <td><strong>Causal-Load:</strong></td>
 <td> \([c]\Holds(\Loaded, \ttResult(\load, s))\)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-25" id="ref-25">25</a>]</sup></td>
 </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
Ramifications of the immediate effects of actions are also treated as
caused. And there are two nonmonotonic inertial axiom schemata:</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
([c] \Holds(f, s)\land {}&amp;\Holds(f, \ttResult(a, s))) \\
 &amp;\rightarrow [c]\Holds(f, \ttResult(a, s))
\end{aligned}\]

<p>and</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
([c] \lnot\Holds(f, s)\land {}&amp;\lnot\Holds(f, \ttResult(a, s))) \\
&amp;\rightarrow [c]\lnot\Holds(f, \ttResult(a, s))
\end{aligned}\]


<p>
Thus, a true proposition can be caused either because it is the direct
or indirect effect of an action, or because it involves the
persistence of a caused proposition. Initial conditions are also
considered to be caused, by stipulation. </p>

<p>
To illustrate the workings of this approach, consider the simplest
case: a language with just one fluent-denoting constant, <span class="ss light smaller">f</span>,
and one action-denoting constant,
<span class="ss light smaller">wait</span>. As in the Yale shooting
problem, there are no axioms for <span class="ss light smaller">wait</span>;
the action can always be performed and has no
associated effects. Let s\(_1\) be the result of performing the
wait action in s\(_0)\).</p>

<p>
The theory \(T\) contains an initial condition </p>
\[\Holds( \mathsf{f}, \mathsf{s}_0)\]

<p>
and a statement that the initial condition is caused,</p>
\[[c]\Holds( \mathsf{f}, \mathsf{s}_0),\]

<p>
Two models of \(T\) satisfy conditions (1) and (2):</p>

\[
M_1 = \langle I_1,\{I_1\}\rangle \text{ and }
M_2 = \langle I_2,\{I_2\}\rangle,
\]

<p>
where</p>

\[I_1=\{\Holds( \mathsf{f}, \mathsf{s}_0), \Holds( \mathsf{f}, \mathsf{s}_1)\} \text{ and }I_2=\{\Holds( \mathsf{f}, \mathsf{s}_0), \lnot\Holds( \mathsf{f}, \mathsf{s}_1)\}. \]

<p>
\(M_1\) is the intended model, in which nothing
changes. It satisfies Condition (3), since if
\(\langle I_1, S\rangle\) satisfies \(T\) then
it satisfies \([c]\Holds(\mathrm{f}, \mathrm{s}_1)\)
by the
inertial axiom</p>
\[([c]\Holds(\mathsf{f}, \mathsf{s}_0)\land \Holds(\mathsf{f}, \mathsf{s}_1))\rightarrow [c]\Holds(\mathsf{f}, \mathsf{s}_1)\]

<p>
Therefore, \(S = \{I_1\}\).</p>

<p>
\(M_2\) is an anomalous model, in which the fluent
ceases spontaneously. This model does not satisfy Condition (3), since
\(M_3 = \langle I_2,\{I_1,
I_2\}\rangle\) also satisfies \(T\); in particular,
it satisfies the inertial axiom for f because it fails to satisfy \(\Holds(\mathsf{f}, \mathsf{s}_1)\).
So, while \(M_1\) is a
preferred model, \(M_2\) is not.</p>

<p>
Turner&rsquo;s approach avoids the problem of contraposition by giving
causal relations the form</p>

\[[\sc{Background-Conditions} \land \sc{Cause}]\rightarrow [c]\sc{Effect}\]

<p>
When contraposed, this becomes </p>

\[[\sc{Cause}\land \lnot [c] \sc{Effect}]\rightarrow \lnot \sc{Background-Conditions}\]

<p>
which does not have the form of a causal law. </p>

<p>
The apparent usefulness of a &ldquo;principle of universal
causality&rdquo; in accounting for a range of problems in qualitative
commonsense reasoning should be of interest to philosophers. And the
causal theory, as initiated by Geffner and developed by Turner, has
many interesting detailed features. For instance, while philosophical
work on causality has concentrated on the causal relation, Taylor&rsquo;s
approach shows that much can be done with only a nonrelational causal
predicate.</p>

<p>
Action-driven dynamics can be used to construct models for conditional
logics.
 <a href="#lent-thomason:2015a">Lent and Thomason 2015</a>
 uses Turner&rsquo;s causal approach to provide such models in the
restricted case where the antecedent is the conjunction of an action
expression and simple nonmodal conditions. An explicit solution to the
frame problem provides counterfactual predictions and automatically
provides a conditional semantics.</p>

<p>

 <a href="#morgenstern:1996a">Morgenstern 1996</a>
 offers two chief criticisms of the causal approach to reasoning about
actions: that it does not give an adequate account of
 explanation<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-26" id="ref-26">26</a>]</sup>
 and that the Situation Calculus itself is limited in scope. Neither
criticism is fatal; both can be taken as challenges for future
research.</p>

<p>
For another approach to nonmonotonic causal reasoning, based on
input-output logics (<a>Makinson &amp; van der Torre 2000</a>), see
 <a href="#bochman:2004b">Bochman 2004</a>.</p>
 
<h2 id="CausReas">5. Causal Reasoning</h2>

<p>
Of course, causal reasoning is an important topic in its own right.
For instance, it figures in qualitative reasoning about devices.
Herbert Simon&rsquo;s work in this area goes back to the 1950s: see
 <a href="#simon_ha:1952a">Simon 1952</a>;
 <a href="#simon_ha:1977a">1977</a>;
 <a href="#iwasaki-simon:1986a">Iwasaki &amp; Simon 1986</a>.
 Judea Pearl and his students and associates are responsible for the
most sustained and successful investigation of causal models and
causal reasoning. Pearl and many of his co-authors are computer
scientists, but statisticians and philosophers have also contributed
to this research program. We will not discuss causal networks further
here. See
 <a href="#halpern_jy:2016a">Halpern 2016</a>
 and
 <a href="#hitchcock_c:2022a">Hitchcock 2022</a>.</p>
 
<h2 id="SpatReas">6. Spatial Reasoning</h2>

<p>
The precomputational literature in philosophical logic relating to
spatial reasoning is relatively sparse. But the need to support
computational reasoning about space in application areas such as
motion planning and manipulation in physical space, the indexing and
retrieval of images, geographic information systems, diagrammatic
reasoning, and the design of high-level graphics programs has led to
new interest in spatial representations and spatial reasoning. Of
course, the geometrical tradition provides an exceptionally strong
mathematical resource for this enterprise. But as in many other
AI-related areas, it is not clear these theories are appropriate for
informing these applications, and many computer scientists have felt
it worthwhile to develop new foundations. Some of this work is closely
related to the research in qualitative reasoning mentioned above in
 <a href="#FormCommSens">Section 2.2</a>,
 and in some cases has been carried out by the same individuals. And
of course, there also are connections to the mereology literature in
philosophical logic.</p>

<p>
The AI literature in spatial reasoning is extensive; for references to
some areas not discussed here, see

 and
 <a href="#kosslyn:1990a">Kosslyn 1990</a>.
 Here, we discuss only one trend, which is closely connected with
parallel work in philosophical logic.</p>

<p>
Qualitative approaches to space were introduced into the logical
literature early in the twentieth century by Stanis&#322;aw
Le&#347;niewski; see
 <a href="#lesniewski:1916a">Le&#347;niewski 1916</a>,
 which presents the idea of a <em>mereology</em>, or qualitative
theory of the part-whole relation between physical individuals. This
idea of a logical theory of relations among regions remained active in
philosophical logic, even though it attracted relatively few
researchers. More recent work in the philosophical literature,
especially
 <a href="#casati-varzi:1999a">Casati &amp; Varzi 1999</a>,
 <a href="#simons_p:1987a">Simons 1987</a>,
 <a href="#casati-varzi:1996a">Casati &amp; Varzi 1996</a>,
 <a href="#clarke_b:1981a">Clarke 1981</a>, and
 <a href="#clarke_b:1985a">Clarke 1985</a>,
 has influenced the current computational work.</p>

<p>
The Regional Connection Calculus (RCC), developed by computer
scientists at the University of Leeds, is based on a primitive
\(C\) relating regions of space: the intended interpretation of
\(C(x, y)\) is that the intersection of the
closures of the values of \(x\) and \(y\) is nonempty. See
 <a href="#cohn_ag-etal:1997a">Cohn <em>et al</em>. 1997</a>,
 <a href="#cohn_ag-:1997a">Cohn 1996</a>) for details and references. The extent of what can be
defined with this simple primitive is surprising, but the
technicalities quickly become complex; see, for instance,
 <a href="#gotts:1994a">Gotts 1994</a>,

<h2 id="ReasAbouKnow">7. Reasoning about Knowledge</h2>

<p>

 <a href="#hintikka:1962a">Hintikka 1962</a>,
 the classical source for epistemic logic, takes its cue from modal
logic. Thus, the work concentrates on how to model the attitudes of a
single agent with modal operators. Because possible-worlds semantics
accommodates alternative modal operators, Hintikka discusses at length
the question of exactly which alternatives are appropriate for
knowledge and belief, opting for the modal logic \(\mathbf{S4}\).
For more background and information about later developments, see
 <a href="#rendsvig_r-symons_j">Rendsvig &amp; Symons 2022</a>.
 And
 <a href="#laux-wansing:1995a">Laux &amp; Wansing 1995</a>
 discusses both the philosophical and computational traditions up to
1994.</p>

<p>
Epistemic attitudes figure in game theory, as well as logical AI, and
work in both of these application areas either parallels or was
influenced by Hintikka&rsquo;s modal approach. In several papers (including
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1:1979c1">McCarthy 1979</a>),
 John McCarthy recommended an approach to formalizing knowledge that
uses first-order logic, but that quantifies explicitly over such
things as individual concepts. Here, however, we discuss the approach
taken by most computer scientists, who&mdash;unlike McCarthy&mdash;use
modal logic, but&mdash;unlike Hintikka&mdash;concentrate on the
multiagent case. </p>

<p>

 <a href="#fagin-etal:1995b">Fagin <em>et al</em>. 1995</a>
 simplifies the underlying modality, using \(\mathbf{S5}\) for
knowledge (or deontic \(\mathbf{S5}\) for belief), but
concentrates on agents&rsquo; attitudes about one another&rsquo;s
attitudes. Such logics have direct applications in the analysis of
<em>distributed systems</em>, dynamic systems in which change is
effected by message actions, which modify the knowledge of agents
according to rules determined by a <em>communications protocol</em>.
Multi-Agent epistemic logic is another example of how the need of
applications provided the inspiration for significant contributions to
logic.
 <a href="#fagin-etal:1995b">Fagin <em>et al</em>. 1995</a>;
 is essential reading for anyone seriously interested in this topic.
Other applied work in epistemic logic is reported in the proceedings
of a series of conferences initiated in 1986 with
 <a href="#halpern:1986c">Halpern 1986</a>.
 These conferences record one of the most successful collaborations of
philosophers with logicians in Computer Science, although the group of
involved philosophers has been relatively small. The focus of the
conferences has gradually shifted from Computer Science to
Economics.</p>

<p>
Computer scientists are used to thinking of reasoning as the
manipulation of symbolic representations. And it is mainly due to AI
that limited rationality has become a topic of serious interest,
providing a counterbalance to the idealizations of philosophy and
 economics.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-27" id="ref-27">27</a>]</sup>
 You would think, then, that closure of epistemic attitudes under
logical consequence would be highly unpopular in AI. But this is not
so; the possible worlds approach to attitudes is not only the leading
theory in the areas discussed in
 <a href="#fagin-etal:1995b">Fagin <em>et al</em>. 1995</a>,
 but has even been advocated in robotics applications; see
 <a href="#rosenschein_sj-kaelbling:1995a">Rosenschein &amp; Kaelbling 1995</a>;
 <a href="#rosenschein_sj:1989a">Rosenschein 1989</a>. Nevertheless, the issue of hyperintensionality has been
investigated in the AI literature; see
 <a href="#perlis:1985a">Perlis 1985</a>;
 <a href="#konolige:1986a">Konolige 1986</a>;
 <a href="#lakemeyer:1994a">Lakemeyer 1997</a>;
 <a href="#levesque:1984b">Levesque 1984</a>). Though the work on this topic in AI provides new
theories and some new results, no leading approach has yet
emerged.</p>

<h2 id="TowaFormCommSens">8. Towards a Formalization of Common Sense</h2>

<p>
John McCarthy&rsquo;s explicit long-term goal&mdash;the formalization
of commonsense knowledge&mdash;was adopted and pursued by a relatively
small subcommunity of AI researchers. The work of a much larger group
(those involved in knowledge representation, cognitive robotics, and
qualitative physics) contributes to specialized projects that support
the larger goal. Anything remotely like a formalization of common
sense is so far from being accomplished that&mdash;if it is achievable
at all&mdash;guessing when we could expect the task to be completed is
hopeless. But at least the effort has yielded a better sense of how to
develop a workable methodology for formalizing commonsense examples
and domains, and of how to divide the larger problem up into more
manageable parts.</p>

<p>
The first book-length treatment of this topic,
 <a href="#davis_e:1991a">Davis 1991</a>,
 divides the general problem into the following subtopics.</p>

<ol>

<li> Quantities and Measurements</li>

<li> Time</li>

<li> Space</li>

<li> Physics</li>

<li> Minds</li>

<li> Plans and Goals</li>

<li> Society</li>
</ol>

<p>
The first four of these topics overlaps with qualitative physics. For
more information on this related subfield, consult
 <a href="#weld-dekleer:1990a">Weld &amp; de Kleer 1990</a>,
 <a href="#davis_e:2008b">Davis 2008</a>, and
 <a href="#forbus_kd:2008b">Forbus 2008</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Item 6 is the most extensively studied of Davis&rsquo;s seven.
 <a href="#ReasAbouActiChan">Section 4</a>
 discussed the early phases of this work. There is a robust subsequent
history of research on planning and goal formation, with the later
work blending into work on planning architectures for autonomous
agents. Items 5 and 7 are underresearched. Although artificial
societies and architectures for artificial minds have been intensively
studied, there has been relatively little work on the formalization of
commonsense psychology and commonsense interpersonal reasoning.
However, see
 <a href="#davis_e:1991a">Davis 1991</a>
 and
 <a href="#hobbs-gordon_a:2005a">Hobbs &amp; Gordon 2005</a>.
 </p>

<p>
For a book-length treatment of the commonsense challenge, see
 <a href="#mueller_et:2006a">Mueller, 2006</a>.
 More than half of the book is devoted to reasoning about actions and
change. There are short chapters on space and mental states, and a
longer treatment of nonmonotonic reasoning. </p>

<p>
Research in computer science is almost entirely driven by the
availability of funding. The formalization of commonsense reasoning
was never heavily funded, but until John McCarthy&rsquo;s death in 2011
small amounts of funding were available. There were regular meetings
of the commonsense interest group in 1998, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, and
2009. Many of the papers presented at the 2003 conference were
collected in expanded form in 2004, in Volume 153 of <em>Artificial
Intelligence</em>.
 <a href="#davis_e-morgenstern:2004a"> Davis &amp; Morgenstern 2004</a>,
 the introduction to this collection, provides a useful survey and
appreciation of research in the formalization of common sense and the
mechanization of commonsense reasoning. The
 <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/leora/commonsense/" target="other">Common Sense Problem Page</a>
 is still maintained, but activity in this field has been slow from
2010 until the present, except for related knowledge representation
research.</p>

<p>
Borrowing the idea from other areas of computer science, the
commonsense community has sought to develop suites of &ldquo;benchmark
problems&rdquo;: to publicize problems that are difficult but not
impossibly difficult and to encourage the creation of solutions and
their comparison. Probably the best-documented problem to date is
Ernest Davis&rsquo; &ldquo;egg-cracking problem.&rdquo; This is
formulated as follows in
 <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/leora/commonsense/" target="other">the Common Sense Problem Page</a>.</p>
 
<blockquote>
A cook is cracking a raw egg against a glass bowl. Properly performed,
the impact of the egg against the edge of the bowl will crack the
eggshell in half. Holding the egg over the bowl, the cook will
separate the two halves of the shell with his fingers, enlarging the
crack, and the contents of the egg will fall gently into the bowl. The
end result is that the entire contents of the egg will be in the bowl,
with the egg unbroken, and that the two halves of the shell are in the
cook&rsquo;s fingers.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<em>Variants:</em> What happens if: The cook brings the egg to impact
very quickly? Very slowly? The cook lays the egg in the bowl and
exerts steady pressure with his hand? The cook, having cracked the
egg, attempts to peel it off its contents like a hard-boiled egg? The
bowl is made of looseleaf paper? Of soft clay? The bowl is smaller
than the egg? The bowl is upside down? The cook tries this procedure
with a hard-boiled egg? With a coconut? With an M&amp;M?
</blockquote>

<p>
Along with the problem itself three solutions are posted:
 <a href="#shanahan:2004a">Shanahan 2004</a>,
 <a href="#lifschitz:1998b">Lifschitz 1998a</a>, and a version of
 <a href="#morgenstern:2001a">Morgenstern 2001</a>.
 Comparing the solutions is instructive&mdash;similarities outweigh
differences. All the authors think of this as a planning problem, and
use versions of the Situation Calculus or the Event Calculus in the
formalization. Each axiomatization is modular, with, for instance,
separate modules devoted to the relevant geometrical and material
properties. Each author provides a &ldquo;proof of concept&rdquo; for
the formalization by showing that the axioms support a proof of the
correctness of a plan to crack the egg in the simple case. None of the
authors considers all of Davis&rsquo; elaborations of the problem, but
the axioms are framed with elaboration in mind and some elaborations
are considered. It isn&rsquo;t clear whether any of the authors
actually implemented their formalization (for instance, using a
theorem prover, an animation, or a robot controller). </p>

<p>
The egg-cracking example raises the problem of how to evaluate
moderately large formalizations of commonsense problems. Morgenstern
and Shanahan express this issue explicitly. Morgenstern suggests that
the important criteria are (1) Epistemological adequacy
(correspondence to intuitive reasoning, as experienced by people who
engage in it), (2) Faithfulness to the real world, (3) Reusability,
and (4) Elaboration tolerance. The first two of these criteria may be
too subjective to be very useful. To these, Shanahan adds (5)
Usability. More important, however, in the long run, would be the
automatization of testing and evaluation, by generating scenarios and
testing them with real-world or simulated robotic agents. </p>

<p>
Any even moderately successful attempt to formalize common sense will
soon encounter unprecedented problems of scale, creating challenges
similar to those that software engineering tries to address. Even
fairly small programs and systems of axioms are difficult to
comprehend and can produce unexpected results. Creating and
maintaining them may require teams of developers, precipitating
organizational issues, as well as issues having to do with the
integration of modules, the maintenance and testing of large systems,
and the generation of axioms from disparate knowledge sources.
Although the need for large-scale software systems has provided best
practices for enterprises of this kind it might well turn out that,
even with ample funding, human expertise would be inadequate for this
task. </p>

<p>
Two ways to automate the creation of formalizations can be imagined.
(1) The large-scale ontologies created by the knowledge representation
community could be mined for axioms, or (2) axioms could be created
directly from corpora using machine learning techniques. The first
method would entail unprecedented difficulties having to do with
knowledge integration. Techniques for rendering the products of
machine learning
 explainable<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-28" id="ref-28">28</a>]</sup>
 provide some hope for the second method, but the outputs of these
techniques are not at all like logical axioms and the task of
converting them appears to be challenging, to say the least.</p>

<p>
All this contrasts sharply with the methodology of philosophical
analysis. Analyses are far smaller in scale, are not formalized with
implementations in mind, and little or no attention is paid to their
integration. Philosophers have never chosen a specific domain
comparable to the planning domain and mounted a sustained attempt to
formalize it, along with a companion effort to develop appropriate
logics. </p>

<p>
It is easy to suspect that many of the topics that have preoccupied
analytic philosophy exhibit the sort of complexity that emerged, for
instance, from the attempts of AI researchers to formalize reasoning
about actions and their effects. If AI researchers were able to
develop and partially automate a formalization methodology for
problems like those listed in
 <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/leora/commonsense/" target="other">the Common Sense Problem Page</a>,
 this would certainly be a tremendous advance over what analytic
philosophers have been able to achieve. But perhaps philosophers can
congratulate themselves that this has proved to be such a difficult
challenge.</p>

<h2 id="TaxoReprReas">9. Taxonomic Representation and Reasoning</h2>

<h3 id="ConcBaseClas">9.1 Concept-Based Classification</h3>

<p>
Traditionally, the task of representing large amounts of domain
information for general-purpose reasoning has been one of the most
important areas of knowledge representation. Systems that exploit the
intuitive taxonomic organization of domains are useful for this
purpose; taxonomic hierarchies not only help to organize the process
of knowledge acquisition, but provide a useful connection to
rule-based
 reasoning.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-29" id="ref-29">29</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
For domains in which complex definitions are a natural way to organize
information, knowledge engineering services based on definitions of
concepts have been extremely successful. Like variable-free versions
of first-order logic (see, for instance,
 <a href="#quine:1960a">Quine 1960</a>),
 these systems are centered on concepts or first-order predicates, and
provide a number of mechanisms for their definition. The fundamental
algorithm associated with these <em>taxonomic logics</em> is a
classifier which inputs a system of definitions and outputs the
entailment relations between defined and primitive concepts. For
background on these systems, see
 <a href="#woods_wa-schmolze:1992a">Woods &amp; Schmolze 1992</a>
 and
 <a href="#brachman-etal:1991a">Brachman <em>et al</em>. 1991</a>.</p>
 
<p>
The simplest taxonomic logics can be regarded as subsystems of
first-order logic with complex predicates. But they have been extended
in many ways, and the issues raised by many of these extensions
overlap in many cases with topics in philosophical logic.</p>

<h3 id="NonmInhe">9.2 Nonmonotonic Inheritance</h3>

<p>
Much more complex logical issues arise when the organization of a
domain into hierarchies is allowed to have exceptions. One way to
approach this topic is to explore how to make a taxonomic logic
nonmonotonic; but <em>nonmonotonic inheritance</em> is a topic in its
own right. Although there are strong affinities to nonmonotonic logic,
nonmonotonic inheritance relies more heavily on graph-based
representations than on traditional logical ideas, and seems to
provide a much finer-grained approach to nonmonotonic reasoning that
raises entirely new issues, and which quickly becomes problematic. For
this reason, systems of nonmonotonic inheritance tend to be
expressively weak, and their relations to the more powerful
nonmonotonic logic has never been fully clarified. For background on
this topic, see
 <a href="#thomason_rh:1992a">Thomason 1992</a>
 and
 <a href="#horty:1994a">Horty 1994</a>.</p>
 
<h2 id="ContReas">10. Contextual Reasoning</h2>

<p>
In the tradition in philosophical logic dealing with contextual
effects on the interpretation of expressions, as well as in the more
recent tradition in dynamic logic, context is primarily formalized as
an assignment of values to variables, and the language is designed to
make explicit reasoning about context either very limited or outright
impossible.</p>

<p>
Concern in AI about the representation of large and apparently
heterogeneous domains and about the integration of disparate knowledge
sources, as well as interests in formalizing common sense of the sort
discussed in
 <a href="#FormCommSens">Section 2.2</a>,
 above, have led to interest in the AI community in formalizing
languages that take context into account more explicitly.</p>

<p>
In
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1:1993b">McCarthy 1993b</a>,
 McCarthy recommends the study of languages containing a construct</p>

\[\textit{ist}(c, \phi),\]

<p>
where \(\textit{ist}\) is read &ldquo;is-true.&rdquo; This is analogous to
the \(\Holds\) construct of the situation calculus&mdash;but now
\(c\) stands for a context, and \(\phi\) is a possibly complex
propositional representation, which many (including McCarthy) take to
refer to a sentence. </p>

<p>
There are analogies here both to modal logic and to languages with an
explicit truth predicate. But the applications that are envisioned for
a logic of context create opportunities and problems that are in many
ways new. Work on the logic of context subsequent to McCarthy&rsquo;s
original suggestion, includes
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1-buvac:1995a2">McCarthy &amp; Buvac 1998</a>,
 <a href="#guha:1991a">Guha 1991</a>, and some of the papers in the conference volumes
 <a href="#akman-etal:2001a">Akman <em>et al</em>. 2001</a>
 and
 <a href="#bouquet-etal:1999a">Bouquet <em>et al</em>. 1999</a>.
 For extensions of Richard Montague&rsquo;s Intensional Logic
motivated by McCarthy&rsquo;s suggestions, see
 <a href="#thomason_rh:2003a">Thomason 2003</a>
 and
 <a href="#thomason_rh:2005a">2005</a>.</p>
 
<p>
For some reason, work on the explicit formalization of context
hasn&rsquo;t been pursued intensively by the computational community
beyond this point, but for an application to information integration,
see
 <a href="#snidaro_l-etal:2019a">Snidaro 2019</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Philosophical interest in context, and especially in the interaction
of context with propositional attitudes and modals, continues to be
strong; but the very general logical frameworks for context that
McCarthy envisioned have yet not been taken up by philosophers.</p>

<h2 id="ProsForLogiTheoPracReas">11. Prospects for a Logical Theory of Practical Reason</h2>

<p>
There is reason to hope that the combination of logical methods with
planning applications in AI can enable the development of a far more
comprehensive and adequate theory of practical reasoning than has
heretofore been possible. As with many problems having to do with
common sense reasoning, the scale and complexity of the formalizations
that are required are beyond the traditional techniques of
philosophical logic. However, with computational methods of
implementing and testing the formalizations and with areas such as
cognitive robotics providing laboratories for developing and testing
ideas, we can hope to radically advance a problem that has seen little
progress since it was first proposed by Aristotle: how to devise a
formalization of practical reasoning that is genuinely applicable to
realistic problems. </p>

<p>
The classical work in deontic logic that was begun by von Wright (see
 <a href="#vonwright:1983a">von Wright 1983</a>)
 is one source of ideas; see
 (<a href="#horty:2001a">Horty 2001</a>
 and
 <a href="#vandertorre-tan:1997b">van der Torre 1997</a>).
 In fact, as the more recent work in deontic logic shows, nonmonotonic
logic provides a natural and useful supplement to the classical
deontic logic. One recent work
 (<a href="#horty:2012a">Horty 2012</a>)
 seeks to base deontic logic on a prioritized version of
Reiter&rsquo;s default logic. </p>

<p>
An even more robust account of practical reasoning begins to emerge
when these ideas are supplemented with work on the foundations of
planning and reasoning about action that were discussed in
 <a href="#ReasAbouActiChan">Section 4</a>,
 above. But this development can be pursued even further, by extending
the formalism to include preferences and
 intentions.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-30" id="ref-30">30</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Ultimately, what is needed is a model of an intelligent reasoning and
acting agent. Developing such a model need not be entirely a matter of
logic, but according to one school of thought, logic has a central
role to play in it; see, for instance,
 <a href="#baral-gelfond:2000a">Baral &amp; Gelfond 2000</a>,

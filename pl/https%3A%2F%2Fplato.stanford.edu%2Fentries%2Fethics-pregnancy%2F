<h1>Pregnancy, Birth, and Medicine</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Feb 17, 2011; substantive revision Fri May 17, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Pregnancy and birth can be approached from many philosophical angles,
including philosophy of law, philosophy of biology, and mereology.
Some authors have focused on ethical issues surrounding abortion and
assisted reproduction, others have discussed pregnancy in
phenomenological terms, and others have used pregnancy and/or birth as
a springboard for more theoretical reflections on the nature of
selfhood, care, embodiment, and personal identity (see entries on
 <a href="../feminism-family/">feminist perspectives on reproduction and the family</a>,
 <a href="../parenthood/">parenthood and procreation</a>, and
 <a href="../grounds-moral-status/">the grounds of moral status</a>
 for discussions of these and related issues). In this article,
however, we will focus on pregnancy and birth insofar as they are
treated as <em>medical</em> processes and situated within a medical
context. This includes not only problems during pregnancy that require
medical care and intervention, but also normal pregnancy and birth,
which are highly &lsquo;medicalized&rsquo; in most developed
countries. (The boundary around this topic is necessarily imperfect,
since medical, legal, metaphysical, experiential, and other contexts
intersect. For instance, one cannot responsibly examine the ethics of
treating the fetus as a <em>medical</em> patient without at least
considering the legal ramifications of doing so.)</p>

<p>
We will begin with a general discussion of pregnancy and childbirth as
medicalized processes. We will then move on to three categories of
ethical issues: (1) issues arising in the course of obstetrical care
for women who are taken to be competent and capable of autonomous
decision-making; (2) issues that arise when women are decisionally
incompetent or when their right to decisional autonomy is in question;
(3) issues concerning the management and communication of reproductive
risk.</p>

<h2 id="Medi">1. Medicalization</h2>

<p>
Pregnancy and childbirth have become increasingly <em>medicalized</em>
in most parts of the world since the early twentieth century. That is,
they are increasingly processes that&mdash;in fact and as a social
ideal&mdash;are managed and overseen by medical professionals,
typically involve a high degree of technological medical intervention
and contact with clinics and hospitals, and are assessed by medical
experts who are the authorities on their progress. Amy Mullin explains
that medicalized pregnancy &ldquo;involves interpreting pregnancy
itself as a disruption to health that necessarily requires expert
medical intervention, and thinking of pregnancy as primarily about
health and illness&rdquo; (Mullin 2005, 54). The concept of
medicalization is helpful in making clear how this sort of insertion
into a medical context is not (or not simply) a response to fixed
biological facts, but rather a contingent social and institutional
process. In general, medicalization comes with both benefits and
burdens, and the medicalization of pregnancy and birth is no
exception: while medical interventions have lessened many risks (e.g.
death from placenta previa and ectopic pregnancy), other medical
interventions have become routine despite having no proven benefit and
some proven added risks for patients (e.g. routine fetal monitoring,
normalization of the lithotomy position for childbirth, and
episiotomies). Recent years have seen increasing reference to, and
criticism of, the <em>over</em>-medicalization of pregnancy and
childbirth, and opposing narratives of pregnancy and birth continue to
grow in visibility and support. These narratives may aim to
de-medicalize the notion of normalcy in pregnancy and birth, or
centralize the knowledge and competence of midwifery (e.g., Lyerly
2012; Shaw 2013). Others have drawn attention to the relationship
between over-medicalization and misogyny in obstetric care,
highlighting widespread failures to respect normal standards of
patient autonomy and informed consent in childbirth, &ldquo;too much
too soon&rdquo; medical intervention, and obstetric violence (e.g.,
Flanigan 2016; Shabot and Korem 2018; Kingma 2021).</p>

<p>
Both inside and outside the clinic, pregnancy is treated as a medical
event requiring intense risk management, monitoring, and appeals to
expert medical knowledge. Pregnant women are expected&mdash;per social
norms and as part of responsible motherhood&mdash;to regulate and
monitor their eating, drinking, fetal kicks, weight gain, sleeping
position, exercise, and many other aspects of their lives according to
standards established by medical professionals (Kukla 2005; Seigel
2014). Prior to birth, most pregnancies will involve medical
interventions such as genetic testing, ultrasound screening, and
prescriptions to control various symptoms and risks. In some
countries, there has been a vigorous mandate to involve medical
professionals in helping women regulate their bodies in accordance
with medical standards for minimizing reproductive risk even prior to
conception (Kuehn 2006). Technological intervention in birth in
developed countries regularly includes labor-inducing drugs, spinal
epidurals, and fetal monitoring. Surgical birth (caesarean section)
has been increasing in frequency in many countries, despite growing
concerns about its overuse (e.g., Ghosh and James 2010; Betr&aacute;n
et al. 2021). Some critics have voiced concerns around the normative
influence of such trends. Rebecca Brione suggests, for example, that
&ldquo;reliance on medical technology in labour creates the sense that
use of such expertise is required for a safe birth: it is seem as a
guarantor of results, removing responsibility from the mother&rdquo;
(2015, 75). Importantly, however, the rate and intensity with which
such interventions are offered or imposed is far from uniform;
statistical analyses continue to demonstrate a striking disparity of
benefits enjoyed as a result of medicalization, for pregnant patients
and their babies alike, even in high- and upper-middle-income
countries (Roberts, 2009). Both neonatal death and stillbirth are
twice as common in babies born to Black women than to White women,
whilst babies born to Hispanic-identified women had a threefold higher
rate of neonatal death than those born to White women (Sheikh et al.
2022). In the UK, Black women are four times more likely than White
women to die during pregnancy and childbirth; in Asian women, this
risk is twice as high as in White women, and &ldquo;women living in
the most deprived areas of the UK are almost three times more likely
to die than those in the most affluent areas&rdquo; (Limb 2021).</p>

<p>
The widespread medicalization of pregnancy and birth has had several
ethically noteworthy effects. First, medicalization has encouraged us
to imagine pregnancy and birth as inherently high-risk, pathological
processes that it is irresponsible to undertake without large amounts
of expert help and surveillance (see e.g. Lupton 1998; Brione 2015).
Second, when medical professionals become the primary managers of
reproduction, pregnant women&rsquo;s epistemic privilege is undermined
and they are arguably reduced to playing passive roles in their own
pregnancies and births (e.g., Freeman 2015). Professional advice tends
to focus exclusively on the behaviour (diet, exercise, sleep, and so
on) of pregnant patients and not on the behaviour of partners or
employers, or on the effects of environments such as offices or public
transports; further this advice is also often framed in terms of
<em>avoiding</em> harm to the fetus. As a consequence, &ldquo;while
pregnant women are rarely seen as actively contributing to the work of
nurturing the fetus, any &lsquo;inappropriate&rsquo; behaviour
(including failure to adhere to all recommendations, such as taking
particular vitamins) may be seen as detracting from the development
process. There is therefore a perceived need for medical professionals
to monitor and &lsquo;manage&rsquo; pregnant women to ensure their
compliance with medical advice&rdquo; (Baron 2019, 497). Third, some
have argued that medicalization has rendered pregnancy in general, and
labor and birth in particular, more alienating and stressful for
women, burdening them with constant and complicated responsibilities
for elaborate risk management and bodily and behavioral surveillance
(for review see, e.g., Mykitiuk and Scott 2011; Savell 2012).</p>

<p>
Among the voices pushing back against the medicalization of
reproduction are those insisting that pregnancy is a
&lsquo;natural&rsquo; process that generally needs no technological
assistance, and advocate &lsquo;natural&rsquo; childbirth, free of
labor-inducing and pain medications and attended by midwives rather
than doctors (see section 2.2. for more detailed discussion). There
are reasons for philosophers to be as wary of the
&lsquo;natural&rsquo; birth movement as of uncritical, unchecked
medicalization (Kukla 2005, Lyerly 2006 and 2012, Purdy 2001).
Typically, its advocates do not specify a clear concept of the
&lsquo;natural&rsquo;&mdash;for example, they have no account of why
prescription pain medications are &lsquo;unnatural&rsquo; while
acupuncture or pain-relieving herbs are &lsquo;natural&rsquo;. Nor do
they explain why the &lsquo;natural&rsquo; is <em>prima facie</em>
better or more ethical. More broadly, this account of pregnancy and
birth involves comparable pressures on pregnant women to conform to
rigid standards of attitudes and behaviours, and, like the medicalized
account, is in danger of de-politicizing and essentializing the
experience and management of pregnant women (Beckett 2005, Malacrida
and Boulton 2014). An important point put forward by Frank Chervenak
and Laurence McCullough (2006) is that the alternative to medicalized
pregnancy is not necessarily &lsquo;natural&rsquo; pregnancy. Rather,
medicine is one institution among many that vies for control over the
cultural use and significance of obstetric technology; pregnancy is
likely to continue to be technologically intensive no matter how this
struggle plays out.</p>

<h2 id="EthiIssuObstCare">2. Ethical Issues in Obstetrical Care</h2>

<p>
In this section, we examine ethical issues that can arise in the
course of obstetrical care for women whose decisional autonomy and
competence are not in question.</p>

<h3 id="PrenDiagScre">2.1 Prenatal Diagnosis and Screening</h3>

<p>
It is becoming increasingly routine to test fetuses for a variety of
genetic and other anomalies. Ultrasound screening for various
morphological anomalies and the Maternal Serum Alpha-Fetoprotein Test
(MSAFP) that screens for trisomy chromosomal disorders (such as Down
syndrome) are routine parts of prenatal care. Other tests such as
amniocentesis and genetic testing for Tay-Sachs disease are common. It
seems clear that the range of conditions and traits for which prenatal
testing (PT) is possible will continue to grow rapidly, allowing
parents and society at large new forms of control over what sorts of
children are born, and enhancing the level of medicalization and
surveillance during pregnancy. These tests raise a variety of ethical
issues.</p>

<h4>2.1.1 Issues for Pregnant Women</h4>

<p>
Some authors (e.g. Robertson 1996) have argued that PT
straightforwardly enhances women&rsquo;s reproductive autonomy, on the
grounds that all PT is, strictly speaking, voluntary (even if
routinization and social pressures together may guide women towards
choosing it), and such tests give prospective parents a form of
increased control over their reproductive lives. However, there are
reasons to doubt that increased access to PT translates directly into
an increase in women&rsquo;s autonomy. Prenatal screening and
diagnosis does not, at the very least, obviously or in principle
operate to enhance free choices for women; further, it contributes to
cultural forces portraying pregnancy as an inherently risky and
perilous process (Duden 1993). Virtually all women undergo routine
ultrasound testing and accept measurement of maternal serum
alphafetoprotein (MSAFP) testing when it is offered to them. Nancy
Press and Carole Browner (1995) have used qualitative evidence to
argue that women tend to see the choice to accept MSAFP tests as the
&ldquo;responsible&rdquo; choice that &ldquo;protects the
health&rdquo; of their babies, even though the only intervention
available in the case of a positive test (indicating a neural tube
defect) is abortion. Several authors have pointed out that increased
routine medical surveillance during pregnancy has put new pressure on
women to shoulder the responsibility for producing socially
acceptable, productive citizens, and for disciplining their own bodies
and laying them open to medical intervention and surveillance in
accordance with this goal (Tremain 2006, Kukla 2005, Roberts 2009).
The availability and routinization of PT may thus compromise
women&rsquo;s autonomy in some ways while increasing it in others. As
testing and abortion for fetal anomalies becomes more common, women
who choose not to test, or who choose to carry an impaired fetus to
term, may face diminished support and increased blame for their choice
(Lawson 2003). PT can create unrealistic pressures on women to
emotionally bond with or disengage from their fetuses on cue (Kukla
2005a, Kukla 2008, Mitchell 2001), and to keep their relationship to
the pregnancy &lsquo;tentative&rsquo; until tests come back negative
(Katz-Rothman 1993).</p>

<h4>2.1.2 Issues for Future Children</h4>

<p>
A variety of ethical concerns have been raised with respect to how PT
may impact future children. Some authors worry that PT helps to
inculcate an inappropriate stance towards parenting: perhaps parents
will come to desire or expect that children will match an advance set
of idealized expectations, translating into an overly controlling
attitude towards their children later in life; perhaps when carrying
pregnancy to term becomes conditional upon the fetus having certain
traits, our love for our children once they are born may become
similarly conditional (Rothschild 2005; Asch and Wasserman 2005). At
the moment, almost all PT screens or diagnoses well-defined medical
disorders such as Down syndrome and Tay-Sachs disease. Ethical
concerns will likely become yet more acute as the technology develops,
particularly if it extends to testing for traits that are not clearly
pathological, such as homosexuality, aggression, or a propensity to
obesity.</p>

<p>
It is often argued that it is wrong to bring a child with a disability
into the world if we can avoid doing so (i.e. Savulescu 2001, 2007;
Davis 2001). However, this claim is sometimes considered in tension
with the much discussed &ldquo;nonidentity problem&rdquo;, introduced
by Derek Parfit (1976, 1984) and adapted to the reproductive ethics
context by many authors (e.g., Steinbock 2009, Wasserman 2005, Brock
1995) (see the entry on
 <a href="../nonidentity-problem/">the nonidentity problem</a>).
 In short, the problem is that you cannot harm a non-existent person
by bringing them into existence, unless the person&rsquo;s life is so
dreadful that nonexistence is preferable. Some philosophers take an
antinatalist stance, arguing that human life in general is prima facie
worse than non-existence (e.g., Benatar 2006), but it is far more
widely held that bringing a child into existence does not typically
count as harming that child. That life with a disability or chronic
illness is predictably worse than non-existence is not plausible for
most of the genetic mutations for which we test&mdash;notably
including Down syndrome, which is the most common target for testing
and abortion.</p>

<p>
Appeal to the nonidentity problem in reproductive ethics leads quickly
to results that many find philosophically puzzling or implausible. For
example, if a woman is carrying twins and requires a selective
abortion, and one of the fetuses is known to have a serious anomaly
while the other does not, many people feel it would be wrong to choose
to keep the fetus with the anomaly. And yet, the fetus with the
anomaly does not itself have the option of becoming an anomaly-free
child; it will either become a child with a disability or not exist at
all. We can be doing this child no harm by choosing it over its
healthy twin, and its twin, if it counts as a being that can be harmed
at all by being aborted, is not harmed in any extra way in virtue of
having a twin who will live with an anomaly. Another problem, raised
by Glover (1977): imagine that a woman is taking a medication that
will cause substantial fetal deformities if she conceives while taking
it, and need only wait until she finishes her course of medication to
conceive a child without this risk. Most of us feel that it would be
callous and unethical of her to deliberately conceive while taking the
medication. But why, exactly? Any child she conceives during this time
will have these limb deformities, but its other &lsquo;option&rsquo;
is nonexistence; and limb deformities, while burdensome perhaps,
don&rsquo;t make a life not worth living. She does not wrong
<em>the</em> <em>child</em> by conceiving it. Nor does she harm any
nonexistent child that she might have brought into existence later on,
for you cannot harm a nonexistent being. Variations on this problem
and its practical and theoretical implications have been widely
discussed and continue to feature in heated debates in bioethics
(e.g., Boonin 2014, McMillan 2014, Jecker 2012).</p>

<p>
According to this line of reasoning, going out of one&rsquo;s way to
create a disabled child through genetic engineering, selective
abortion, or preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) cannot count as
harming the child, since that particular child has no options for
existing other than as disabled. (This issue has most often come up
with respect to deaf parents, who sometimes prefer to have a deaf
child&mdash;e.g. in Wasserman and Asch 2012). And yet, many writers
have the strong intuition that intentionally creating a disabled child
is a wrong done <em>to the child</em>&mdash;for instance, Silvia
Camporesi (2010) argues that &ldquo;choosing deafness with PGD is
unjust toward [the child] because it is a broad limitation to a
&lsquo;reasonable array of different life plans&rsquo;.&rdquo; The
non-identity problem forces us to search for an explanation of what
sort of injustice this could be, given that <em>this</em> child could
have had no non-limited future to start with. Responses to the
non-identity problem may conclude that (1) indeed there is no wrong
done by bringing someone into the world in a way that compromises her
opportunities for flourishing (Heyd 2009), or that (2) the wrong
involved is not one done <em>to the child</em>&mdash;for instance, it
might be wrong on roughly consequentialist grounds (Brock 1995),
because it promotes problematic values or reflects unacceptable
motivations (Kumar 2003), or because it fails to promote the interests
of an alternative possible child (Holtug 2009), or (3) that the
non-identity problem is illusory, and that someone can indeed be
harmed by being brought into existence (Benatar 2006, Harman
2004).</p>

<p>
As Roberts and Wasserman (2009) note, different strategies for
resolving the non-identity problem emerge from different accounts of
harm&mdash;e.g. as concerning states of affairs, or as (uniquely)
concerning identifiable individuals&mdash;and will therefore have
distinctive implications for obligations of beneficence and
non-maleficence in reproduction. For some commentators, however,
debate surrounding the non-identity problem carries tenuous import for
real-life procreative decision-making, and offers little help to
prospective parents in addressing the ethical challenges associated
with reproduction (e.g. Overall 2012, 154). A strategy for addressing
the non-identity problem, then, is not equivalent to a strategy for
addressing the challenges of harms and benefits to future children for
prospective parents. (See the entry on

<h4>2.1.3 Social Concerns and the Disability Rights Critique</h4>

<p>
Many have worried that the increasing routinization of PT is
tantamount to eugenics. As the term is paradigmatically used, eugenics
involves an intentional, top-down planned social program for
engineering an entire population so as to eliminate or propagate
particular traits. Those defending either strong rights to procreative
liberty or strong responsibilities of procreative beneficence (e.g.
Robertson 1996, 2003; Savulescu 20007; Mills 2011; Elster 2011) defend
PT against charges that it should be understood as ethically
equivalent to eugenics by emphasizing the role of individual,
autonomous parental choices in controlling this technology. Yet some
doubt that any genuine procreative freedom is preserved when PT is
treated as required (e.g., Sparrow 2011). Many have argued that a kind
of bottom-up eugenics will be instituted through the routinization of
PGD and PT; as declining control and accepting devalued traits in
one&rsquo;s children become less socially acceptable choice for
prospective parents, some homogenization of the gene pool and
elimination of diversity will emerge regardless of whether this is
anyone&rsquo;s planned agenda (Tremain 2006, Rothschild 2005).
Furthermore, while individual parents may be free to decide whether or
not to avail themselves of tests, <em>which</em> tests are available
will likely reflect and entrench existing social norms regarding
valuable and disvaluable traits (Sparrow 2007, Malek 2010). Some have
argued that PT, particularly as linked with selective abortion, has
<em>expressive meaning</em> for <em>everyone</em> with that condition:
it symbolically suggests that not only this fetus&rsquo;s life but the
life of <em>anyone</em> who has this trait is not worth living or
preserving, perpetuating and reinforcing denigrating social attitudes
toward persons with disabilities (e.g. Saxton 2000, Edwards 2004,
Valentine 2024). Or, one might argue that it is the
<em>routinization</em> of testing&mdash;the practice of checking for a
condition and making abortion available as a &lsquo;normal&rsquo; part
of &lsquo;responsible&rsquo; prenatal care&mdash;is what has
expressive devaluing significance. It follows that individual
decisions to use these tests may collectively instantiate a eugenic
and/or ableist project that reflects these values, even if this
project does not belong to any centralized intentional agent. On the
other hand, it seems that we already engage in such
&lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; eugenics by taking steps to have children with
valued traits, whether by seeking out attractive mates or by taking
folic acid during pregnancy (Mahowold 2002). The question is, then,
whether the routinization of PT introduces eugenics in a new and
problematic way, and if so, whether this worry is sufficient to
override its advantages.</p>

<p>
A related but distinct critique of PT draws upon the disability
justice movement in order to critically question the increased
routinization of PT and selective abortion (Asch and Wasserman 2005,
Parens and Asch 2000). In general terms, the disability rights
critique raises the worry that PT and selective abortion risk further
stigmatizing disabled people and harming disability communities. It
points out that the <em>offer</em> of a prenatal test for a particular
trait is never neutral; it implies that a reasonable person might wish
to know whether her fetus has this trait, and that this information
might reasonably be the basis for a decision not to continue the
pregnancy. Although many contributors to the disability rights
critique of PT consider themselves firmly in favor of general abortion
rights, they share at least a <em>prima facie</em> worry about the
ethics of aborting fetuses on the basis of tests for future
disability. One such argument concerns the entrenchment of the medical
model of disability, according to which a disability is a pathology or
impairment of an individual body. On this model, the disabled person
is less able to perform various functions than the able-bodied person
due to these physical differences (rather than social or environmental
barriers and exclusion). Further, assuming it is the job of medicine
to fix bodies or at least minimize the undesirable effects of their
medical conditions, it is appropriate for doctors to fix or mitigate
disability when they can (Saxton 2000). The routinization of PT
arguably institutionalizes the idea that disability is a medical
condition detected at the level of the individual body, and entrenches
the practice of &lsquo;fixing&rsquo; disability through a medical
intervention&mdash;specifically, the extreme intervention of simply
eliminating the disabled body. According to the disability rights
critique, this limits our ability to imagine addressing and
alleviating disability at the social level.</p>

<p>
Some arguments suggest that the routinization of PT and abortion for a
particular condition will weaken the relevant disability community. PT
and abortion will come to be seen as the only responsible and socially
supported option, threatening quality of life and availability of
resources for those who remain, who may be faced with increased
stigmatization and less possibility for community. Some commentators
deny that things have gotten worse for people with disabilities since
selective abortion of fetuses with impairments has gained popularity
(e.g. Overall 2012, 166). However, the rarer a condition is, the less
social and political motivation will exist to provide resources,
support, tailored educational activities, and the like for those who
have it. A connected concern appeals to the distorting effect on
decision-making of current genetic counseling practices, which do not
include any exposure to people who have the tested-for conditions or
any discussion of the social resources available for families with
children with the conditions. Even supposedly nondirective counseling
often uses stigmatizing language to talk about disability and the
choice not to abort a fetus with a disabling trait, and reflects
unsupported negative judgments regarding the abilities of and quality
of life for persons with disabilities (Asch 2000, Madeo et al. 2011).
In order for genuinely informative and trusting interactions to take
place between counselors and prospective parents, however, counselors
must be equipped with &ldquo;disability competencies,&rdquo; which
involve experience with disabilities and understanding of how various
disabilities affect lives and families; improving counseling practices
will require mandatory training in these areas (Sanborn and Patterson
2014).</p>

<p>
A further argument (mentioned above) suggests that PT encourages an
inappropriately commodifying and perfectionist approach to potential
children: by allowing particular traits to determine reproductive
decision-making, potential parents adopt an attitude of conditional
acceptance that is directly at odds with the nurturing and devotion
children need to flourish (Asch and Wasserman 2005). Others, however,
question the requirement of so-called unconditional love, given that
this requirement has developed in a context where mothers are judged
by the completeness of their caregiving roles, and where other social
factors impeding good care and acceptance are ignored (e.g. Gedge
2011). Some critics of PT reject the assumption that bearing and
raising a child with a disability is inevitably more burdensome than
raising a non-disabled child&mdash;Marsha Saxton, for instance, argues
that it is not disability itself that burdens women who have disabled
children, but rather the unjust circumstances of caregiving, where
ongoing sacrifices are expected from mothers, and community resources
and support remain woefully inadequate (2000, 2006). However, as long
as this state of affairs remains, it is hard to deny that raising a
child with a disability can be a serious challenge for many
people.</p>

<p>
Assuming that we believe that some, but not all, prenatal tests should
continue to be available, we need to ask more specific questions: for
example, which traits and conditions we <em>ought</em> to be testing
for and which traits it is <em>permissible</em> to test for.
Disability theorists have worried that it seems nearly impossible, in
practice, to draw a line between acceptable and unacceptable tests.
Nearly all scholars agree that testing for Tay-Sachs or other diseases
that lead to a short life filled with intense suffering and no hope of
a cure is ethically acceptable, and nearly all agree that testing for
vanity traits such as eye color would be unacceptable. But when it
comes to deciding which conditions are &lsquo;serious&rsquo; enough to
warrant the availability of prenatal tests, there is little agreement.
Anywhere this line is drawn risks risks treating the
&lsquo;seriousness&rsquo; of a condition as a fixed medical fact
rather than as a potentially socially malleable state of affairs; and
further risks stigmatizing those with &lsquo;serious&rsquo; conditions
and belittling the challenges faced by those with
&lsquo;unserious&rsquo; conditions (Parens and Asch 2000). We also
need to settle which, if any, of these tests will be covered by
insurance, and how we want to manage the consequences of PT for later
insurability. We need to decide whether procreative liberty and
privacy rights give parents the right to test their fetuses for what
we might consider morally unacceptable reasons, such as sex-selection.
Finally, we must decide how we will manage and control the genetic
information that results from prenatal tests, which can have
significant consequences for other, genetically related family members
who might have a strong stake in knowing <em>or</em> in not knowing
this information. All of these questions are the subjects of vigorous
bioethical debate; a classic source that discusses all the above
issues is Buchanan et al. 2000. Other widely cited authors and
collections contributing to these discussions include Harris 2010 and
Shakespeare 2006.</p>

<h3 id="BirtModeDeli">2.2 Birth and Mode of Delivery</h3>

<p>
Disagreement between advocates for birth medicalization and
&lsquo;natural&rsquo; birth often centre upon the nature of
childbirth: a dangerous and abnormal process best managed by medical
experts in an institutional setting, or a &lsquo;natural&rsquo; and
&lsquo;normal&rsquo; bodily function requiring formal medical
intervention only in unusual cases? Proponents of
&lsquo;natural&rsquo; childbirth point out that current norms of
hospital birth often result in a cascade of interventions; recent
research points to routinization of interventions such as induction
and episiotomy, leading to medically unnecessary treatments for some
women and negative&mdash;or even traumatic&mdash;experiences of
hospital delivery. When misused, technology can subjugate women to
medical authority, undercut their sense of dignity and control, and
alienate them from the birth process; however, it can also be used to
enhance women&rsquo;s agency, alleviate fear, and mitigate the pain of
childbirth. Meanwhile, a relatively &lsquo;natural&rsquo; birth that
does not get caught up in a cascade of medical interventions can be
empowering. But natural childbirth advocates often paint an idealized
picture of how birth is <em>supposed</em> to proceed (see also
Crossley 2007), and treat &lsquo;success&rsquo; at natural childbirth
as a mark of maternal character (see also Kukla 2008). Women who for
various reasons&mdash;including pre-existing medical conditions or
various complications during labor&mdash;do not manage to have a
vaginal delivery free of pain medication and medical intervention may
feel that they have &lsquo;failed&rsquo; to give birth properly.
Lyerly (2006) argues that the problem with modern birthing practices
is not the use of technology or the lack of it <em>per se</em>, for
technology itself has no inherent meaning or import. Rather, the
problem lies in a culture of birth that is expert-centered rather than
patient-centered, and in the imbalance of power and control that then
arises. This perspective is at the heart of Emily Martin&rsquo;s
critique of hospital delivery norms, in which she compares the choice
of home-birth (and that of non-compliance with standard operating
procedures in hospital delivery) to political resistance. She
describes women&rsquo;s &lsquo;sabotage&rsquo; of hospital policies
and systems, including stalling going to the hospital as long as
possible by hiding the progress of labour, surreptitious eating and
drinking against nurses&rsquo; orders, and walking around the hospital
or taking long showers so that fetal monitors cannot be used (1989,
186&ndash;7). Women&rsquo;s interference with machines and sterile
tools is compared to Luddite attacks on machinery; and in the choice
of home-birth, &ldquo;there is perhaps the most effective tactic of
all, the equivalent of opening up your own shop or becoming your own
boss: never going to the hospital at all and having your baby at
home&rdquo; (1989, 143).</p>

<p>
Disrespect for patient autonomy in obstetric care has been a subject
of critique by feminist scholars and proponents of midwife-assisted
birth for several decades. Some have criticised the tendency to
pathologise deviations from statistical norms in the progression of
labour, noting that hospital policies often allow for little personal
variation from patient to patient; interventions such as induction,
administering of pitocin, or caesarean section may be encouraged or
even demanded if a labouring patient strays too far from the
standardised timeline. A systematic review of women&rsquo;s treatment
during childbirth across the globe found widespread reports of
patients &ldquo;feeling a loss of autonomy, including objectification
and disrespect of safe traditional practices and birthing positions,
which rendered them passive participants&rdquo; (Bohren et al 2015,
18). Another large-scale analysis found frequent reports that medical
service providers failed to meet professional standards of care in
childbirth, including refusals to provide pain relief and failure to
obtain informed consent; women reported that invasive examinations and
interventions such as episiotomy were carried out without explanation
or permission (Beck 2018, 99). Some writers have argued that the
over-medicalization of pregnancy and childbirth is not alone
responsible for disrespectful service provision, disregard for patient
autonomy, or obstetric abuse. They highlight the contributing effects
of pervasive normative stereotypes of appropriate maternal behaviour
as self-sacrificial, a perceived duty to protect the fetus from
&ldquo;irresponsible&rdquo; maternal choices, and widespread trends
within the broader sphere of medical service provision treating women
as unreliable in managing or reporting their own health (see e.g.
Baron 2019; Criado-Perez 2020; Kingma 2021).</p>

<p>
Advocates for midwife- or doula-assisted delivery (at home or in
midwifery centres) often present this as a more respectful and less
interventionist alternative to over-medicalized hospital delivery,
sometimes characterising this mode of delivery as
&ldquo;woman-centred.&rdquo; Proponents of the medical model of birth,
on the other hand, argue that while serious complications during labor
are reasonably rare, they can occur quickly and their effects can be
catastrophic, and it is simply good risk reasoning to have the
expertise and resources of high-tech medicine available during labor.
Some ethicists go so far as to argue that physicians have a moral
responsibility to refuse to attend home birth. The choice of home
birth over hospital delivery is framed here as a matter of the
patient&rsquo;s subjective desires (regarding childbirth experience)
being prioritised unreasonably over the needs and wellbeing of the
fetus (see e.g. Chervenak et al 2013; Mat&#283;jek 2014). The attitude
that childbirth is always a potential medical emergency, and that
hospital delivery is therefore the only responsible choice, underlies
laws in some countries&mdash;such as the Czech Republic and
Hungary&mdash;which prohibit attendance at home births by midwives and
physicians (see Chen and Cheeseman 2017; Baron 2023b). Nonetheless,
even fervent critics of home-birth acknowledge evidence that
midwife-assisted home birth offers numerous benefits for labouring
patients: Lachlan de Crespigny and Julian Savulescu compare the choice
of home-birth to putting one&rsquo;s child in the car without a
seat-belt, but recognise that, &ldquo;Women have less pain at home and
increased satisfaction, plus fewer episiotomies, lacerations,
postpartum haemorrhages, retained placentae and infections&rdquo;
(2014, 3). Chervenak et al argue that physicians have a moral
responsibility to refuse to attend home birth, but suggest that,
&ldquo;Current, inappropriate practices may be fueling the
recrudescence of planned home birth. Physician leaders need to closely
scrutinize organizational policies and practices and should see to it
that staffing is competent and adequate&rdquo; (2013, 35).</p>

<p>
A further ethical debate surrounds the choice of caesarean delivery
for non-medical reasons. Empirical evidence does not decisively
support either vaginal or caesarean delivery as clearly superior. A
2006 NIH State of the Science conference assessed the available
scientific evidence concerning the short and long term risks to women
and infants of vaginal and surgical delivery, and concluded that there
was insufficient evidence to issue a recommendation concerning the
relative safety of planned vaginal and caesarean births. The most
comprehensive meta-analyses reveal different risks in each case that
are hard to commensurate and a dearth of high-quality data. Thus from
a narrowly medical evidence-based point of view there is no
justification for recommending one approach to delivery over the other
(Minkoff 2006, Lee and D&rsquo;Alton 2008). There is no validated and
universal medical code to indicate such deliveries, and therefore no
clear data showing whether elective caesareans (typically referred to
as Caesarean Deliveries on Maternal Request, or CDMRs) significantly
impact the overall caesarean rate. Nevertheless, some worry about the
prevalence of caesarean sections indicating the rise of a
technological imperative in standard obstetrical practice (Burrow
2012). Women who elect for caesarean deliveries without medical
necessity are sometimes stereotyped as &ldquo;too posh to push&rdquo;,
and seen as privileging their own convenience over their
children&rsquo;s well-being and their maternal responsibilities; these
narratives bear resemblances to those regarding women&rsquo;s choice
of home-birth over hospital delivery. However, as Elizabeth Chloe
Romanis and Anna Nelson note, the categorisation of CDMRs as
straightforwardly &ldquo;elective&rdquo; has problematic connotations.
It may obfuscate the fact that CDMRs are often chosen &ldquo;due to an
underlying health condition that, while not meeting the threshold of
severity to make caesarean a clinical <em>necessity</em>, is still
significant and might be impacted by vaginal delivery&rdquo;; and the
fact that whether a caesarean delivery is deemed medically necessary
is &ldquo;a matter of clinical discretion&rdquo; (2020, 726&ndash;7).</p>

<p>
Some of the ethical literature on this issue (Minkoff and Chervenak
2003, Schwartz 2004) takes it as obvious that incorporating CDMR into
obstetrical practice would enhance patient autonomy (by giving
pregnant women more options), and then asks whether this advantage is
offset by the harm of medically unnecessary surgery. But others have
argued that autonomy consists of more than choice, and that in social
context, making CDMR routinely available might actually impede
women&rsquo;s autonomy (Bergeron 2007; Kukla et al. 2009; Burrow
2012). Furthermore, the act of offering CDMR may itself contribute to
the normalization of technologically intensive birth and
medicalization&mdash;this would appear to be supported by the
widespread trend of growing rates of caesarean section mentioned above
(see Ghosh and James 2010; Betr&aacute;n et al. 2021). In a context
where doctors have high cognitive and social authority, and
technological intervention and management are associated with safety,
the offer of CDMR will not be a neutral offer but one that has
performative force and a normative valence: it may well alter the
patient&rsquo;s preferences and her understanding of what counts as a
socially sanctioned choice, creating &ldquo;a technological imperative
that cuts against autonomy&rdquo; (Burrow 2012, 45).</p>

<h3 id="FetuPati">2.3 The Fetus as Patient</h3>

<p>
Medical care for pregnant women generally impacts fetuses, whether by
design or as a side effect. Likewise, direct attempts to provide
medical assistance to fetuses inevitably impact the women in whose
bodies they reside. A recurring issue in obstetrical ethics concerns
whether and when the fetus should be conceptualized as a patient in
its own right. Doing so has substantive and complex implications for
doctors, who have distinctive duties to their patients, as well as
other possible legal and ethical consequences. In several papers (the
first published in 1996), Chervenak and McCullough have argued that
late-term, viable fetuses ought to be conceived of as patients who are
owed beneficence and respect for their (future) autonomy. A pre-viable
fetus, in their view, should become a patient if and only if the
pregnant woman autonomously chooses to grant it such status. Once the
fetus is a patient (a status that they consider to be distinct from
personhood), they argue that the doctor has a duty to try to protect
its well-being and balance its needs against the needs of the pregnant
woman.</p>

<p>
While at times the interests of the woman and the fetus may diverge,
typically these interests are inextricably related, both because
expectant mothers usually care intensely about fetal well-being, and
because protecting the health of the pregnant woman is typically the
best way to protect the health of the fetus (Mattingly 1992, Lyerly,
Little and Faden 2008a). Nevertheless, many feminist bioethicists have
been concerned that conceiving of the fetus as a separate patient
tends to imaginatively bolster the personification of the fetus; it
encourages conceiving of the mother and fetus as beings with entirely
separate interests, which may then be in conflict as easily as aligned
(Brione 2015; Baron 2019). Rebecca Brione suggests that &ldquo;at the
very least, it must be recognized that the ability and tendency to
view the unborn fetus as a separate person is likely to exert a subtle
bias on the patient&rsquo;s decision-making, which must be recognized
if such decision-making is to be truly autonomous&rdquo; (2015, 75).
Elselijn Kingma points out that the nature of maternity care makes it
unique &ldquo;in that it harms one patient (the mother) not primarily
for the promotion of her own health but for the benefit of another
(the baby)&rdquo; (2021, 456). Although in other medical contexts,
such as living-donor transplantation, this is recognised as a factor
demanding particularly careful attention to informed consent and the
protection of autonomy. However, in maternity care, &ldquo;the
altruistic sacrifice is deemed normative; its ethical legitimacy is
assumed; and consent procedures are often minimal or absent&rdquo;
(2021, 459).</p>

<p>
Maternal-fetal surgery to correct serious anatomical anomalies (such
as spina bifida) is a relatively new field of medicine, evolving
through experimental interventions. Such procedures were originally
known&mdash;and widely continue to be known&mdash;as &lsquo;fetal
surgery&rsquo;, a label that overlooks the fact that, in all fetal
surgeries the pregnant woman undergoes surgery herself. This may be
more or less invasive: open fetal surgery involves the opening of the
uterus (and demands that this and any future babies are delivered by
caesarean section); fetoscopic surgery is minimally invasive, and
requires only small incisions. Early assessments of &lsquo;fetal
surgery&rsquo; considered only the risks and potential benefits to
fetuses, while the medical consequences for women were understudied
and received short shrift in the informed consent process (Lyerly and
Mahowald 2001). At a 2000 conference on &lsquo;fetal surgery&rsquo; at
Vanderbilt University, Susan Wolf suggested the switch to the term
&lsquo;maternal-fetal surgery&rsquo;; this terminology was adopted by
the NIH, and by many&mdash;though not all&mdash;practitioners and
commentators (ibid). However, even the switch to describing such
surgeries as involving two patients whose well-being must be weighed
separately may be insufficient, since this language may still
reproduce a conceptual separation: &ldquo;there is little terminology
available that allows us to discuss the maternal-fetal relationship
without seeming to refer to two entities&rdquo; (Baron 2019, 492). In
both theory and practice, maternal-fetal surgery raises a number of
ethical issues we discuss in this article, including questions
concerning pregnant women&rsquo;s autonomy, consent under social
pressure and in the shadow of powerful social values, and attitudes
towards disability (Antiel 2016).</p>

<p>
One such question concerns the extent to which <em>offering</em>
maternal-fetal surgical interventions presupposes burdensome normative
stereotypes of maternal love and self-sacrifice, and of the relative
importance of (a) fetal prospects and (b) the best interests of a
pregnant patient. This applies not only to existing forms of
maternal-fetal surgery, but also to experimental forms and to
potential future uses of such techniques in the context of
ectogestational intervention (that is, the use of external gestation
environments). Considering this latter possible context, Claire Horn
describes the emotional force of motherhood as something that would
sway her own decision-making: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that
individual doctors should be permitted to run untested experimental
interventions on preterm babies under any circumstances [...] But I
also know that if the preterm baby in question was my baby, the
actual, tangible baby that I have been carrying for months, then I
might feel differently. I might say yes to something that had never
been tested, or attempted only once on animals, if I was offered the
narrow possibility that it could work&rdquo; (2023, 38). We need not
assume that maternal love will necessarily sway the reasoning of every
patient; acknowledging that it will have a powerful influence on
patient deliberations in some cases is enough to suggest that even
offering experimental interventions in the field of maternal-fetal
surgery has potential to constrain women&rsquo;s autonomy and not only
to expand it. We noted above that the disability rights critique of PT
argues that the offer of a prenatal test for some trait is not
neutral; on the same argument, the offer of (established or
experimental) maternal-fetal surgical interventions implies that a
reasonable mother might accept risks to her own health and well-being
for the sake of the fetus.</p>

<h2 id="CompPregWomeAuto">3. Compromises of Pregnant Women&rsquo;s Autonomy</h2>

<p>
When a pregnant woman is decisionally competent, health care
practitioners and ethicists strongly privilege her right to make final
treatment decisions in complicated cases where her interests may
conflict with those of her future child (although see section 3.2
below). But when the pregnant woman has diminished or no autonomy, the
situation is murkier. In this section, we take up ethical issues that
arise in the medical management of pregnant women who are decisionally
impaired, as well as the question of whether it is ever ethically
justifiable to override a pregnant woman&rsquo;s autonomous refusal of
medical intervention for the sake of the well-being of her fetus.</p>

<h3 id="IncaForAutoPregDeciImpaWome">3.1 Incapacity for Autonomy: Pregnancy in Decisionally Impaired Women</h3>

<p>
When a patient is decisionally impaired or incapacitated, ethical
dilemmas concerning medical decision-making arise: Should the patient
be included in decision-making in a limited way, to the best of her
abilities, or should paternalistic decision-making take over? Should a
proxy decision-maker make choices on the basis of the patient&rsquo;s
best interest, or by simulating as best she can the autonomous
decision that the patient would have made, had she been in a position
to make one? Such issues are familiar in the context of end of life
care and care for children and the cognitively impaired.</p>

<p>
When a pregnant woman is decisionally impaired or incompetent,
however, there are extra layers of ethical complexity to contend with;
her treatment typically affects not only her, but also her child
to-be. The developing fetus clearly has welfare (or at least future
welfare) interests, but no capacity for autonomous choice, and we have
no formula for combining its interests and moral claims with those of
the mother. For extra complication, the well-being of the child to-be
is typically not independent of the well-being of its mother. Further
ethical issues may arise in cases where, prior to serious decision
impairment (due, for example, to massive brain injury or brain death),
the pregnant woman has autonomously expressed her preference to
continue to gestate and give birth. In such cases, ethicists at both
the clinical and policy-making level may face questions about how to
respect the pregnant woman&rsquo;s autonomy while balancing concerns
for the potential child. They may be required to consider how external
factors such as available caregivers for the potential child may
factor into the possibility and desirability of going forward with the
pregnancy. Thus doctors must balance autonomy-based and
beneficence-based obligations to the pregnant woman, along with
beneficence-based obligations to the fetus (e.g. Coverdale et al.
2004).</p>

<h4>3.1.1 Pregnancy in Fully Incapacitated Women</h4>

<p>
Cases have arisen in which a pregnant woman has zero decisional
capacity and no hope of future agency, for instance when she is in a
long-term persistent vegetative state or has suffered frontal brain
death and is being kept alive artificially (for discussion of recent
case studies see, e.g., Warren et al. 2021). The central questions
raised in such cases include whether it is ethical to keep a pregnant
woman alive for the sole purpose of continuing the pregnancy, who
should make this determination, and which considerations should factor
into that decision. Some such cases demonstrate the continuing power
of fetal protection legislation in contexts where anti-abortion laws
are in place. For example, in 2013, a woman from Texas became
brain-dead at 14 weeks pregnant, and was kept on life-support against
her and her family&rsquo;s wishes, until it was established that her
fetus was also brain dead (Ecker 2014); a similar case took place in
Ireland a year later (Hurley 2015).</p>

<p>
In some of these cases, questions about how to include the
woman&rsquo;s voice or respect her agency are off the table, and her
welfare interests, if any, are minimal. She has no conscious
experience or future narrative to protect. We may, however, believe
that she still has interests in dignity and in having her former
narrative and values respected. Protecting these interests may
preclude certain forms of treatment of the dead, including
artificially continuing pregnancy (Sperling 2006, 77&ndash;80).
Protecting these interests may also, conversely, raise issues
regarding performing abortions on pregnant women who have become brain
dead (Watt 2016, 57&ndash;58). Some feel that it is unacceptable to
use a pregnant woman&rsquo;s body as a mere means by continuing her
life solely for its incubation function (see e.g., Lindemann Nelson
1994; Purdy 1994). Lindemann Nelson argues that the woman no longer
exists as a person of the sort that can have agent-relative duties
towards her fetus; she worries, furthermore, that such extraordinary
measures help enforce an image of the fetus as already a person with a
claim on resources as large as or even larger than that of existing
persons.</p>

<p>
This image seems to underpin arguments in favour of forced
interventions such as cesarean section for the sake of fetal benefit
when a pregnant patient refuses to accept medically advised
interventions (see e.g. Savulescu 2007a; Deshpande and Oxford 2012).
In the context of forced treatment of living women&mdash;whether
considered legally competent or otherwise&mdash;&ldquo;recent fetal
protection efforts seem to hold pregnant women to significantly
greater responsibilities to their fetuses than parents to their living
children&rdquo; (Baron 2023a, 66). However, in cases in which the
pregnant patient has suffered brain-death or similar, it is difficult
to analogise obligations to the fetus and obligations to one&rsquo;s
living child; it is far more conceivable that a court would mandate
the donation of a brain-dead parent&rsquo;s blood or organs to their
sick child than that they would consider mandating such a donation by
a living parent. Anna Smajdor has recently argued that the use of
brain-dead women&rsquo;s bodies as fetal incubators could be
analogised to organ donation, calling this &ldquo;whole body
gestational donation&rdquo; (2022); whilst this argument prompted
controversy, it raises the question of whether objection to one, but
not the other, is more a symptom of moral squeamishness than of a
clear distinction in the ethics of our instrumental use of deceased
persons&rsquo; bodies.</p>

<p>
Others might argue that if the father-to-be wants to raise his child,
it is callous to deny the child-to-be its chance at life and the
father his chance at parenthood in virtue of abstract concerns about
instrumentalism and respect. The woman will experience no extra
suffering, and no thwarting of her autonomous preferences, assuming
she left no advance directive&mdash;but here, it is important to note
there are still a large number of jurisdictions (including at least
thirty US states) in which authorities may invalidate the prior
advance directives of pregnant patients for the sake of fetal benefit
(Krause 2023, 807).</p>

<h4>3.1.2 Pregnancy in Decisionally Impaired Women</h4>

<p>
Pregnant women with limited capacity for autonomous agency and
decision-making (due to cognitive disability, mental illness, drug
use, etc.) still have the right to have their (limited) autonomy
respected and fostered to the largest extent possible. At the same
time, both they and their future children must be protected somehow
from harms that bad choices stemming from decisional impairment could
cause. Such women are often particularly socially vulnerable and
frequent targets of manipulation; they face multiple barriers to
having their reproductive and sexual health needs recognized and met
(e.g. see Greenwood and Wilkinson 2013 on women with intellectual
disabilities). Protecting their agency and well-being as well as the
well-being of their future children can thus be a delicate
negotiation. Furthermore, physicians and family members may not be
neutral parties when it comes to assessing a pregnant woman&rsquo;s
level of decisional competence: if they disagree with her expressed
desires concerning her own care (for example, her opposition to
abortion, or refusal of medication or bed rest) or believe her choices
put her fetus at unacceptable risk, they may be motivated to
overestimate her level of decisional impairment, thereby justifying
paternalistically overriding her expressed wishes.</p>

<p>
In the UK case <em>NHS Trust v JP</em> [2019] EWCOP 23, the court
approved a request to have a pregnant woman with learning disabilities
covertly placed under general anaesthetic and have her child delivered
by caesarean section, contrary to her express wishes. Williams J gave
approval for this order despite acknowledging that the young woman in
question, JP, was &ldquo;likely to experience distress, distrust,
anger, frustration at both the deception that may be necessary and the
carrying out of a surgical procedure against her will in respect of
such a profoundly important matter&rdquo; (&para;43, i). However, the
court&rsquo;s judgement&mdash;and that of the practitioners and family
members who had supported it&mdash;was proven unfounded when JP went
into labour ahead of her due date, attended hospital, and delivered a
healthy child through natural childbirth without any need for sedation
or restraint.</p>

<p>
Douglas Diekema (2003) points out that decisional capacity is not a
threshold capacity, and that it may fluctuate with timing, context,
and type of decision. Hence, in settling on how much paternalism is
appropriate in managing a decisionally impaired patient, doctors have
a responsibility to try to find a time and approach that will promote
and assist rather than foreclose the possibility of the
patient&rsquo;s meaningful autonomous participation in medical
decision making. Facilitating patients&rsquo; autonomy in reproductive
decision-making while protecting their best interests is perhaps
especially challenging in cases where mood or personality disorders
may erratically influence decision-making capacity (e.g. Zalpuri et
al. 2015). Coverdale et al. (2004) argue that respecting the autonomy
of decisionally compromised patients involves actively working towards
removing or diminishing circumstantial and reversible barriers to
participation in decision-making. This might include education,
creative forms of involvement in decision-making from loved ones,
postponing a medical decision until after psychotropic medication has
had time to become effective, accommodating a patient&rsquo;s special
needs for an environment conducive to making a decision, etc. The
presence of a fetus should not serve as ground for detracting from our
duty to protect a pregnant woman&rsquo;s right to participate in
decisions about her own care to whatever extent she is capable (which
is not to say that paternalistic interventions on behalf of her or her
fetus&rsquo;s welfare are never appropriate for decisionally impaired
women).</p>

<h3 id="OverAutoForcInteDuriPreg">3.2 Overriding Autonomy: Forced Interventions During Pregnancy</h3>

<p>
When a decisionally competent pregnant woman refuses an intervention
that doctors judge provides a substantial benefit or life-saving
intervention for her fetus, is overriding her refusal ever ethically
justified? It is typically a sacrosanct principle in medical ethics
that patients have an absolute right to refuse medical interventions,
including life-saving interventions, if they make an autonomous,
informed, competent choice to do so. However, in the case of pregnant
women, this principle has been questioned and sometimes violated by
force in the name of protecting the fetus. Examples have included
forced cesarean deliveries, mandatory HIV testing, and life-saving
blood transfusions performed despite religious objections (Kingma and
Porter 2021; M&rsquo;hamdi and Beaufort 2021). In 2009, Samantha
Burton was forced to stay in hospital for prescribed bedrest when her
membranes ruptured at 25 weeks. Burton&rsquo;s competence was not in
doubt, but her interests in leaving the hospital (to return to her
other children and her job) were overridden because her fetus could be
exposed to greater risk if she failed to comply with bedrest orders.
The hospital&rsquo;s obstetrician testified in favour of court-ordered
care in the role of the fetus&rsquo;s attending physician, and the
judge ruled that any interventions required for the fetus should be
administered. A few days later the fetus was delivered by cesarean,
already dead. Another case concerned an asylum seeker in Ireland who
sought an abortion after discovering that she was pregnant as a result
of rape; despite finding that her life was indeed in danger, the
health authority refused her request. When, in protest, the woman
(known as Ms Y in court documents) went on hunger strike, a
court-ordered caesarean section was carried out against her will at 25
weeks gestation (Fletcher 2014). These cases illustrate the
restriction of pregnant women&rsquo;s rights to refuse interventions,
which have been treated as violable in cases where refusing care may
harm the fetus (for discussion see Cantor 2012; Flanigan 2016).</p>

<p>
Cases of forcing a manifestly competent pregnant woman to undergo an
intervention over her objections have been increasingly rare in the
last two decades. However, forced interventions are still sometimes
performed on women who are vulnerable due to poverty, mental illness,
immigration status, racism, etc. (Roth 2003, Roberts 1996). These
vulnerable women, whose contact with the health care system is more
likely to be fragmented, are more open to being assessed as
incompetent when their expressed decision differs sharply from the
judgment of medical professionals responsible for their care. Social
marginalization can create the appearance of incompetence, and it can
also genuinely hamper competence when it comes to negotiating
physician-patient interactions. Nevertheless, there is now widespread
legal and ethical agreement that pregnant women, as autonomous adults
and full citizens, do not lose their rights to privacy and bodily
integrity in light of their pregnancy. Even when the survival of a
fetus depends on a pregnant woman undergoing some intervention, she
can no more be compelled to consent to it than anyone else could be
compelled to undergo a medical intervention to save another person.
Although ordinary requirements for informed consent may be waived in
extreme emergencies&mdash;and childbirth may sometimes give rise to
such emergencies&mdash;Flanigan argues that this cannot justify
discounting patient autonomy or the need for consent, especially since
&ldquo;women in labor are more likely than other patients in emergency
situations to have a prior relationship with physicians, to take the
opportunity to prepare medical directives in advance, or to designate
a surrogate decision maker&rdquo; (2016, 231).</p>

<p>
Some authors have expressed concern that forcing interventions on
pregnant women for the sake of the fetus contributes to our cultural
imagining of the fetus as a full-fledged person who functions as a
patient with rights and medical needs equivalent to the woman&rsquo;s
own (Roth 2003, Baron 2019). Indeed, as Paltrow and Flavin discuss,
even embryos and fertilized eggs may enjoy the protections of
personhood status, albeit not as a result of formal legislation;
evidence suggests that wide acceptance of such extensions of
personhood will be particularly detrimental to the procreative
autonomy of vulnerable women (Paltrow and Flavin 2013). On the other
hand, some forced interventions are designed to improve the health of
the children that fetuses will become. If the fetus will survive,
there will eventually be a full-fledged person with interests that can
be harmed during pregnancy. So forced interventions do not
<em>necessarily</em> personify the fetus; they may instead force the
pregnant woman to sacrifice her own well-being or autonomy for the
sake of her future child. There may be good moral reasons why pregnant
women ought not to refuse various interventions in particular cases;
one might argue that, at least in the case of voluntary pregnancy, the
pregnant woman has taken on a special duty to protect the well-being
of her future child in continuing to be pregnant. Savulescu (2007a)
argues for a &lsquo;duty of easy rescue&rsquo;&mdash;regardless of
whether the fetus counts as a person, he claims, a pregnant woman has
a duty to allow acts that do not significantly harm her while
protecting her future child from significant harm. However, moral
obligation comes apart from legal compulsion. As Kingma and Porter
argue, there may be cases in which parents do have a moral obligation
to undergo surgical interventions for the sake of their children,
whether this is an obstetric intervention for a future child or a
donation or blood or tissue for a born child; however, &ldquo;a
positive answer to the question about moral duty does not directly
translate to an answer about the moral justification for
compulsion&rdquo; (2021, 283).</p>

<p>
Cases involving possible forced interventions on pregnant women are
often framed as instances of &lsquo;maternal-fetal conflict&rsquo;, in
which doctors or courts must adjudicate between the wishes of the
woman and the well-being or rights of the fetus. It has been argued
that such a framing implies an adversarial stance, and positions the
fetus as in need of rescuing from a callous mother (although it is
worth noting that in medical contexts, &lsquo;maternal-fetal
conflict&rsquo; also often refers to cases in which fetal development
compromises the health of the mother). Some authors conclude that the
very notion of maternal-fetal conflict ought to be discarded: not only
may it undermine pregnant women&rsquo;s autonomy, it falsely describes
the nature and source of the conflict, which is more often a conflict
between maternal wishes and the practitioner&rsquo;s prescriptions.
Baylis, Rodgers, and Young (2008) suggest that such disagreements are
perhaps better cast as <em>maternal-physician conflicts</em> than as
maternal-fetal conflicts. However, Bonnie Steinbock argues that the
original phrase may sometimes still be apt: &ldquo;it must be
recognized that a pregnant woman can have interests, including
entirely legitimate interests, which may conflict with what will
protect the life or health of her fetus [...] It is wishful thinking
to pretend that what is best for the pregnant woman is necessarily
best for the fetus or future child, or that what is best for the fetus
always promotes the pregnant woman&rsquo;s interests&rdquo; (2011,
156). In rare cases, such as some advanced cancers, treatment
decisions for a pregnant woman necessitate a choice between saving her
life and that of the fetus, or other dramatic trade-offs. In such
cases, there is general consensus that the primary consideration
should be saving the life of the mother (i.e. see Puls, Terry, and
Hunter 1997). Charles Weijer (1998) points out, however, that in some
cases a pregnant woman&rsquo;s decision to refuse treatment and
sacrifice herself for her child should be counted as an autonomous
decision worth respecting, and that we should not assume that only
self-interested decisions can be autonomous.</p>

<h2 id="ManaCommReprRisk">4. Managing and Communicating Reproductive Risk</h2>

<p>
The language of risk pervades our public discourse surrounding
pregnancy and birth, both currently and historically (e.g.
Hallgrimsdottir and Benner 2014; Stohl 2018; Klassen 2021). Where
cost-benefit analyses serve as paradigms of rationality and hallmarks
of efficiency, social problems are framed as exercises in risk
management. While most pregnancies in developed countries yield
healthy mothers and babies, pregnancy unavoidably involves risk for
women and fetuses alike. Many have argued that pregnant women (as
opposed to policy makers, fathers, industrial manufacturers, etc.) are
disproportionately burdened with the responsibility for managing
reproductive risk; they are often expected to survey and discipline
virtually all aspects of their bodies and lives in accordance with
elaborate, ever-proliferating, ever-changing rules of risk
minimization (Kukla 2008, Lyerly et al. 2009, Baron 2023a).</p>

<p>
Women generally care deeply about the well-being of their future
children, and hence are typically concerned with managing reproductive
risk. More broadly, as a social body, we have a strong collective
interest in the health and welfare of our future community members,
and hence reproductive risk is a matter of public concern. In managing
and communicating about reproductive risk, we face several challenges.
First and perhaps most obviously, while pregnant women and fetuses are
inextricably physically intertwined, the risks and potential benefits
to each of them of various actions, situations, and interventions are
typically different and can even be in tension. Managing risk can be
especially complicated and ethically charged given this entwinement of
two different sets of risks and potential benefits. Second, as will be
discussed below, there are various reasons why good-quality evidence
about reproductive risk is hard to come by, and hence we often must
make decisions about how to manage such risk under a great deal of
uncertainty. Third, features of our cultural context can distort our
perceptions of reproductive risk (Drabble et al. 2011). Such
distortions become ethically relevant to the extent that they either
lead us to decisions that are not, as they purport to be, in the best
interests of babies or their mothers, or that place inappropriate
burdens and responsibilities on pregnant women that are not responsive
to reality. The following sections survey some ethical issues that
highlight these barriers to high-quality reasoning about reproductive
risk.</p>

<h3 id="AlcoDrugUseDuriPreg">4.1 Alcohol and drug use during pregnancy</h3>

<p>
Pregnant women who use alcohol and drugs violate deeply held cultural
visions of appropriate motherhood. We tend to frame any level of
drinking or drug use during pregnancy as indicating serious maternal
irresponsibility. The United States and Canada advocate <em>total</em>
abstinence from drinking during pregnancy, or even when becoming
pregnant is a possibility; campaigns by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention have encouraged women to attend to their
&ldquo;preconception health&rdquo; by cultivating fetus-friendly
habits (including ceasing use of cigarettes and alcohol) before they
even become pregnant (Waggoner 2015). And yet, although it is
well-established that heavy alcohol use during pregnancy (particularly
among those who smoke and experience further stressors such as
poverty) can result in Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, researchers have
repeatedly failed to find concrete evidence of fetal harm from light
to moderate maternal drinking (Armstrong 2003, Lee 2009). In 2014, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released an extensive study
showing no measurable ill effects on children from light maternal
drinking. Two years later, the Center released an advisory telling
<em>all</em> women who could become pregnant to abstain
<em>entirely</em> from drinking, whether or not they were or planned
to become pregnant (CDC April 2014, February 2016).</p>

<p>
It is tempting to think that even if light drinking or drug use poses
only a small teratogenic risk, women are morally obligated to refrain
from it. For instance, Elizabeth Harman (1999) claims that
<em>any</em> smoking during a pregnancy one plans to carry to term is
&ldquo;morally impermissible&rdquo;, and Gilmore (2008) argues that
women who are or might become pregnant ought to abstain from drinking
any alcohol. But we cannot, of course, ask pregnant women to abstain
completely from all voluntary activities carrying some fetal risk, for
they would be paralyzed into inactivity (which would itself come with
some risk). We are not nearly so draconian in our attitudes towards
other risky behaviors during pregnancy, such as driving a car, playing
sports, or travelling abroad, although (as noted above) pregnant women
still experience a broad range of social pressures and scrutiny
regarding day-to-day activities and habits. This does not only touch
behaviours considered to carry risks of fetal harm, but also applies
to steps that <em>could</em> be taken to benefit the fetus. Fiona
Woollard argues that there is a general assumption &ldquo;operating in
academic literature, medical advice given to mothers, mainstream media
and social media&rdquo; that an expectant mother has a general duty to
do anything that could benefit her fetus, and otherwise must have a
good reason justifying her failure to do so (2018, 126). This
assumption &ldquo;has pernicious effects on mothers and gender
equality, contributing to a culture of pervasive guilt and continuous
self-sacrifice that undermines women&rsquo;s emotional wellbeing and
discourages pursuit of career or other nondomestic goals&rdquo;
(ibid).</p>

<p>
The failure of extreme risk-aversion strategies to reliably decrease
harmful behaviours and contribute to positive health outcomes for
pregnant women and their fetuses should lead practitioners and
researchers toward alternative approaches to understanding,
communicating about, and managing risks for pregnant women (Ballantyne
et al. 2016). Alternative approaches call for clearer understanding of
fetal risk among both clinicians and policy makers, and explicit
consideration of the social and political values that shape current
forms of risk management in pregnant women (Minkoff and Marshall
2016). Elizabeth Armstrong (2003) and Janet Golden (2006) have argued
that widespread social anxiety over Fetal Alcohol Syndrome constitutes
a &lsquo;moral panic&rsquo; over mothers engaging in what we imagine
as self-indulgent or decadent behavior, rather than an evidence-based
response to risk. Focusing on the consumption of alcohol or drugs as a
particularly pernicious form of risk-taking seems to have more to do
with images and ideologies of maternal self-sacrifice, purity, and
decadence than with rational concern for fetal well-being. This is
especially visible in responses to drug abuse in pregnant women: Iris
Marion Young describes the &ldquo;particular rage&rdquo; directed at
these women&mdash;often greater, she argues, than that directed
against other criminals&mdash;which, she suggests, responds
specifically to their <em>motherhood</em>. This rage
&ldquo;unconsciously recalls the feeling we all had as children of
rage toward our mothers who were not always there for us, did not
always respond to our needs and desires, and sometimes pursued their
own purposes and desires&rdquo; (1994, 36).</p>

<p>
Many states have tried (successfully, in some cases) to prosecute
pregnant drug users for separate crimes beyond illicit drug use, such
as child abuse or fetal endangerment (Goodwin 2014; Cosgrove and
Vaswani 2020). In one Indiana, US case, a woman who procured a medical
abortion was found guilty of both neglect of a dependent child
<em>and</em> feticide; she successfully appealed these charges in 2016
(for discussion, see Milne 2020, 182&ndash;7). Not infrequently,
pregnant drug users have had their children removed from their care at
birth, or have been coerced into treatment. These forms of
intervention may have the opposite of the desired effect, by
discouraging pregnant women who use drugs and alcohol from seeking
prenatal care or obtaining support that would help with drug use
cessation (Roberts and Pies 2011; Terplan, Kennedy-Henricks and
Chisolm 2015; Haffajee et al. 2021; Weber et al. 2021). On empirical
study across eight US states found that punitive policies that
&ldquo;criminalized substance use during pregnancy, considered it
grounds for civil commitment, or considered it child abuse or
neglect&rdquo; were associated with higher rates of neonatal
abstinence syndrome among neonates (Faherty et al. 2019). In addition
to creating barriers to effective prenatal care, punitive and coercive
approaches to drug use during pregnancy may inappropriately diminish
women&rsquo;s agency and misconstrue the interests of pregnant women
who use drugs (Olsen, Banwell, and Madden 2014). Punitive approaches
imply that pregnant addicts are &lsquo;choosing&rsquo; their own
pleasure over their children&rsquo;s well-being; however, drug use
among addicts is rarely a voluntary choice based on a rational
assessment of the risks and potential benefits of drug use.
Accordingly, some argue that punitive measures against pregnant women
addicted to drugs are inherently unjust, especially when taken in a
system that fails to meet the basic health needs of marginalized women
and children (Flavin and Paltrow 2010). Poor and minority pregnant
women are disproportionately tested for drugs and threatened with
punishment, even though they use drugs at rates no higher than their
white, middle-class counterparts, and hence a punitive approach is
likely to be unjustly applied (see also Hans 1999).</p>

<p>
Iris Marion Young distinguishes between three approaches to drug abuse
during pregnancy: punishment, treatment, and empowerment (1994). As do
many of the scholars mentioned above, she rejects the punishment
approach as both immoral and impractical. However, she expresses
reservations about the treatment approach as currently practiced; she
argues that it still treats addiction as an individual, medicalized
health problem, rather than as a social problem. An empowerment
approach of the sort that Young favors offers treatment, but in the
context of a project of social empowerment and consciousness-raising
designed to foster a critically reflective &ldquo;sense of collective
influence over the social conditions of one&rsquo;s life&rdquo; (Young
1994, 48). She advocates programs that help women develop a
perspective from which overcoming addiction can be understood not just
as an individual health or will-power problem, but as part of a shared
project of personal and community transformation.</p>

<h3 id="ReseMediTreaInvoPregWome">4.2 Research and Medical Treatment Involving Pregnant Women</h3>

<p>
Up until the early 1990s, women were dramatically underrepresented in
clinical research trials. Historically, the two most common reasons
given for women&rsquo;s default exclusion were their purportedly more
complicated and variable hormonal patterns and the possibility that
they might be or become pregnant during the study, which could harm
the fetus (Giacomini and Baylis 2003; Criado-Perez 2020). The National
Institutes of Health solicited a report from the Institute of Medicine
in 1992 on the effects upon women&rsquo;s health of these routine
exclusions, and the report concluded that serious harms were being
done to women, who were disproportionately denied the direct benefits
that might come from study participation. Their systematic exclusion
from clinical trials meant that medical service providers did not know
how to design appropriate treatment plans for women, whose different
hormones and reproductive system, longer life span, and other
medically relevant differences meant that treating them as
&lsquo;smaller men&rsquo; for the purposes of dosing drugs and other
treatment decisions was medically unsound. In 1993, the NIH changed
its policies to make inclusion of women the default in all research,
variation from which requires explicit justification. Constance Holden
(2008) reported that as of 2006, women comprised 68.9% of participants
in clinical trials. However, some argue that women continue to be
significantly outnumbered by male subjects in biomedical research and
clinical trials generally; these commentators suggest that
women&rsquo;s inclusion rates were artificially inflated by a small
number of single sex studies (Kim, Tingen, and Woodruff 2010).
Moreover, disclosure of inclusion practices and rates in clinical
trials is unreliable, and recent reviews fail to confirm reports of
significant progress in diverse inclusion (Woodruff et al. 2015,
Geller et al. 2011).</p>

<p>
In any case, pregnant women remain an official &lsquo;vulnerable
group&rsquo; under the federal policies governing human subjects
research, and are exempt from the inclusion mandate. Indeed, virtually
all clinical research excludes pregnant women out of purported concern
for teratogenic effects on fetuses, while even trials for
interventions not classified as potentially teratogenic routinely
exclude pregnant women (Shields and Lyerly 2013). Ongoing exclusion
stymies development of safe and effective medical interventions for
pregnant women, whose metabolism, blood volume, hormones, immune
system, and other bodily systems are affected by pregnancy in ways
that impact their response to medication (Blehar et al. 2013). While
the lacuna of reliable evidence regarding safe and effective medical
interventions for pregnant women and their fetuses is widely
acknowledged as a problem, it has not, in general, shaken the
consensus that it is unethical to put fetuses at unknown risk for the
purposes of research. As a result, &ldquo;the majority of medicines
are administered in pregnancy &lsquo;off-label&rsquo;, and over 90% of
clinically approved drugs lack appropriate information on efficacy,
safety, teratogenicity and pharmacokinetics in pregnancy&rdquo;
(Scaffidi et al. 2016, 132).</p>

<p>
Advice for pregnant women is generally conservative; women are advised
to avoid medical interventions and medications during pregnancy if at
all possible. For example, women with mental illnesses such as bipolar
disorder and depression are often counseled to avoid medication during
pregnancy, both because psychotropic drugs tend to diffuse readily
across the placenta, and because typically, the mental state of the
mother does not <em>directly</em> impact the health of the fetus (in
contrast with, for instance, diabetes or life-threatening cancer).
However, mental illness in pregnant women matters to fetal
development: untreated depression, for example, is associated with
premature birth, low birthweight, and other complications (Gold and
Marcus 2008). Moreover, some researchers argue that evidence for
negative health outcomes for children born from women taking
anti-depressants is scant and unreliable, and provides little guidance
for treatment (Byatt, Deligiannidis, and Freeman 2013, Pearlstein
2015). Without improved evidence, it is difficult to give any rules of
thumb for the ethics of treating mental illness during pregnancy.
Similar problems can be found across the medical spectrum:
&ldquo;pregnant women remain therapeutic orphans, with the vast
majority of current accepted therapies for medical conditions never
having been studied in pregnancy&rdquo; (Costantine et al. 2020,
2).</p>

<p>
As well as a widespread failure to investigate the efficacy and safety
of non-pregnancy-related drugs for use by pregnant women, there is
also little pregnancy-related drug-trial activity (compared with
non-pregnancy-related pharmaceutical interventions). For example,
although pre-eclampsia and lung cancer have very similar incidence
rates (approximately 42 in 100,000 and 43 in 100,000 the total
population respectively, according to Australian data) a study of the
five largest interventions databases found nearly 50 times as many
lung-cancer-focused drug trials as pre-eclampsia-focused trials active
in the period 2013&ndash;14 (Scaffidi et al. 2016, 137). Existing gaps in
medical research observed regarding problems exclusive (or
near-exclusive) to the female body, such as pre-menstrual syndrome and
dysmenorrhea, have been highlighted in recent years (see e.g.
Criado-Perez 2020; White and Clayton 2022). The relative dearth of
research into pharmaceutical interventions for pregnancy-related
morbidities may be grounded in the same longstanding inattentiveness
to female medical needs, but is likely to be confounded by the ethical
issues discussed above regarding research risks for pregnant women and
fetuses.</p>

<p>
The conservative approach to doing research with/ treating women
during pregnancy generally emphasizes the risks to fetuses from
intervening, but not the risks from not intervening (Lyerly, Little,
and Faden 2008b). When we exclude pregnant women from research or
discourage treatment because of a lack of knowledge about the effects
of a medication, we are not typically erring on the side of fetal
<em>safety</em>; rather, we generally have no idea whether it is
riskier for the fetus to be exposed to a medication or to the effects
of untreated maternal morbidity. As Lyerly, Little and Faden point
out, &ldquo;If research is important to tell us when medications are
unsafe, it is also important to reassure us when drugs <em>are</em>
safe &hellip; In the absence of information about the safety and
efficacy of medications, pregnant women and their providers are left
with two unsavory options&mdash;take a drug, with unknown safety and
efficacy; or fail to treat the conditions, thus leaving the woman and
fetus vulnerable to the consequences of the underlying medical
problems&rdquo; (Lyerly, Little and Faden 2008b, 12, 19). Pregnant
women who have medical needs during pregnancy are typically told to
weigh the risks and benefits when deciding whether to proceed with a
treatment whose impact on fetuses is unknown. But this is an
impossible demand; no one can weigh unknown risks and benefits, and
excluding pregnant women from research sustains the impossibility of
this calculation.</p>

<p>
It is unclear, however, how best to craft appropriate standards for
inclusion. Not only is the random exposure of fetuses to unknown
teratogenic risks ethically problematic, but few pregnant women are
likely to enroll in such trials. Some bioethicists propose ethical
guidelines for inclusion of pregnant women in clinical trials that
attend to both the woman and her fetus as patients (Chevernak and
McCullough 2011). As others point out in response, however, the fetus
as patient approach will likely entail continuing strict limitations
on clinical trial participation, including in cases where the
intervention in question is potentially life-saving for the pregnant
woman but risky to the fetus. The approach does not resolve the
problem of pregnant women&rsquo;s exclusion from medical research
participation and associated health impacts; we are in need of new
practices and policies that are sensitive to the difficulties and
dangers of research on pregnant women, but are undistorted by
assumptions that it is always more responsible and safer to protect
fetuses from unknown interventions (White 2015).</p>

<h1>Human Rights</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Feb 7, 2003; substantive revision Fri May 31, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Human rights are norms that aspire to protect all people everywhere
from severe political, legal, and social abuses. Examples of human
rights are the right to freedom of religion, the right to a fair trial
when charged with a crime, the right not to be tortured, and the right
to education. The philosophy of human rights addresses questions about
the existence, content, nature, universality, justification, and legal
status of human rights. The strong claims often made on behalf of
human rights (for example, that they are universal, inalienable, or
exist independently of legal enactment as justified moral norms) have
frequently provoked skeptical doubts and countering philosophical
defenses (on these doubts see Lacroix &amp; Pranch&egrave;re 2016;
Mutua 2002; and Waldron 1987). Reflection on these doubts and the
responses that can be made to them has become a sub-field of political
and legal philosophy with a very substantial literature (see the
extensive
 <a href="#Bib">Bibliography</a>
 below). This entry addresses the concept of human rights, the
existence and grounds of human rights, the question of which rights
are human rights, and relativism about human rights.</p>

<h2 id="GeneIdeaHumaRigh">1. The General Idea of Human Rights</h2>

<p>
This section attempts to explain the general idea of human rights by
identifying four defining features. The goal is to answer the question
of what human rights are with a description of the concept rather than
with a list of specific rights. Two people can have the same general
idea of human rights even though they disagree about which rights are
really human rights and even about whether universal human rights are
a good idea. The four-part explanation just below attempts to cover
all kinds of human rights including both moral and legal human rights
as well as old and new human rights (e.g., both Lockean natural rights
and contemporary human rights). The explanation anticipates, however,
that particular kinds of human rights will have additional features.
Starting with this general concept does not commit us to treating all
kinds of human rights in a single unified theory (see Buchanan 2013
for an argument that we should not attempt to theorize together
universal moral rights and international legal human rights).</p>

<ul class="hanging">

<li><em>Human rights are rights</em> Lest we miss the obvious, human
rights are rights (see Cruft 2012 and the entry on
 <a href="../rights/">rights</a>).
 Rights focus on a freedom, protection, status, immunity, or benefit
for the rightholders. Most human rights are claim rights that impose
duties or responsibilities on their addressees or dutybearers. The
duties associated with human rights often require actions involving
respect, protection, facilitation, and provision. Although human
rights are usually mandatory in the sense of imposing duties on
specified parties, some legal human rights seem to do little more than
declare high-priority goals and assign responsibility for their
progressive realization. One can argue, of course, that goalish rights
are not real rights, but it may be better to recognize that they
comprise a weak but useful notion of a right. (See Beitz 2009 for a
defense of the view that not all human rights are rights in a strong
sense. Also, see Feinberg 1973 for the idea of &ldquo;manifesto
rights&rdquo; and Nickel 2013 for a discussion of &ldquo;rightslike
goals&rdquo;.)</li>

<li><em>Human rights are plural and come in lists</em> If someone
accepted that there are human rights but held that there is only one
of them, this might make sense if she meant that there is one abstract
underlying right that generates a list of specific rights (see Dworkin
2011 for a view of this sort). But if this person meant that there is
just one specific right such as the right to peaceful assembly this
would be a highly revisionary view. Some philosophers advocate very
short lists of human rights but nevertheless accept plurality (see
Ignatieff 2004).</li>

<li><em>Human rights are universal</em> All living humans&mdash;or
perhaps we should say all living <em>persons</em>&mdash;have human
rights. One does not have to be a particular kind of person or a
member of some specific nation or religion to have human rights.
Included in the idea of universality is some conception of independent
existence. People have human rights independently of whether such
rights are present in the practices, morality, or law of their country
or culture. This idea of universality needs several qualifications,
however. First, some rights, such as the right to vote, are held only
by adult citizens or residents and apply only to voting in one&rsquo;s
own country. Second, some rights can be suspended. For example, the
human right to freedom of movement may be suspended temporarily during
a riot or a wildfire. And third, some human rights treaties focus not
on the rights of everyone but rather on the rights of specific groups
such as minorities, women, indigenous peoples, and children.</li>

<li><em>Human rights have high-priority</em> Maurice Cranston held
that human rights are matters of &ldquo;paramount importance&rdquo;
and their violation &ldquo;a grave affront to justice&rdquo; (Cranston
1967: 51, 52). If human rights were not very important norms they
would not have the ability to compete with other powerful
considerations such as national stability and security, individual and
national self-determination, and national and global prosperity. High
priority does not mean, however, that human rights are absolute. As
James Griffin says, human rights should be understood as
&ldquo;resistant to trade-offs, but not too resistant&rdquo; (Griffin
2008: 77). Further, there seems to be priority variation among human
rights. For example, the right to life is generally thought to have
greater importance than the right to privacy; when the two conflict
the right to privacy will generally be outweighed.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s now consider five other features or functions that might
be added to these four.</p>

<ul class="hanging">

<li><em>Should human rights be defined as inalienable?</em>
Inalienability does not mean that rights are absolute or can never be
overridden by other considerations. Rather it means that its holder
cannot lose it temporarily or permanently by bad conduct or by
voluntarily giving it up. It is doubtful that all human rights are
inalienable in this sense. One who endorses both human rights and
imprisonment as punishment for serious crimes must hold that
people&rsquo;s rights to freedom of movement can be forfeited
temporarily or permanently by just convictions of serious crimes.
Perhaps it is sufficient to say that human rights are very hard to
lose. (For a stronger view of inalienability, see Donnelly 1989 [2020]
and Meyers 1985.)</li>

<li><em>Should human rights be defined as minimal rights?</em> A
number of philosophers have proposed the view that human rights are
minimal in the sense of not being too numerous (a few dozen rights
rather than hundreds or thousands), and not too demanding (see Joshua
Cohen 2004 and Ignatieff 2004). Their views suggest that human rights
are&mdash;or should be&mdash;more concerned with avoiding the worst
than with achieving the best. Henry Shue suggests that human rights
concern the &ldquo;lower limits on tolerable human conduct&rdquo;
rather than &ldquo;great aspirations and exalted ideals&rdquo; (Shue
1996: ix). When human rights are modest standards they leave most
legal and policy matters open to democratic decision-making at the
national and local levels. This allows human rights to have high
priority, to accommodate a great deal of cultural and institutional
variation among countries, and to leave open a large space for
democratic decision-making at the national level. Still, there is no
contradiction in the idea of an extremely expansive list of human
rights and hence minimalism is not a defining feature of human rights
(for criticism of the view that human rights are minimal standards see
Brems 2009; Etinson forthcoming; and Raz 2010). Minimalism is best
seen as a normative prescription for what <em>international</em> human
rights should be. Moderate forms of minimalism have considerable
appeal as recommendations, but not as part of the definition of human
rights.</li>

<li>

<p>
<em>Should human rights be defined as always being or
&ldquo;mirroring&rdquo; moral rights?</em> Philosophers coming to
human rights theory from moral philosophy sometimes assume that human
rights must be, at bottom, moral rather than legal rights. There is no
contradiction, however, in people saying that they believe in human
rights, but only when they are legal rights at the national or
international levels. As Louis Henkin observed,</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="subhang">
Political forces have mooted the principal philosophical objections,
bridging the chasm between natural and positive law by converting
natural human rights into positive legal rights. (Henkin 1978: 19)</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="subhang">
It has also been suggested that legal human rights can be justified
without directly appealing to any corresponding moral human right (see
Buchanan 2013).</p> </li>

<li><em>Should human rights be defined in terms of serving some sort
of political function?</em> Instead of seeing human rights as grounded
in some sort of independently existing moral reality, a theorist might
see them as the norms of a highly useful political practice that
humans have constructed. Such a view would see the idea of human
rights as playing various political roles at the national and
international levels and as serving thereby to protect urgent human
and national interests. These political roles might include providing
standards for international evaluations of how governments treat their
people and specifying when use of economic sanctions or military
intervention is permissible. This kind of view may be plausible for
the very salient international human rights that have emerged in
international law and politics in the last fifty years. But human
rights can exist and function in contexts not involving international
scrutiny and intervention such as a world with only one state.
Imagine, for example, that a massive asteroid strike makes New
Zealand the only remaining state in existence. Surely the idea of
human rights along with many dimensions of human rights practice
could continue in New Zealand, even though there would be no
international relations, law, or politics (for an argument of this
sort see Tasioulas 2012a). And if in the same scenario a few people
were discovered to have survived in Iceland and were living without a
government or state, New Zealanders would know that human rights
governed how these people should be treated even though they were
stateless. How deeply the idea of human rights must be rooted in
international law and practice should not be settled by definitional
fiat. We can allow, however, that the sorts of political functions
that Rawls and Beitz describe are typically served by international
human rights today.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ExisGrouHumaRigh">2 The Existence and Grounds of Human Rights</h2>

<h3 id="HowHumaRighExis">2.1 How Can Human Rights Exist?</h3>

<p>
The most obvious way in which human rights exist is as norms of
national and international law. At the international level, human
rights norms exist because of treaties that have turned them into
international law. For example, the human right not to be held in
slavery or servitude in Article 4 of the
 <a href="#ECHR">European Convention on Human Rights</a>
 and in Article 8 of the
 <a href="#ICCPR">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>
 exists because these treaties establish it. At the national level,
human rights norms exist because they have&mdash;through legislative
enactment, judicial decision, or custom&mdash;become part of a
country&rsquo;s law. For example, the right against slavery exists in
the United States because the 13th Amendment to the
 <a href="#USConstitution">United States Constitution</a>
 prohibits slavery and servitude. When rights are embedded in
international law, we are apt to speak of them as human rights; but
when they are enacted in national law we more frequently describe them
as civil or constitutional rights.</p>

<p>
Although enactment in national and international law is one of the
ways in which human rights exist, many have suggested that this is not
the only way. If human rights exist only because of enactment, their
availability is contingent on domestic and international political
developments. Many people have looked for a way to support the idea
that human rights have roots that are deeper and less subject to human
decisions than legal enactment. One version of this idea is that
people are born with rights, that human rights are somehow innate or
inherent in human beings (see Morsink 2009). One way that a normative
status could be inherent in humans is by being god-given. The
 <a href="#DoI">American Declaration of Independence</a>
 claims that people are &ldquo;endowed by their Creator&rdquo; with
natural rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. On this
view, god, the supreme lawmaker, enacted some basic human rights.</p>

<p>
Rights plausibly attributed to divine decree must be very general and
abstract (life, liberty, etc.) so that they can apply across thousands
of years of human history, not just to recent centuries. But
contemporary human rights are specific and many of them presuppose
contemporary institutions (e.g., the right to a fair trial, the right
to social security, and the right to education). Even if people are
born with god-given natural rights, we need to explain how to get from
those general and abstract rights to the specific rights found in
contemporary declarations and treaties.</p>

<p>
Attributing human rights to god&rsquo;s commands may give them a
secure status at the metaphysical level, but in a very diverse world
it does not make them practically secure. Billions of people today do
not believe in the god of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. If people
do not believe in god, or in the sort of god that prescribes rights,
then if you want to base human rights on theological beliefs you must
persuade these people to accept a rights-supporting theological view.
This is likely to be even harder than persuading them of human rights.
Legal enactment at the national and international levels provides a
far more secure status for practical purposes.</p>

<p>
Human rights could also exist independently of legal enactment by
being part of actual human moralities. All human groups seem to have
moralities, that is, imperative norms of behavior backed by reasons
and values. These moralities contain specific norms (for example, a
prohibition on the intentional murder of innocent persons) and
specific values (for example, valuing human life). One way in which
human rights could exist apart from divine or human enactment is as
norms accepted in almost all actual human moralities. If almost all
human groups have moralities containing norms that prohibit murder,
for example, these norms could constitute the human right to life.</p>

<p>
This view is attractive but has serious difficulties. Although
worldwide acceptance of human rights has increased in recent
decades (see below
 <a href="#UnivHumaRighWorlDiveBeliPrac">section 4. Universal Human Rights in a World of Diverse Beliefs and Practices</a>),
 worldwide moral unanimity about human rights does not exist. Human
rights declarations and treaties are intended to change existing
norms, not just describe an existing moral consensus.</p>

<p>
Yet another way of explaining the existence of human rights is to say
that they exist most basically in true or justified ethical outlooks.
On this account, to say that there is a human right against torture is
mainly to assert that there are strong reasons for believing that it
is always morally wrong to engage in torture and that protections
should be provided against its practice. This approach would view the
Universal Declaration as attempting to formulate a justified political
morality: that is, as not merely trying to identify a preexisting
moral consensus, but trying to create a consensus that could be
supported by very plausible moral and practical reasons. This approach
requires commitment to the objectivity of such reasons. It holds that
just as there are reliable ways of finding out how the physical world
works, or what makes buildings sturdy and durable, there are reliable
ways of finding out what individuals may justifiably demand of each
other and of governments. Even if unanimity about human rights is
currently lacking, rational agreement is available to humans if they
will commit themselves to open-minded and serious moral and political
inquiry. If moral reasons exist independently of human construction,
they can&mdash;when combined with premises about current institutions,
problems, and resources&mdash;generate moral norms different from
those currently accepted or enacted. The Universal Declaration seems
to proceed on exactly this assumption (see Morsink 2009).</p>

<p>
One problem with this view is that an existence based on good reasons
seems a rather thin form of existence for human rights. But perhaps we
can view this thinness as a practical rather than a theoretical
problem&mdash;that is, as something to be remedied by the formulation
and enactment of legal norms. The best form of existence for human
rights would combine robust legal existence with the sort of moral
existence that comes from being supported by strong moral and
practical reasons.</p>

<h3 id="JustForHumaRigh">2.2 Justifications for Human Rights</h3>

<p>
Justifications for human rights should identify plausible starting
points for defending the key features of human rights and offer an
account of the transition from those starting points to a list of
specific rights (see Nickel 2007). Further, justifying
<em>international</em> human rights is likely to require additional
steps (see Buchanan 2013). These requirements make the construction of
a good justification a daunting task.</p>

<p>
Recent attempts to justify human rights offer a dizzying variety of
grounds. These include prudential reasons; linkage arguments (Shue
1996); agency and autonomy (Gewirth 1996; Griffin 2008); basic needs
(D. Miller 2012); capabilities and positive freedom (Gould 2004;
Nussbaum 2000; and Sen 2004) dignity (Gilabert 2018b; Kateb 2011,
Tasioulas 2015); and fairness, status equality, and equal respect
(Dworkin 2011; Buchanan 2013).</p>

<p>
There is a lot of overlap between these approaches, but also important
differences that are likely to make them yield different results. For
example, an approach framed in terms of agency and autonomy will be
more strongly and directly supportive of fundamental freedoms than one
framed in terms of basic human needs. Justifications can be based on
just one of these types of reasons or be pluralistic and appeal to
several. Seeing so much diversity in philosophical approaches to
justification may be discouraging (although great disagreement in
approaches is common in philosophy) but its good side is that it
suggests that there are at least several plausible ways of justifying
human rights.</p>

<p>
Philosophical justifications for human rights differ in how much
credibility they attribute to contemporary lists of human rights, such
as the one found in the
 <a href="#UDHR">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>
 (1948). Some take fidelity to contemporary human rights practice as
nearly imperative while others prioritize particular normative
frameworks even if they can only justify some of the rights in
contemporary lists.</p>

<p>
Attempting to discuss all of these approaches would be a task for a
large book, not an encyclopedic entry. The discussion here is limited
to two approaches: agency/autonomy and dignity.</p>

<h4>2.2.1 Agency and Autonomy</h4>

<p>
Grounding human rights in human agency and autonomy has had strong
advocates in recent decades (Griffin 2008; Gould 2004). An important
forerunner in this area was Alan Gewirth. In <em>Human Rights: Essays
on Justification and Application</em> (1982), Gewirth argued that
human rights are indispensable conditions of a life as an agent who
survives and acts. Abstractly described, the conditions of such a life
are basic freedom and well-being. A prudent rational agent who must
have freedom and well-being will assert a &ldquo;prudential right
claim&rdquo; (1982: 31)to them. But, having demanded that others must
respect her freedom and well-being, consistency requires her to
recognize and respect the freedom and well-being of all other persons,
too. She &ldquo;logically must accept&rdquo; (1982: 20) that other
people as agents have equal rights to freedom and well-being. These
two abstract rights work alone and together to generate a list of more
determinate human rights of familiar sorts (Gewirth 1978, 1982, 1996).
Gewirth&rsquo;s argument generated a large critical literature (see
Beyleveld 1991 and Boylan 1999).</p>

<p>
A more recent attempt to base human rights on agency and autonomy is
found in James Griffin&rsquo;s book, <em>On Human Rights</em> (2008).
Griffin does not share Gewirth&rsquo;s goal of providing a logically
inescapable argument for human rights, but his overall view shares key
structural features with Gewirth&rsquo;s. These include basing the
justification on the unique value of agency and autonomy, postulating
some abstract rights, and making place for a right to well-being
within an agency-based approach.</p>

<p>
In the current dispute between &ldquo;moral&rdquo; (or
&ldquo;orthodox&rdquo;) and &ldquo;political&rdquo; conceptions of
human rights, Griffin strongly sides with those who see human rights
as fundamentally moral rights (on this debate see Liao &amp; Etinson
2012). Their defining role, in Griffin&rsquo;s view, is protecting
people&rsquo;s ability to form and pursue conceptions of a worthwhile
life&mdash;a capacity that Griffin variously refers to as
&ldquo;autonomy&rdquo;, &ldquo;normative agency&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;personhood&rdquo;. This ability to form, revise, and pursue
conceptions of a worthwhile life is taken to be of paramount value,
the exclusive source of human dignity, and thereby the basis of human
rights. Griffin holds that people value this capacity
&ldquo;especially highly, often more highly than even our
happiness&rdquo; (2008: 32 [&sect;2.3])</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Practicalities&rdquo; also shape human rights in
Griffin&rsquo;s view. He describes practicalities as &ldquo;a second
ground&rdquo; (2008: 37&ndash;39 [&sect;2.5]) of human rights. They
prescribe making the boundaries of rights clear by avoiding &ldquo;too
many complicated bends&rdquo; (2008: 37 [&sect;2.5]), enlarging rights
a little to give them safety margins, and consulting facts about human
nature and the nature of society. Accordingly, the justifying generic
function that Griffin assigns to human rights is protecting normative
agency while taking account of practicalities.</p>

<p>
Griffin thinks that he can explain the universality of human rights by
recognizing that normative agency is a threshold concept&mdash;once
one is above the threshold one has the same rights as everyone else.
One&rsquo;s degree of agency above the threshold does not matter.
There are no &ldquo;degrees of being a person&rdquo; (2008: 67
[&sect;3.5]) among competent adults. Treating agency in this way,
however, is a normative policy, not just a fact about concepts. An
alternative policy is possible, namely proportioning people&rsquo;s
rights to their level of normative agency. This is what we do with
children; their rights grow as they develop greater agency and
responsibility. To exclude proportional rights, and to explain the
egalitarian dimensions of human rights, including their character as
universal and equal rights to be enjoyed without discrimination, some
additional ground pertaining to fairness and equality seems to be
needed.</p>

<p>
This last point raises the question of whether agency-based approaches
in general can adequately account for the universality, equality, and
anti-discriminatory character of human rights. The idea that human
rights are to be respected and protected without discrimination seems
to be most centrally a matter of fairness rather than one of agency,
freedom, or welfare. Discrimination often harms and hinders its
victims, but even when it doesn&rsquo;t it is still deeply unfair. For
example, human rights that explicitly refer to fair wages and equal
pay for equal work (ICESCR Articles 3 and 7.i) seem to be much more
about fairness than about agency, freedom, or
welfare&mdash;particularly since human rights to a wage that ensures a
decent standard of living are often mentioned separately (ICESCR
Article 7.ii).</p>

<h4>2.2.2 Dignity</h4>

<p>
Many human rights declarations and treaties invoke human dignity as
the ground of human rights. In recent decades numerous books and
articles have been published that advocate dignitarian approaches to
justifying human rights (for example, Gilabert 2018b; Kateb 2014;
McCrudden 2013 and the many essays therein; Tasioulas 2015; Waldron
2012 and 2015). There have also been many critics, including Den
Hartogh 2014; Etinson 2020; Green 2010; Macklin 2003; Rosen 2012;
and Sangiovanni 2017.</p>

<p>
A well-worked out conception of human dignity is likely to have at
least three parts. The first describes the nature of human dignity,
specifying for example whether it is a kind of value, status, or
virtue (see Rosen 2012). The second explains the grounds of human
dignity&mdash;that is, why, or in virtue of which shared capacities or
features we all have the sort of dignity described in the first step.
Finally, and third, there is the question of human dignity&rsquo;s
practical requirements, or what is concretely involved in
&ldquo;respecting&rdquo; it. (See the entry on
 <a href="../dignity/">dignity</a>
 for a broader discussion.)</p>

<p>
Human dignity is often understood as a special worth or status which
all human beings share in contrast to other animals (e.g., Kateb
2011). We can call this the &ldquo;Special Worth Thesis&rdquo;.
Attempts to provide good explanatory grounds for the Special Worth
Thesis identify one or more valuable features that all human persons
share and that non-human animals mostly do not possess or have at much
lower levels. The valuable features identified will presumably once
again need to be &ldquo;threshold concepts&rdquo;, so that people can
vary in how much of the feature or capacity they have without thereby
losing, lessening, or increasing their human dignity in comparison to
other persons. Human dignity is, after all, supposed to be a strongly
egalitarian idea. Plausible candidates for such grounds might include
moral abilities (to understand and follow moral values and norms and
to reason and act in terms of them); thought, imagination, and
rationality; self-consciousness and reflective capacities; and the use
of complicated language and technologies, among others.</p>

<p>
One worry about the Special Worth Thesis is its self-glorifying
character. In claiming special worth we humans seem to excuse our many
faults&mdash;including a terrible capacity for evil, routinely
evidenced in our behavior towards other humans and towards non-human
animals (Rosen 2013). Another closely associated and increasingly
prominent worry is that the Special Worth Thesis is speciesist,
arbitrarily ranking the interests, status, and/or value of human
beings above that/those of non-human animals (Kymlicka 2018; Meyer
2001). In the context of these reasonable concerns, it is worth noting
that support for, or a belief in, human dignity need not be
prejudicial towards non-human animals; one can affirm the dignity of
homo sapiens while also affirming the equal dignity of other species
and forms of life (Etinson 2020; Gilabert 2018b). The Special Worth
Thesis is optional and only defended by some theorists.</p>

<p>
What attitudes, actions, policies, and rights follow from the duty or
reason to respect human dignity? And are human rights among them? The
answer will at least in part depend on what we think human dignity is.
If it is a kind of <em>virtue</em> shared or shareable by all persons
then its practical requirements will include things like praising
and/or admiring those who possess it, and perhaps developing or
cultivating &ldquo;dignitarian&rdquo; dispositions in one&rsquo;s own
character. If human dignity is, by contrast, a kind of <em>value or
worth</em> (as in Immanuel Kant&rsquo;s famous understanding of
dignity as a worth &ldquo;beyond all price&rdquo; Kant 1785/1996: 43),
then it is something we have reason to protect, promote, preserve,
cherish, restore and perhaps even maximize, if possible. The human
right to life, and its material conditions, is an intuitive product of
human dignity understood in this way. If, on the other hand, we think
of human dignity as a kind of legal (Waldron 2012 and 2015),
moral (Gilabert 2018b; Lee &amp; George 2008), or social
<em>status</em> (Etinson 2020; Killmister 2020), then duties of
&ldquo;respect&rdquo; more naturally follow.</p>

<p>
These options are not mutually exclusive. In principle, human dignity
can refer to all of these things: value, status, and virtue. If human
dignity yields human rights, however, this is going to depend on
exactly how we understand its practical requirements in light of its
nature and grounds. This practical elaboration is the workhorse of a
conception of human dignity. It normally results in one or more
general maxims or guidelines: e.g., not to humiliate or degrade, never
to treat persons merely as a means, to treat others in justifiable
ways, to avoid severe cruelty, to respect autonomy, etc. The prospect
of grounding human rights in human dignity faces critical challenges
at this juncture. As we saw in the preceding discussion of
agency-based approaches, the more specific and singular one&rsquo;s
dignitarian maxim is, the less plausible it will be as an exhaustive
ground for standard lists of human rights in all their variety. On the
other hand, a pluralistic set of grounding maxims will make human
dignity a better source of human rights, but it is unclear whether in
doing so we are simply explaining its implicit content or bringing in
other values and norms to fill in its indeterminate scope. This raises
the possibility that values and norms such as promoting human welfare;
agency/autonomy; and fairness partially constitute the idea of human
dignity rather than being derived from it (see Macklin 2003).</p>

<h2 id="WhicRighHumaRigh">3. Which Rights are Human Rights?</h2>

<p>
This section discusses the question of which rights belong on lists of
human rights. The Universal Declaration&rsquo;s list, which has been
very influential, consists of six families:</p>

<ol style="list-style: decimal">

<li>Security rights that protect people against murder, torture, and
genocide;</li>

<li>Due process rights that protect people against arbitrary and
excessively harsh punishments and require fair and public trials for
those accused of crimes;</li>

<li>Liberty rights that protect people&rsquo;s fundamental freedoms in
areas such as belief, expression, association, and movement;</li>

<li>Political rights that protect people&rsquo;s liberty to
participate in politics by assembling, protesting, voting, and serving
in public office;</li>

<li>Equality rights that guarantee equal citizenship, equality before
the law, and freedom from discrimination; and</li>

<li>Economic and social rights that require that governments to forbid
slavery and forced labor, enforce safe working conditions, ensure to
all the availability of work, education, health services, and a
standard of living that is adequate.</li>
</ol>

<p>
A seventh category, minority and group rights, has been created by
subsequent treaties. These rights protect women, racial and ethnic
minorities, indigenous peoples, children, migrant workers, and the
disabled. This list of human rights seems normatively diverse: the
issues addressed cover include security, liberty, fairness, equality
before the law, access to work and good working conditions, unduly
cruel treatment, and political participation.</p>

<p>
In spite of the ample list above, not every question of social justice
or wise governance is a human rights issue. For example, a country
could have too many lawyers or inadequate provision for graduate-level
education without violating any human rights. Deciding which norms
should be counted as human rights is a matter of considerable
difficulty. And there is continuing pressure to expand lists of human
rights to include new areas. Many political movements would like to
see their main concerns categorized as matters of human rights, since
this would publicize, promote, and legitimize their concerns at the
international level. A possible result of this is &ldquo;human rights
inflation&rdquo;, the devaluation of human rights caused by producing
too much bad human rights currency (see Cranston 1973; Orend 2002;
Wellman 1995; Griffin 2008).</p>

<p>
One way to avoid rights inflation is to follow Cranston in insisting
that human rights only deal with extremely important goods,
protections, and freedoms. A supplementary approach is to impose
several justificatory tests for specific human rights. For example, it
could be required that a proposed human right not only protect some
very important good but also respond to one or more common and serious
threats to that good (Dershowitz 2004; Donnelly 1989 [2003]; Shue
1996; Talbott 2005), impose burdens on the addressees that are
justifiable and no larger than necessary, and be feasible in most of
the world&rsquo;s countries (on feasibility see Gheaus 2022; Gilabert
2009; Nickel 2007; and Richards 2023). This approach restrains rights
inflation with several tests, not just one master test.</p>

<p>
In deciding which norms should be considered human rights it is
possible to make either too little or too much of international
documents such as the Universal Declaration and the European
Convention. One makes too little of them by proceeding as if drawing
up a list of important rights were a new question, never before
addressed, and as if there were no practical wisdom to be found in the
choices of rights that went into the historic documents. And one makes
too much of them by presuming that those documents tell us everything
we need to know about human rights. This approach involves a kind of
fundamentalism: it holds that when a right is on the official lists of
human rights that settles its status as a human right (&ldquo;If
it&rsquo;s in the book that&rsquo;s all I need to know&rdquo;.) But
the process of identifying human rights in the United Nations and
elsewhere was a political process with plenty of imperfections. There
is little reason to take international diplomats as the most
authoritative guides to which human rights there are. Further, even if
a treaty&rsquo;s ratification by most countries can settle the
question of whether a certain right is a human right within
international law, such a treaty cannot settle its weight. The treaty
may suggest that the right is supported by weighty considerations, but
it cannot make this so. If an international treaty enacted a right to
visit national parks without charge as a human right, the ratification
of that treaty would make free access to national parks a human right
within international law, but it may well fail to persuade us that
national park access is important enough to be a genuine human
right.</p>

<h3 id="CiviPoliRigh">3.1 Civil and Political Rights</h3>

<p>
The least controversial family of human rights is civil and political
rights. These rights are familiar from historic bills of rights such
as the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen (1789)
and the U.S. Bill of Rights (1791, with subsequent amendments).
Contemporary sources include the first 21 Articles of the
 <a href="#UDHR">Universal Declaration</a>,
 and treaties such as the
 <a href="#ECHR">European Convention</a>,
 the
 <a href="#ICCPR">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>,
 the
 <a href="#ACHR">American Convention on Human Rights</a>,
 and the
 <a href="#banjul">African Charter on Human and People&rsquo;s Rights</a>.
 Some representative formulations follow:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Everyone has the right to freedom of thought and expression. This
right includes freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and
ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in
writing, in print, in the form of art, or through any other medium of
one&rsquo;s choice.
 (<a href="#ACHR">American Convention on Human Rights</a>,
 Article 13.1)</p>

<p>
Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom
of association with others, including the right to form and to join
trade unions for the protection of his interests.
 (<a href="#ECHR">European Convention</a>,
 Article 11)</p>

<p>
No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with
his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks
on his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection
of the law against such interference or attacks. (ICCPR Article
17)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Most civil and political rights are not absolute&mdash;they can
sometimes be overridden by other considerations. For example, the
right to freedom of movement can be restricted by public and private
property rights, by restraining orders related to domestic violence,
and by legal punishments. Further, after a disaster such as a
hurricane or earthquake free movement is often appropriately suspended
to keep out the curious, permit access of emergency vehicles and
equipment, and prevent looting. The International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights permits most rights to be suspended during times
&ldquo;of public emergency which threatens the life of the
nation&rdquo; (ICCPR Article 4). But it excludes some rights from
suspension including the right to life, the prohibition of torture,
the prohibition of slavery, the prohibition of <em>ex post facto</em>
criminal laws, and freedom of thought and religion.</p>

<h3 id="EconSociRigh">3.2 Economic and Social Rights</h3>

<p>
The Universal Declaration included economic and social rights
(&ldquo;ESRs&rdquo;) that address matters such as education, food,
health services, and employment. Their inclusion has been the source
of much controversy (see Beetham 1995). The European Convention did
not include them (although it was later amended to include the right
to education). Instead ESRs were put into a separate treaty, the
 <a href="#ESC">European Social Charter</a>.
 When the United Nations began the process of putting the rights of
the Universal Declaration into international law, it followed the same
pattern by placing ESRs in a treaty separate from the one dealing with
civil and political rights. This treaty, the
 <a href="#ICESCR">International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights</a>
 (ICESCR, 1966), treated these standards as rights&mdash;albeit rights
to be progressively realized.</p>

<p>
The ICESCR includes rights to: freedom from slavery and forced labor;
adequate income or services to cover food, water, clothing, and
shelter; basic health conditions and services; free public education;
freedom to work, choose one's occupation, and have adequate
opportunities for remunerative employment; fair pay and safe
conditions of work; social security; equality for women in the
workplace, including equal pay for equal work; freedom to form trade
unions and to strike; special protections for mothers and children;
adequate rest and leisure; and nondiscrimination in respecting,
protecting, and fulfilling these rights. In terms of underlying values
and norms, some of these rights are welfare-oriented, others are
fairness-oriented, and still others are freedom-oriented (Nickel
2022b).</p>

<p>
Article 2.1 of the ICESCR sets out what each of the parties commits
itself to do about this list, namely to</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
take steps, individually and through international assistance and
co-operation&hellip;to the maximum of its available resources, with a
view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights
recognized in the present Covenant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In contrast, the Civil and Political Covenant commits its signatories
to immediate compliance, to</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory the
rights recognized in the present Covenant. (ICCPR Article 2.1)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The contrast between these two levels of commitment has led some
people to suspect that ESRs are really just valuable goals. For many
countries, noncompliance due to inability would have been certain if
these standards had been treated as immediately binding.</p>

<p>
ESRs have often been defended with linkage arguments which claim that
ESRs provide indispensable support to the realization of civil and
political rights. This approach was first developed philosophically by
Henry Shue. He argued that security and subsistence are so
indispensable to the full realization of other rights that anyone who
endorses the realization of any other right must also endorse ESRs
(Shue 1980; for analysis and critical assessments of linkage arguments
see Nickel 2007, 2016, and 2022a).</p>

<p>
Do ESRs protect sufficiently important human interests? Maurice
Cranston opposed ESRs by suggesting that they are mainly concerned
with matters such as holidays with pay which are not of deep and
universal human interest (Cranston 1967, 1973; treatments of
objections to ESRs include Beetham 1995; Howard 1983; and Nickel
2007). It is far from the case, however, that most ESRs pertain only
to superficial interests. Consider two examples: the right to an
adequate standard of living and the right to free public education.
The former requires governments to work hard at remedying widespread
and serious evils such as severe poverty, starvation and malnutrition,
and ignorance. The importance of food and other basic material
conditions of life is easy to show. These goods are essential to
people&rsquo;s ability to live, function, and flourish. Without
adequate access to these goods, interests in life, health, and liberty
are endangered and serious illness and death are probable. The
unavailability of educational opportunities typically limits
(both absolutely and comparatively) people&rsquo;s abilities to
participate fully and effectively in the political and economic life
of their county</p>

<p>
Are ESRs too burdensome? Another objection to ESRs is that they are
too burdensome on their dutybearers. It is very expensive to guarantee
everyone basic education and minimal material conditions. Frequently
the claim that ESRs are too burdensome suggests that ESRs are
substantially more burdensome or expensive than liberty rights.
Suppose, however, that we use as a basis of comparison liberty rights
such as freedom of communication, association, and movement. These
rights require both respect and protection from governments. And
people cannot be adequately protected in their enjoyment of liberties
such as these unless they also have security and due process rights.
The costs of liberty, as it were, include the costs of law and
criminal justice. Once we see this, liberty rights start to look a lot
more costly.</p>

<p>
Further, we need not generally think of ESRs as simply giving everyone
a free supply of the goods they protect. Guarantees of things like
food and housing may be intolerably expensive and undermine
productivity if everyone simply receives a free supply. A viable
system of ESRs can require most people to provide these goods for
themselves and their families through work, as long as they are given
the necessary opportunities, education, and infrastructure.
Government-implemented ESRs provide guarantees of availability (or
&ldquo;secure access&rdquo;), but under many conditions governments
should only have to supply the requisite goods in a small fraction of
cases.</p>

<p>
Countries that do not accept and implement ESRs must still somehow
bear the costs of providing for the needy since these countries are
unlikely to find it tolerable to allow sizable parts of the population
to starve and be homeless. If government does not supply food,
clothing, and shelter to those unable to provide for themselves, then
families, friends, and communities will have to shoulder this burden.
It is only in the last hundred or so years that government-sponsored
ESRs have taken over a substantial part of the burden of providing for
the needy. The taxes associated with ESRs are partial replacements for
other burdensome duties, namely the duties of families and communities
to provide adequate care for the unemployed, sick, disabled, and aged.
Deciding whether to implement ESRs is not a matter of deciding whether
to bear such burdens, but rather of deciding whether to continue with
total reliance on systems of informal provision that distribute
assistance in a very spotty way and whose costs fall very unevenly on
families, friends, and communities.</p>

<p>
Are ESRs feasible worldwide? Another objection to ESRs alleges that
they are not feasible in many countries (on feasibility see Gheaus
2013, Gilabert 2009, and Nickel 2007). It is very expensive to provide
guarantees of subsistence, measures to protect and restore
people&rsquo;s health, and education. Many governments will be unable
to provide these guarantees while meeting other important
responsibilities. Rights are not magical sources of supply (Holmes
&amp; Sunstein 1999). As we saw earlier, the ESR Covenant dealt with
the issue of feasibility by calling for progressive implementation,
that is, implementation as financial and other resources permit. Does
this view of implementation turn ESRs into high-priority goals? And if
so, is that a bad thing?</p>

<p>
Standards that outrun the abilities of many of their addressees are
good candidates for treatment as goals. Viewing them as largely
aspirational rather than as imposing immediate duties avoids problems
of inability-based noncompliance. One may worry, however, that this is
too much of a demotion for ESRs because goals seem much weaker than
rights (see O&rsquo;Neill 2005 and Tomalty 2014). But goals can be
formulated in ways that make them more like rights. They can be
assigned addressees (the parties who are to pursue the goal),
beneficiaries, scopes that define the objective to be pursued, and a
high level of priority (see Langford, Sumner, &amp; Yamin 2013 and
Nickel 2013; see also
 <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/sdgs" target="other">OHCHR and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, UN</a>).
 Strong reasons for the importance of these goals can be provided. And
supervisory bodies can monitor levels of progress and pressure
low-performing addressees to attend to and work on realizing their
goals.</p>

<p>
Treating very demanding rights as goals has some advantages. Goals
coexist easily with low levels of ability to achieve them. And goals
are flexible: addressees with different levels of ability can choose
ways of pursuing the goals that suit their circumstances and means.
Because of these attractions it may be worth exploring sophisticated
ways to transform very demanding human rights into goals. The
transformation may be full or partial. It is possible to create
right-goal mixtures that contain some mandatory elements (see Brems
2009). A right-goal mixture might include some rights-like goals, some
mandatory steps to be taken immediately, and duties to realize the
rights-like goals as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>
Do ESRs yield a sufficient commitment to equality? Objections to ESRs
as human rights have come from both the political right and the
political left. A common objection from the left, including liberal
egalitarians and socialists, is that ESRs as enumerated in human
rights documents and treaties provide too weak of a commitment to
material equality (Gilabert 2018a and Moyn 2018). Realizing ESRs
requires governments to ensure everyone an adequate minimum of
resources in some key areas but does not require strong commitments to
equality of opportunity, redistributive taxation, or wealth ceilings
(see the entries on
 <a href="../equality/">equality</a>,
 <a href="../justice-distributive/">distributive justice</a>, and
 <a href="../feminism-liberal/">liberal feminism</a>).</p>
 
<p>
The egalitarian objection cannot be that human rights documents and
treaties show no concern for people living in poverty and misery. One
of the main purposes of including ESRs in human rights documents and
treaties was to promote serious efforts to combat poverty, lack of
education, and unhealthy living conditions in countries all around the
world (see also Langford, Sumner, &amp; Yamin 2013 on the UN
Millennium Development Goals). The objection also cannot be that human
rights facilitated the hollowing out of systems of welfare rights in
many developed countries that occurred after 1980 (for criticism of
this view see Song 2019). Those cuts in welfare programs were often in
violation of the requirements of realizing ESRs.</p>

<p>
Perhaps it should be conceded that human rights documents and treaties
have not said enough about positive measures to promote equal
opportunity in education and work. A positive right to equal
opportunity, like the one Rawls proposed, would require countries to
take serious measures to reduce disparities between the opportunities
effectively available to children of high-income and low-income
parents (see Rawls 1971 and the entry on
 <a href="../equal-opportunity/">equality of opportunity</a>).</p>
 
<p>
A strongly egalitarian political program is probably best pursued
partially within but mostly beyond the human rights framework. One
reason for this is that the human rights movement will have better
prospects for ongoing acceptance and support if it has widespread
political acceptance. To achieve this, the rights it endorses must
appeal to people with a variety of political views, ranging from
center-left to center-right. Support from the broad political center
is less likely to emerge and survive if the human rights platform is
perceived as mostly a leftist program.</p>

<h3 id="HumaRighWomeMinoGrou">3.3 Human Rights of Women, Minorities, and Groups</h3>

<p>
Equality of rights for historically disadvantaged or subordinated
groups is a longstanding concern of the human rights movement. Human
rights documents repeatedly emphasize that <em>all</em> people,
including women and members of minority ethnic and religious groups,
have equal human rights and should be able to enjoy them without
discrimination. The right to freedom from discrimination figures
prominently in the Universal Declaration and subsequent treaties. The
Civil and Political Covenant, for example, commits participating
states to respect and protect their people&rsquo;s rights without
distinction of any kind, such as race, color, sex, language, political
or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, or
social status (ICCPR Article 2.1). On minority and group rights see
Kymlicka 1995.</p>

<p>
A number of standard civil and political rights are especially
important to ethnic and religious minorities, including rights to
freedom of association, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, and
freedom from discrimination. Human rights documents also include
rights that refer to minorities explicitly and give them special
protections. For example, the Civil and Political Covenant in Article
27 says that persons belonging to ethnic, religious, or linguistic
minorities</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
shall not be denied the right, in community with other members of
their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practice their
own religion, or to use their own language. (ICCPR Article 27)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Feminists have often protested that standard lists of human rights do
not sufficiently take into account the unique risks faced by women.
For example, issues like domestic violence, reproductive choice, and
the trafficking of women and girls for sex work did not have a
prominent place in early human rights documents and treaties. Lists of
human rights have had to be expanded &ldquo;to include the degradation
and violation of women&rdquo; (Bunch 2006; see also Okin 1998).
Violations of women&rsquo;s human rights often occur in the
&ldquo;private&rdquo; sphere, i.e., in the home at the hands of other
family members. This suggests that governments cannot be seen as the
only addressees of human rights and that the right to privacy of home
and family needs qualification to allow police to protect women within
the home.</p>

<p>
The issue of how formulations of human rights should respond to
variations in the sorts of risks and dangers that different people
face is difficult and arises not just in relation to gender but also
in relation to age, race, sexual orientation, profession, political
affiliation, religion, and personal interests. Due process rights, for
example, are much more useful to young people (and particularly young
men) than they are to older people since the latter are far less
likely to run afoul of the criminal law.</p>

<p>
Since 1964 the United Nations has mainly dealt with the rights of
women and minorities through specialized treaties such as the
 <a href="#CEAFRD" target="other">International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination</a>
 (1965); the
 <a href="#CEDAW">Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women</a>
 (1979); the
 <a href="#CRC">Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>
 (1989), and the
 <a href="#CRPD">Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</a>
 (2007). See also the
 <a href="#DRIP" target="other">Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</a>
 (2007). Specialized treaties allow international norms to address
unique problems of particular groups such as assistance and care
during pregnancy and childbearing in the case of women, custody issues
in the case of children, and the loss of historic territories by
indigenous peoples.</p>

<p>
Minority groups are often targets of violence. Human rights norms call
upon governments to refrain from such violence and to provide
protections against it. This work is partly done by the right to life,
which is a standard individual right. It is also done by the right
against genocide which protects <em>groups</em> from attempts to
destroy or decimate them. The Genocide Convention was one of the first
human rights treaties after World War II. The right against genocide
is clearly a group right. It is held by both individuals and groups
and provides protection to groups as groups. It is largely negative in
the sense that it requires governments and other agencies to refrain
from destroying groups; but it also requires that legal and other
protections against genocide be created at the national level.</p>

<p>
As a group right, can the right against genocide be a human right?
More generally, can a <em>group</em> right fit the general idea of
human rights as rights of individual persons proposed earlier? Perhaps
it can if we broaden our conception of who can hold human rights to
include important groups that people form and cherish (see the entry
on
 <a href="../rights-group/">group rights</a>).
 This can be made more palatable, perhaps, by recognizing that the
beneficiaries of the right against genocide are individual humans who
enjoy greater security against attempts to destroy the group to which
they belong (Kymlicka 1989).</p>

<h3 id="NewHumaRigh">3.4 New Human Rights</h3>

<p>
Although contemporary lists of human rights are already long, there
are doubtless norms that should be counted as human rights but are not
generally recognized as such. After all, there are lots of areas in
which people&rsquo;s basic welfare, dignity, and fundamental interests
are threatened by the actions and omissions of individuals and
governments. New technologies create new problems and require us to
rethink old solutions. And new political movements emerge and create
demands for their goals and norms as human rights.</p>

<p>
Prominent recent proposals of new human rights include Kimberley
Brownlee&rsquo;s advocacy of a right against social deprivation that
would address severe unwanted loneliness (Brownlee 2020 and
2022), the proposal of a universal right to internet access that was
endorsed by the UN General Assembly in 2016 (UN Resolution 32/13), and
the similar endorsement in 2022 of a right to a clean, healthy, and
sustainable environment (UN Resolution 76/300; see also the entry on
 <a href="../ethics-environmental/">environmental ethics</a>).</p>
 
<p>
The right to a healthy environment provides a good example of how new
human rights can slowly emerge. After a right of this sort was added
to many national bills of rights, environmental NGOs began to promote
it within international organizations. In 2000 the European
Union&rsquo;s Bill of Rights, the
 <a href="#CFR">Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union</a>,
 included in Article 37 an environmental protection norm:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A high level of environmental protection and the improvement of the
quality of the environment must be integrated into the policies of the
Union and ensured in accordance with the principle of sustainable
development.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In 2012 the UN Human Rights Council created a Special Rapporteur
(independent expert) on the Environment, eventually approved the right
to &ldquo;a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment&rdquo;, and
forwarded it to the General Assembly&mdash;where 80 percent of the
world&rsquo;s countries voted for it (UN Resolution
76/300). Human rights approaches to climate change have also been
developed in recent decades (see Bodansky 2009; Caney 2009; Gardiner
2013; and Vanderheiden 2008).</p>

<p>
Worries about the proliferation of human rights have not disappeared.
Lawyers and international organizations have proposed standards to
limit the introduction of new human rights (for example, Alston 1984
and the UN General Assembly 1986). And human rights treaty-making has
slowed. After the approval of the
 <a href="#rome">Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court</a>
 in 1999, the only human rights treaty approved by the UN is the 2006
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. In 2007 a
declaration (not a treaty) on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was
approved by the General Assembly. Prominent philosophers have also
advocated smaller lists of human rights (see, for example,
Cranston 1967 and 1973; Rawls 1999; and Griffin 2008). Griffin also
opposed squeezing new content into existing human rights&mdash;which
he described as the &ldquo;ballooning&rdquo; of rights.</p>

<h2 id="UnivHumaRighWorlDiveBeliPrac">4. Universal Human Rights in a World of Diverse Beliefs and Practices</h2>

<p>
Two familiar philosophical worries about human rights are that they
are based on beliefs and attitudes that are culturally relative and
that their creation and advocacy involves ethnocentrism. Human rights
prescribe universal standards in areas such as security, law
enforcement, equality, political participation, and education. The
peoples and countries of planet Earth are, however, enormously varied
in their practices, traditions, religions, and levels of economic and
political development. Putting these two propositions together may be
enough to justify the worry that universal human rights do not
sufficiently accommodate the diversity of Earth&rsquo;s peoples. A
theoretical expression of this worry is &ldquo;relativism&rdquo;, the
idea that ethical, political, and legal standards are only true or
justified relative to the traditions, beliefs, and conditions of a
particular country, culture or region (see the entry on
 <a href="../moral-relativism/">moral relativism</a>).</p>
 
<p>
During the drafting in 1947 of the Universal Declaration, the
Executive Board of the American Anthropological Association
(&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) warned of the danger that the Declaration would be
&ldquo;a statement of rights conceived only in terms of the values
prevalent in Western Europe and America&rdquo;. A central concern of
the AAA Board in the period right after World War II was to condemn
intolerant colonialist attitudes of the day and to advocate cultural
and political self-determination. But the Board also made the stronger
assertion that &ldquo;standards and values are relative to the culture
from which they derive&rdquo; and thus &ldquo;what is held to be a
human right in one society may be regarded as anti-social by another
people&rdquo; (AAA 1947).</p>

<p>
Such assertions have continued to fuel accusations that human rights
are instruments of ethnocentrism, arrogance, and cultural imperialism
(Renteln 1990). Ethnocentrism is the assumption, usually unconscious,
that &ldquo;one&rsquo;s own group is the center of everything&rdquo;
and that its beliefs, practices, and norms provide the standards by
which other groups are &ldquo;scaled and rated&rdquo; (Sumner 1906;
see also Etinson 2018a who argues that ethnocentrism is best
understood as a kind of cultural bias rather than a belief in cultural
superiority). Ethnocentrism can lead to arrogance and intolerance in
dealings with other countries, ethical systems, and religions.
Finally, cultural imperialism occurs when the economically,
technologically, and militarily strongest countries impose their
beliefs, values, and institutions on the rest of the world (for a
useful discussion of several power-related concerns about human
rights, see Gilabert 2018a).</p>

<p>
As in the AAA Board&rsquo;s case, relativists often combine these
charges with a prescription, namely that tolerance of varied practices
and traditions ought to be instilled and practiced through measures
that include extended learning about other cultures. The idea that
relativism and exposure to other cultures promote tolerance may be
correct from a psychological perspective. People who are sensitive to
differences in beliefs, practices, and traditions, and who are
suspicious of the grounds for extending norms across borders, may be
more inclined to be tolerant of other countries and peoples than those
who believe in an objective universal morality. Still, philosophers
have been generally critical of attempts to argue from relativism to a
prescription of tolerance (see Williams 1972 [1993] and Talbott 2005).
If the culture and religion of one country has long fostered
intolerant attitudes and practices, and if its citizens and officials
act intolerantly towards people from other countries, they are simply
following their own traditions and cultural norms. Accordingly, a
relativist from a tolerant country will be hard-pressed to find a
basis for criticizing the citizens and officials of the intolerant
country. To do so the relativist will have to endorse a transcultural
principle of tolerance and to advocate as an outsider cultural change
in the direction of greater tolerance. Because of this, relativists
who are deeply committed to tolerance may find themselves attracted to
a qualified commitment to human rights.</p>

<p>
Perhaps for these reasons, relativism is not the stance of most
anthropologists today. Currently the AAA has a central Committee whose
objectives include promoting, protecting, and developing an
anthropological perspective on human rights. While still emphasizing
the importance of cultural differences, anthropologists now often
support the protection of vulnerable cultures, non-discrimination, and
the rights and land claims of indigenous peoples (see the AAA&rsquo;s
2020 Statement on Anthropology and Human Rights).</p>

<p>
The conflict between relativists and human rights advocates may be
partially based on differences in their underlying philosophical
beliefs, particularly in metaethics. Relativists are often
subjectivists or noncognitivists and think of morality as entirely
socially constructed and transmitted. In contrast,
philosophically-inclined human rights advocates are more likely to
adhere to or presuppose cognitivism, moral realism, and
intuitionism.</p>

<p>
As the AAA&rsquo;s 1947 Statement shows, the accommodation of
diversity has been a concern facing the contemporary human rights
regime since its inception. As part of a 1946&ndash;47 UNESCO inquiry
into the theoretical basis of human rights, the French philosopher,
Jacques Maritain, famously suggested that universal agreement on human
rights was possible so long as questions of underlying justification
were ignored: &ldquo;Yes&hellip; we agree about the rights but on
condition no one asks us why&rdquo; (Maritain 1949: 9). The International
Bill of Human Rights appears to violate this embargo when it asserts,
in the Preamble to both major Covenants, that &ldquo;these rights
derive from the inherent dignity of the human person&rdquo;.
Nonetheless, Maritain&rsquo;s idea has strong echoes in contemporary
philosophical work (see Taylor 1999), including John Rawls&rsquo; idea
that human rights can have a minimal public or &ldquo;political&rdquo;
justification which may be accepted from various
&ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo; religious, moral, and philosophical points
of view (Rawls 1999; Beitz 2009). Indeed, some have argued that
international human rights law&rsquo;s justificatory appeal to human
dignity should be understood in precisely this ecumenical way
(McCrudden 2008).</p>

<p>
Other important methods of accommodating diversity include the
abstract formulation of human rights norms, which allows for diverse,
context-sensitive modes of social and institutional implementation
(see Etinson 2013). As discussed in
 <a href="#GeneIdeaHumaRigh">section 1</a>,
 a modest understanding of the aims of human rights would leave more
room for democratic decision-making at the domestic level, and for
cultural and political variation across countries (see also the
European Court of Human Rights&rsquo; notion of a &ldquo;margin of
appreciation&rdquo;, discussed in Letsas 2006). And it is worth noting
that, within limits, state parties to international human rights
treaties are entitled to submit &ldquo;reservations&rdquo; that alter
the legal effect of treaty provisions as they pertain to that state.
This provides a further avenue for legal variation and
accommodation.</p>

<p>
In the 1990s, Singapore&rsquo;s Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and
others argued that international human rights as found in United
Nations declarations and treaties were insensitive to distinctive
&ldquo;Asian values&rdquo;, such as prizing families and community (in
contrast to strong individualism); putting social harmony over
personal freedom; respect for political leaders and institutions; and
emphasizing responsibility, hard work, and thriftiness as means of
social progress (on the Asian Values debate see Bauer &amp; Bell [eds]
1999; Bell 2000; and Sen 1997). Proponents of the Asian values idea
did not wish to abolish all human rights; they rather wanted to
deemphasize some families of human rights, particularly the
fundamental freedoms and rights of democratic participation (and in
some cases the rights of women). They also wanted Western governments
and NGOs to stop criticizing them for human rights violations in these
areas.</p>

<p>
At the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, countries
including Singapore, Malaysia, China, and Iran advocated
accommodations within human rights practice for cultural and economic
differences. Western representatives tended to view the position of
these countries as excuses for repression and authoritarianism. The
Conference responded by approving the
 <a href="#Vienna">Vienna Declaration</a>.
 It included in Article 5 the assertion that countries should not pick
and choose among human rights:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
All human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent and
interrelated. The international community must treat human rights
globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing, and with the
same emphasis. While the significance of national and regional
particularities and various historical, cultural and religious
backgrounds must be borne in mind, it is the duty of States,
regardless of their political, economic and cultural systems, to
promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In recent decades widespread acceptance of human rights has occurred
in most parts of the world. Three quarters of the world&rsquo;s
countries have ratified the major human rights treaties, and many
countries in Africa, the Americas, and Europe participate in regional
human rights regimes that have international courts (see the
Georgetown University Human Rights Law Research Guide in the
 <a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>
 below). Ratification does not, of course, guarantee compliance.
Further, all of the world&rsquo;s countries now use similar political
institutions (law, courts, legislatures, executives, militaries,
bureaucracies, police, prisons, taxation, and public schools) and
these institutions carry with them characteristic problems and abuses
(Donnelly 1989 [2020]). Finally, globalization has diminished the
differences among peoples. Today&rsquo;s world is not the one that
early anthropologists and missionaries found. National and cultural
boundaries are breached not just by international trade but also by
millions of travelers and migrants, electronic communications,
international law covering many areas, and the efforts of
international governmental and non-governmental organizations.
International influences and organizations are everywhere and
countries borrow freely and regularly from each other&rsquo;s
inventions and practices.</p>

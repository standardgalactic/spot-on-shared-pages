<h2 id="SummLambDati">1. <em>Summa Lamberti</em> and its dating</h2>

<p>
Lambert was the author of a comprehensive textbook on logic, the
<em>Logica</em> or <em>Summa Lamberti</em>. The text was first
identified by Carl Prantl in 1867, but it wasn&rsquo;t until 1971 when
an edition of the complete Latin text was produced, by Franco Alessio.
(Alain de Libera edited a portion of the text, on appellation, in
1981). In 1988, Eleonore Stump and Norman Kretzmann translated the
portion of the <em>Summa</em> on the properties of terms, but a
complete English translation of the entire work wasn&rsquo;t available
until the translation of Thomas S. Maloney in 2015. In this entry, all
English quotations are taken from Maloney, and referenced by paragraph
number; nevertheless, it must be noted that both Alessio&rsquo;s Latin
edition and Maloney&rsquo;s translation should be used with care (Read
2017), with the latter cross-checked against the former and the former
cross-checked against the original manuscripts, many of which are now
available online, in cases of any unclarity or confusion in the
content.</p>

<p>
The <em>Summa</em> survives in at least 15 manuscripts (Maloney 2015:
xv), one of which, (Padua, <em>Biblioteca Universitaria</em> Cod. 647,
dating to the 14th century) contains a colophon informing the reader
that the text was written by one <em>Lambert</em>, who produced it
while he was the teacher of the king of Navarra, and edited it while
working in Paris (de Rijk 1969: 160&ndash;161). From this, de Rijk
concludes that the likely student-king was Theobald II, who was born
in 1240, succeeded his father in 1253, and crowned in 1257, and
derives a date of composition of the <em>Summa</em> of between 1253
and 1257. The work was most likely composed originally in either
Troyes or Pamplona, and then published in Paris after being edited,
most likely around 1260 (de Rijk 1969: 161). Alessio argues, from the
same evidence, for a composition date between 1247 and 1256, on the
assumption Lambert began teaching Theobald before the death of his
father (Maloney 2015: xix). On such a dating, the <em>Summa</em> is
either contemporaneous to or slightly earlier than Peter of
Spain&rsquo;s <em>Summary of Logic</em> and William of
Sherwood&rsquo;s <em>Introduction to Logic</em> (Alessio 1971: xxxi).
De Libera agrees with both the &ldquo;king of Navarra&rdquo;
referenced in the colophon was Theobald II, and argues for a
composition date between 1250 and 1255, in Pamplona (de Libera 1981;
Maloney 2015: xx). Brumberg-Chaumont gives c.1250 as the composition
date (2013: fn.10), while Lagerlund says that the date has been
established as &ldquo;1250&ndash;1260&rdquo;, placing it contemporary
with or shortly after Roger Bacon&rsquo;s <em>Summulae,</em> which is
dated to 1250&ndash;55 (Lagerlund 2000: 21). While a more precise date
than these ranges is unlikely to be given, the evidence is sufficient
to reject the dating of earlier historians who placed the text c.1240,
such a dating is now currently deprecated (Ashworth 2002: 313).</p>

<p>
According to de Rijk, the <em>Summa</em> consists of eleven chapters:
(1) Introduction; (2) Predicables; (3) Syllogistic argumentation; (4)
Dialectical topics; (5) Sophistical topics; (6) Supposition; (7)
Appellation; (8) Restriction; (9) Ampliation; (10) Distribution; and
(11) Relation. He notes that some of the later manuscripts also
contain a chapter on Predicaments, but that </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
this is certainly an interpolation consisting of the text of Peter of
Spain&rsquo;s tract of the same title together with interspersed
comments. (1969: 160) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Maloney&rsquo;s translation, following Alessio&rsquo;s edition
(Maloney 2015: xlvii), consists of eight chapters: (1) Propositions;
(2) Predicables; (3) Categories; (4) Remarks After the Categories; (5)
Syllogism; (6) Topics; (7) Sophistical Topics; and (8) Properties of
Terms, with chapter 8 containing the material of chapters (6&ndash;11)
of de Rijk&rsquo;s list. This final section was translated into
English by Norman Kretzmann and Eleonore Stump in 1988.</p>

<p>
The content of the <em>Summa</em> as expressed by these chapter topics
exemplifies the core aspects of the new developments in logic in the
middle of thirteenth century, what is known as &ldquo;terminist
logic&rdquo; because of its emphasis on terms and their properties,
and how these two things combine into propositions and thence into
syllogisms, or arguments more generally. The text is comparable to the
other summary treatises written by Lambert&rsquo;s rough
contemporaries, William of Sherwood, Roger Bacon, and Peter of Spain
(Maloney 2015: xliii): Together, these four authors and their
textbooks represent the first relatively complete articulations of the
terminist developments of the so-called <em>logica modernorum</em>
(that is the &ldquo;logic of the moderns&rdquo;, to be contrasted with
the older logic based in Aristotle, the <em>logica vetus</em> (Kann
2016: 220). Each of these four treatises provides a slightly different
viewpoint on what was, at the time, still a developing theoretical
discipline. Peter of Spain&rsquo;s book went on to become one of the
most reprinted textbooks before modern times, and Bacon&rsquo;s work
had significant influence on later philosophers, not just logicians.
Sherwood&rsquo;s text seems to have been one of Lambert&rsquo;s
sources (Kretzmann 1966: 4). While Sherwood&rsquo;s treatise is often
the preferable of the four because of its clarity and concision,
Lambert&rsquo;s lengthier treatise is a result of the fact that he
&ldquo;seems to be at pains to give a slightly fuller explanation than
the others&rdquo; (Maloney 2015: xliii) without necessarily falling
into the level of pedantry that Peter&rsquo;s treatise sometimes
embraces.</p>

<p>
No other works, logical or otherwise, by this author have been
identified.</p>

<h2 id="NameIden">2. Name and identification</h2>

<p>
The identity of the author of the text <em>Summa Lamberti</em> is
uncertain, beyond that he was named Lambert (this attribution occurs
in at least four of the manuscripts, and was repeated by later
chroniclers and historians, Maloney 2015: xvi). Three of the
manuscripts differ on the further differentiation they give (de Libera
1981: 229):</p>

<ul>

<li>In MS Troyes 2402, f. 88v, he is called <em>magistri Lamberti di
Liniaco castro,</em> &ldquo;Master Lambert of
Ligny-le-Ch&acirc;tel&rdquo;.</li>

<li>In MS Cambridge 210, f. 47rb, he is called <em>magistri Lamberti
fratris de Sancto Victore sive Sancti Victoris</em>, &ldquo;Master
Lambert, brother of Saint-Victor&rdquo;.</li>

<li>In MS Padova 647, f. 131v, he is called <em>fratre de ordine
Predicatorum qui vocatus fuerat Lambertus</em>, &ldquo;a brother of
the Order of the Preachers, who was called Lambert&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Medieval historians from the fifteenth century onwards identified the
author as a canon of Auxerre, and a member of the Dominican order
(Maloney 2015: xvii; Pignon 1936: 31); Alessio in his edition of the
<em>Summa</em> identified the brother of Auxerre with the Lambert from
Ligny (Maloney 2015: xvi). Assuming this identification is correct,
there are two competing biographies of Lambert that have been
offered:</p>

<ol>

<li> Lambert of Auxerre: Born in Ligny-le-Ch&acirc;tel, and educated
in Paris, this Lambert was a master of arts and a canon at the
cathedral school in Auxerre. When a Dominican chapter was founded in
Auxerre in 1241, Lambert joined. He taught Dominicans novices during
the period 1247 to 1256, in addition to teaching the soon-to-be king
of Navarre, and drafted the <em>Summa</em> then, for those novices.
Afterwards, he revised and edited the book in Paris, and it entered
circulation amongst wider Dominican teaching. He was buried in the
Dominican convent of St. James in Paris (Maloney 2015: xvi).</li>

<li> Lambert of Lagny: Born in Lagny, and a secular clerk in Meaux,
this Lambert taught Theobald II between 1250 and 1255 in Pamplona, and
composed the <em>Summa</em> then. He then edited the text and
circulated between 1263 and 1265, when he was in Paris administering
Theobald&rsquo;s holdings. It was only after this that he became a
Dominican (Maloney 2015: xx&ndash;xxi).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Tracing the evidence for each of these biographies, and variations in
the dates ascribed for each, and mapping how this evidence matches on
to what we know, or surmise, of the author of the
<em>Summa&rsquo;s</em> life, is enormously complex and it is not a
question that can be settled here; the most comprehensive summary of
the evidence and arguments to date can be found in Maloney (2015:
xvi&ndash;xl). Nevertheless, we are left with the question of what to
call the author, and this question is complicated by how he has been
treated in secondary literature in recent decades. The tendency has
been for earlier attributions to call him &ldquo;of Auxerre&rdquo;
(following Alessio) and later ones &ldquo;of Lagny&rdquo; (following
de Libera), but the compass has to some extent swung back to &ldquo;of
Auxerre&rdquo; in the last decade. Kretzmann and Stump when
translating the treatise on the &ldquo;Properties of Terms&rdquo;
subscribe to the view that Lambert was a member of the Dominican house
in Auxerre (in Lambert 1988: 102). Ashworth in her early work calls
him &ldquo;of Auxerre&rdquo; (Ashworth 1991), but later thinks
he&rsquo;s of Lagny (Ashworth 2002, 2007). Cesalli calls him &ldquo;of
Lagny&rdquo; (2013), as does Mur&egrave; (2013), and Fitzgerald refers
to &ldquo;the thirteenth century <em>Summulist</em> &hellip; Lambert
of Lagny&rdquo; (2016: 368). In the &ldquo;of Auxerre&rdquo; camp we
have Lagerlund (2000: fn. 15), Mendelsohn (2017), and Read (2017), and
splitting the difference is Crimi, who refers to him as &ldquo;Lambert
of Lagny (formerly identified as Lambert of Auxerre)&rdquo; (2014: fn.
57), but his source for this was Uckelman (2013), who was simply
relying, uncritically, on de Libera (1981). Many scholars simply avoid
the question: Ebbesen calls him &ldquo;Lambert of Lagny, Ligny or
Auxerre&rdquo; (Ebbesen 2013: 65), while Dutilh Novaes calls him
&ldquo;Lambert of Auxerre/Lagny&rdquo; (Dutilh Novaes 2008: fn. 12,
pp. 237, 246) and Kann conflates the two: &ldquo;Lambert of Lagny
&ndash; otherwise known as Lambert d&rsquo;Auxerre&rdquo; (Kann 2016:
223). In the introduction to his translation, Maloney notes that while
he had earlier concluded that &ldquo;there is insufficient reliable
historical data to identify the author of the <em>Summa Lamberti</em>
as a Dominican of Auxerre in the 1240s&rdquo; (Maloney 2009: 106)
leading him to favor the Lagny Lambert, &ldquo;I now think it
considerably more probable that the author of the <em>Summa
Lamberti</em> was Lambert of Ligny-le-Ch&acirc;tel than Lambert of
Lagny&rdquo; (2015: xxxix), that is, Lambert of Auxerre.</p>

<p>
There simply is no consensus at this point, and unless new evidence
emerges, there is unlikely to be consensus in the future. As a result,
in the remainder of this article we will refer to the author as
&ldquo;Lambert&rdquo;, rather than &ldquo;Auxerre&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Lagny&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Ligny&rdquo;, in order to avoid having
to take a stand.</p>

<h2 id="CompContView">3. Comparison with contemporary views</h2>

<h3 id="SuppAppe">3.1 Supposition and Appellation</h3>

<p>
Lambert&rsquo;s theory of supposition is perhaps one of the most
interesting and distinctive parts of his work, representing the
importance of the new terministic developments in his treatise.</p>

<p>
There are four different ways that the term &ldquo;supposition&rdquo;
can be used (Logica/Maloney &para;1239; cf. Braakhuis 1977;
134&ndash;136; Mendelsohn 2017: 113):</p>

<ol>

<li>&ldquo;the substantive designation or signification of a
thing.&rdquo;</li>

<li>&ldquo;the acceptance of a proposition as true and proven, as it
is often found in disputations.&rdquo;</li>

<li>&ldquo;the locational arrangement of a part of an expression in
the role of something of which something else is said, as supposition
is said to be in a name with respect to a verb, for a name supposits
relative to a verb and a verb is said of a name.&rdquo;</li>

<li>&ldquo;the acceptance of a term for itself or for its [signified]
thing, or for some suppositum [logically] contained under its
[signified] thing, or for more than one suppositum contained under its
[signified] thing.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>

<p>
According to Lambert, from a logical point of view, it is the fourth
way of using the term that matters, because this is the only way that
&ldquo;supposition&rdquo; is a logical property of terms, whereas the
second way doesn&rsquo;t concern him because it is a property of a
proposition rather than of a term. Similarly, the first is not an
instance of a property of a term, but rather &ldquo;a special kind of
signification of a term&rdquo;; in this, Lambert is firmly within the
Parisian, as opposed to Oxonian, tradition of supposition theory
(Marmo 1989: 172; cf. also Kann 2016: 241). The third can be a
property of a term or of a larger phrase in an expression, but Lambert
says this use of &ldquo;supposition&rdquo; is of interest to the
grammarian rather than the logician (&para;1240).</p>

<p>
However, a parenthetical note that he adds to the third way is
noteworthy </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
(Appellation corresponds to this kind of supposition, and appellation
can be said to be the locational arrangement of that which is said of
something else). (&para;1239) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When Lambert discusses appellation later on in the same chapter
(&para;&para;1267ff), his account is more nuanced, identifying again
four ways in which &ldquo;appellation&rdquo; can be used
(&para;1269&ndash;1272):</p>

<ol>

<li>&ldquo;proper naming or the proper name of any person.&rdquo;</li>

<li>&ldquo;the assertion of a common nature containing more than one
suppositum under it.&rdquo;</li>

<li>&ldquo;the acceptance of a term for a suppositum or supposita
contained under its signified thing whether or not those supposita are
existing things. And &lsquo;appellation&rsquo; taken in this way
belongs to terms having supposita under them actually or potentially,
and also to names of imaginary things.&rdquo;</li>

<li>&ldquo;the acceptance of a term for a suppositum or supposita
existing actually.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>

<p>
Again, it is the fourth way which expresses the proper, logical sense
of the term (&para;1272).</p>

<p>
What Lambert says reflects developments in the thirteenth century
whereby &ldquo;appellation&rdquo;, originally a term of grammatical
origin and used in a quite wide and flexible way, including in some
earlier authors as a synonym for &ldquo;supposition&rdquo;, came to
have a narrower, more technical definition in logical contexts
(Braakhuis 1977: 120; Ebbesen 2013: 66&ndash;67).</p>

<p>
Lambert, in keeping with other terminist discussions of supposition,
notes that supposition is posterior to signification; a significative
term can signify in isolation from any other term, but it is only in
the context of a phrase or a sentence that a term can have
supposition. He provides a classification of supposition into the
following types (&para;&para;1249&ndash;1266):</p>

<div class="figure" id="fig1">
<img alt="Lambert's division of supposition: link to extended description below" src="lambert-suppositiontree.svg" style="width:500px" />

<p>
Figure: [An
 <a href="figdesc.html#fig1">extended description of the figure</a>
 is in the supplement.]</p>
</div>

<p>
A detailed discussion of the definitions and applications of these
divisions can be found in Uckelman 2013. Here, we focus on the ways in
which Lambert&rsquo;s supposition theory shows interesting divergences
and connections with other thirteenth century authors.</p>

<p>
One of these ways is how he deals with natural supposition (cf. de
Rijk 1971), which he defines as</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
what a term has of its own and from its nature. A term is said to have
this when it is uttered by itself, that is, when it is adjoined to no
other. (Logica/Maloney &para;1250)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This makes natural supposition at odds with other types of
supposition, which words cannot have in isolation, but only in
combination with other words. Braakhuis explains this via
Lambert&rsquo;s distinction between the first and fourth ways in which
&ldquo;supposition&rdquo; can be used; because Lambert can distinguish
between supposition as a kind of signification and supposition as a
property of a term, he is able to identify a property which
corresponds to the signification of the term, and this property is
natural supposition (Braakhuis 1977: 136; cf. also Brumberg-Chaumont
2013: fn. 72). A similar approach to natural supposition is taken by
Peter of Spain (de Rijk 1971: 97) John Page, and Cesalli argues that
their views underpin some of the rules concerning appellation that
later medieval authors, such as Richard Brinkley, offer (Cesalli 2013:
285).</p>

<p>
A second distinctive feature of his theory is his approach to discrete
supposition, which, as we can see from the tree above, is a type of
personal supposition for Lambert. The ways that contemporary authors
handled discrete supposition can be categorized into four categories:
(1) not mentioning it, (2) mentioning it but ultimately excluding it
(a position held by Peter of Spain), (3) making discrete supposition a
genuine mode of supposition in its own right, distinct from common
supposition and falling under personal supposition, and (4) allowing
that discrete terms have either simple or personal supposition
depending on how they are used (Brumberg-Chaumont 2013: 173&ndash;174;
Brumberg-Chaumont describes this last position as &ldquo;rare&rdquo;,
but attributes it to both William of Sherwood and William Arnaud, a
commentator on Peter of Spain.) Lambert&rsquo;s definition of discrete
supposition, as a form of personal supposition, is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Discrete supposition is what a term has in itself, as in
&lsquo;Socrates runs,&rsquo; or in something equivalent, e.g.,
&ldquo;when a common term is taken with a demonstrative pronoun, as in
&lsquo;This man runs&rdquo;. (&para;1257)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, Lambert falls under the third category (in fact, he actually
thinks discrete supposition is both accidental <em>and</em> personal,
(Brumberg-Chaumont 2013: fn. 10)), a category which Brumberg-Chaumont
characterizes as &ldquo;incoherent and inconsistent&rdquo; (2013:
174).</p>

<h3 id="Rest">3.2 Restriction</h3>

<p>
The range of the supposition of a term can be modified in two ways: It
can be ampliated (stand for more than it would ordinarily have stood
for) or restricted (stand for less than it would ordinarily have stood
for). While both of these notions are common amongst the Terminist
logicians, Lambert&rsquo;s approach to restriction diverges from some
of his contemporaries.</p>

<p>
Lambert identifies two types of restriction: <em>natural</em>
(<em>naturalis</em>) restriction and <em>use-based</em> or
<em>use-governed</em> (<em>usualis</em>) restriction (Uckelman 2013:
493; de Rijk 1971: 100&ndash;101). Natural restriction occurs </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
by means of something added to the restricted term, because the term
is restricted in accord with the nature of what is added to it;
(Logica/Maloney &para;1349) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
an example of natural restriction is when we restrict the term
&ldquo;cat&rdquo;, which would ordinarily stand for all (presently
living) cats, with the term &ldquo;calico&rdquo;, so that its
supposition is now restricted to only calico cats. Use-based
restriction arises not from any other term added to the sentence, but
from the context of use, such as </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
when one says &ldquo;The king is coming&rdquo;: the term
&ldquo;king&rdquo; is restricted to suppositing for the king of the
country in which the sentence is uttered. (&para;1349) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This second, use-based, type, is not found in either William of
Sherwood (Kretzmann 1966: 123&ndash;127) or Peter of Spain (Copenhaver
2014: ch. 11; Kann 2016: 233).</p>

<h3 id="Moda">3.3 Modality</h3>

<p>
Lambert, in common with his contemporaries such as Robert Kilwardby,
Albert the Great, and Roger Bacon (Lagerlund 2000: 23), considers only
the six basic alethic modalities: truth, falsity, necessity,
impossibility, possibility, and contingency (Logica/Maloney
&para;176). He sometimes treats possibility and contingency as
equivalent (&para;194), but sometimes distinguishes between the two
(&para;&para;231&ndash;235), in particular when he discusses
contingency <em>ad utrumlibet</em>, that is contingency which is both
not necessary and not impossible (Lagerlund 2000: 24; Logica/Maloney
&para;234).</p>

<p>
For the most part, what Lambert has to say about modality is quite
basic, and does not extend significantly beyond the traditional
Aristotelian topics of conversion of modal principles. As a result,
Lagerlund argues that &ldquo;it is difficult to say anything about
their [Lambert and Roger Bacon&rsquo;s] systematic relation to
Kilwardby&rdquo;, in contradistinction to de Libera who thinks that
Kilwardby&rsquo;s influence on both authors is clear (Lagerlund 2000:
21). One interesting exception, where Lambert&rsquo;s discussion goes
into more depth than some of his contemporaries, is in the conversion
rules for contingent propositions, particular in the discussion of how
to convert negative contingent propositions when the contingency is
taken as <em>ad utrumlibet</em> (Lagerlund 2000: 44; Logica/Maloney
&para;&para;258&ndash;274).</p>

<h3 id="Rela">3.4 Relations</h3>

<p>
Relations make up the final topic of the final chapter of the
<em>Summa</em>. The word &lsquo;relation&rsquo; is used as a label of
many different things, Lambert says, the first of which is &ldquo;a
reciprocal connection of certain things that have a mutual dependence
on one another&rdquo; (Logica/Maloney &para;1393). This reciprocal
connection can be of one of three kinds: superiority, subordination,
or quality (&para;1394) and in this sense it is one of
Aristotle&rsquo;s predicaments (&para;1393). This is not the primary
sense of relation that Lambert focuses on; instead, he is interested
in the use of &lsquo;relation&rsquo; or &lsquo;relative&rsquo; in
which it is &ldquo;said to be a calling to mind of a thing that has
gone before&rdquo; (&para;1395); this is done via particular
vocabulary or syntactic constructions, and hence this type of relation
is the one that is a proper subject of study for the logician.
Lambert&rsquo;s definition of relation mirrors Peter of Spain&rsquo;s
(Kneepkens 1977: fn. 10), as Peter also distinguishes between
relatives &ldquo;whose being it is to be disposed in some manner to
something else&rdquo;, that is, the Aristotelian predicament, and
relatives which are &ldquo;recollective of a thing brought in before
it&rdquo; (Copenhaver 2015: ch. 8, &para;1; cf. also Kann 2016:
235&ndash;236).</p>

<h2 id="InflFutuView">4. Influence on future views</h2>

<p>
Determining Lambert&rsquo;s influence on future work is contingent
upon determining the precise date of his treatise, so to some extent
these questions will remain only partially answered. Nevertheless,
while there is uncertainty about, e.g., whether Thomas Aquinas knew of
Lambert&rsquo;s work (Goris 2002: 307), we do know that
Lambert&rsquo;s <em>Summa</em> was widely known by the end of the
thirteenth century (Lagerlund 2000: fn. 15). One manuscript copy of
the <em>Summa</em> from 1280 (MS M&eacute;diath&egrave;que du Grand
Troyes, 2402) was donated by Peter of Limoges (d. 1306) on his death
to the Sorbonne (Read 2017: 363), and it was used as a textbook at the
Sorbonne until at least 1334 (Maloney 2015: xliii). </p>

<p>
Sinkler argues that Lambert&rsquo;s discussion of composition and
division influenced Roger Bacon&rsquo;s discussion of the same, in his
<em>Summule dialectices</em>, with the latter being &ldquo;his attempt
to improve on Lambert&rsquo;s account of the nature of the
compounded/divided ambiguity in more detail&rdquo; (Sinkler 1985:
146). Likewise Grabmann has identified an anonymous late-thirteenth
century text in which he sees the influence of not only Lambert but
also William of Sherwood and Peter of Spain (Grabmann 1916:
40&ndash;41). Marmo identifies Lambert&rsquo;s &ldquo;enlarged notion
of <em>suppositio</em>&rdquo; within Duns Scotus&rsquo;s <em>Ars
Vetus</em>, without going as far as to say that Lambert was the source
for Scotus&rsquo;s views on this matter (Marmo 1989: 172), and Buckner
and Zupko have provided substantial indirect evidence that Duns Scotus
was quite familiar with Lambert&rsquo;s work (Bucker &amp; Zupko
2014).</p>

<p>
On the other hand, there appears to be no influence, in either
direction, between Lambert&rsquo;s work and Peter of Spain&rsquo;s
<em>Summary of Logic</em> (Maloney 2015: xvi&ndash;xvii; Copenhaver in
the introduction to his translation of the <em>Summary</em> mentions
Lambert only once, 2014: 13; cf. also de Rijk 1971: 72). Alessio
concludes that both of these texts instead rely &ldquo;on an (unnamed)
common [Parisian] source&rdquo; (Maloney 2015: xvii), and Braakhuis
notes that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
According to him [Maier&ugrave;], the position of Peter of Spain and
Lambert of Auxerre is to be regarded as a combination arising from on
one side the view of the <em>Dialectica Monacensis</em>, the
<em>Tractatus de proprietatibus sermonum</em> and the <em>Summe
Metenses</em> (and William of Sherwood) &hellip; In my opinion
therefore, there is not so much difference between Peter and Lambert
and the <em>Dialectica Monacensis</em> etc. (Braakhuis 1977: 120)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These twelfth-century and earlier thirteenth-century sources may be
responsible for those places where Lambert&rsquo;s and Peter&rsquo;s
views coincide, such as their definitions of &ldquo;relation&rdquo;
(cf. above) and their views about ampliation (Lagerlund 2000: fn.
90).</p>

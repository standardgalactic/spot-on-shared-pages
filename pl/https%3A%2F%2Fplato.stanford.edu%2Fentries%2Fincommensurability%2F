<div id="preamble">

<p>
The term &lsquo;incommensurable&rsquo; means &lsquo;to have no common
measure&rsquo;. The idea traces back to Euclid&rsquo;s
<em>Elements</em>, where it was applied to magnitudes. For example,
there is no common measure between the sides and the diagonal of a
square. Today, such incommensurable relations are represented by
irrational numbers. The metaphorical application of the mathematical
notion specifically to the relation between successive scientific
theories became controversial in 1962 after it was popularised by two
influential philosophers of science: Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend.
They appeared to be challenging the rationality of science and so were
often considered to be among &ldquo;the worst enemies of
science&rdquo; (Theocharis and Psimopoulos 1987, 596; cf. Preston
<em>et al</em>. 2000). Since 1962, the incommensurability of
scientific theories has been a widely discussed, controversial idea
that was instrumental in the historical turn in the philosophy of
science and the establishment of the sociology of science as a
professional discipline.</p>

<h2 id="Intr">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
In the influential <em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em>
(1962), Kuhn made the dramatic claim that history of science reveals
proponents of competing paradigms failing to make complete contact
with each other&rsquo;s views, so that they are always talking at
least slightly at cross-purposes. Kuhn characterized the collective
reasons for these limits to communication as the incommensurability of
pre- and post-revolutionary scientific traditions, claiming that the
Newtonian paradigm is incommensurable with its Cartesian and
Aristotelian predecessors in the history of physics, just as
Lavoisier&rsquo;s paradigm is incommensurable with that of
Priestley&rsquo;s in chemistry (Kuhn 1962, 147&ndash;150; cf.
Caama&ntilde;o 2009 and Hoyningen-Huene 2008). These competing
paradigms lack a common measure because they use different concepts
and methods to address different problems, limiting communication
across the revolutionary divide. Kuhn initially used
incommensurability predominately to challenge <em>cumulative</em>
characterizations of scientific advance, according to which scientific
progress is an improving approximation to the truth, and to challenge
the idea that there are unchanging, neutral methodological standards
for comparing theories throughout the development of the natural
sciences. Like in evolution, the process does not change
<em>toward</em> some fixed goal according to some fixed rules, methods
or standards, but rather it changes <em>away</em> from the pressures
exerted by anomalies on the reigning theory (Kuhn 1962,
170&ndash;173). The process of scientific change is eliminative and
permissive rather than instructive. In the process of confronting
anomalies, certain alternatives are excluded, but nature does not
guide us to some uniquely correct theory.</p>

<p>
Kuhn developed and refined his initial idea over the following
decades, repeatedly emphasizing that incommensurability neither means
nor implies incomparability; nor does it make science irrational (e.g.
Kuhn 2000 [1970], 155ff.). He focused increasingly on conceptual
incompatibility as manifest in the structural differences used to
classify the kinds whose relations are stated in laws and theories,
such as chemical elements and biological species (Kuhn 2000, see
especially chs. 3, 4, 5, 10 &amp; 11). He used incommensurability to
attack the idea, prominent among logical positivists and logical
empiricists, that comparing theories requires translating their
consequences into a neutral observation language (cf. Hoyningen-Huene
1993, 213&ndash;214). In the late 1990s, he explicated
incommensurability in terms of <em>ineffability</em>, emphasizing that
it became possible for scientists to make and understand certain new
statements <em>only after</em> a particular theory had been introduced
(in the older vocabulary the new sentences are nonsensical), just as
it only becomes possible for historians to understand certain older
statements by setting aside current conceptions that otherwise cause
distortions (Kuhn 2000 [1989], 58&ndash;59; 2000 [1993], 244). Such
&lsquo;<em>taxonomic incommensurability</em>&rsquo; results in
translation failure between local subsets of inter-defined terms due
to the cross-classification of objects into mutually exclusive
taxonomies. This can be distinguished from &lsquo;<em>methodological
incommensurability</em>&rsquo;, according to which there is no common
measure between successive scientific theories, in the sense that
theory comparison is sometimes a matter of weighing historically
developing values, not following fixed, definitive rules (Sankey and
Hoyningen-Huene 2001, vii-xv). This makes rational disagreement about
theory comparison possible, as scientists may apply different values
(such as scope, simplicity, fruitfulness, accuracy) in evaluating and
comparing particular theories, so that theory choice is not
unequivocally determined throughout the scientific community.</p>

<p>
Paul Feyerabend initially used the term &lsquo;incommensurable&rsquo;
in &ldquo;Explanation, Reduction and Empiricism&rdquo; (1962). By
calling two rival theories incommensurable, Feyerabend meant that they
are &lsquo;deductively disjoint&rsquo; due to meaning variance in the
concepts used to state them. For example, Feyerabend claimed that the
concepts represented by &lsquo;temperature&rsquo; and
&lsquo;entropy&rsquo; in kinetic theory are incommensurable with those
of phenomenological thermodynamics (1962, 78); and the Newtonian
concepts represented by &lsquo;mass&rsquo;, &lsquo;length&rsquo; and
&lsquo;time&rsquo; are incommensurable with their relativistic
counterparts (1962, 80). By calling two rival theories deductively
disjoint (or &lsquo;incommensurable&rsquo;), Feyerabend meant that one
cannot be deduced from the other, nor can any predictions deduced from
one enter formal logical relations with any predictions deduced from
the other. Because the rival theories give different meanings to the
same observation sentences when they are used to corroborate them by
being deduced from them, the new theory cannot <em>explain</em>
(formally by deduction) the successful predictions deduced from the
established theory, and successful predictions deduced from one cannot
logically contradict unsuccessful predictions deduced from the other
potentially falsifying it (1962, 94, fn. 115).</p>

<p>
Feyerabend developed a model to illustrate how there can be crucial
experiments between incommensurable rivals despite the impossibility
of establishing formal relations between them and any of their
corresponding predictions. He illustrated his test-model with an
example borrowed from David Bohm: the corroboration of the kinetic
theory (atomism) by the confirmation of Einstein&rsquo;s predictions
of the stochastic character of Brownian motion (Oberheim 2024).
Feyerabend repeatedly used the idea of incommensurability and this
test-model to challenge a wide range of forms of conceptual
conservatism for unjustifiably favoring entrenched views over
potential improvements, and to support his methodological argument for
theoretical pluralism as it became the lynchpin of his normative
philosophy from <em>ERE</em> (1962) through <em>Against Method</em>
(1993). Incommensurable alternatives to well-established views should
always be welcome because they may be necessary for showing those
views should be replaced.</p>

<p>
The entry is organized around the 1962 popularizations of the concept
of incommensurability by Kuhn and Feyerabend and the basic ideas that
influenced their developments of this concept. First, Kuhn&rsquo;s
notion of incommensurability as it was initially developed is
characterized, as is its cause and its purported consequences. That is
followed by an examination of Kuhn&rsquo;s route to the idea, and then
his subsequent development after 1962. The sections on
Feyerabend&rsquo;s notion of incommensurability mirror the same basic
structure. They are followed by a brief comparison of Kuhn and
Feyerabend&rsquo;s views on incommensurability, especially its
relation to theory comparison.</p>

<h2 id="RevoParaThomKuhnInco">2. Revolutionary paradigms: Thomas Kuhn on incommensurability</h2>

<p>
Kuhn&rsquo;s notion of incommensurability in <em>The Structure of
Scientific Revolutions</em> misleadingly appeared to imply that
science was somehow irrational, and consequently, it faced many
challenges and caused much confusion. This led to many clarifications,
and eventually to a substantial redevelopment of a more precise and
restricted version of it over the following decades. Kuhn initially
used the term holistically to capture methodological, observational,
and conceptual disparities between successive scientific paradigms
that he had encountered in his historical investigations into the
development of the natural sciences (Kuhn 1962, 148&ndash;150). Later,
he refined the idea arguing that incommensurability is due to
differences in the taxonomic structures of successive scientific
theories and neighboring contemporaneous sub-disciplines. Kuhn&rsquo;s
developing notion of incommensurability has received much attention,
and it continues to provoke plenty of controversy (cf. Bird 2007,
Demir 2008, Moreno 2009, Psillos 2008, and Soler, Sankey and
Hoyningen-Huene 2008).</p>

<h3 id="StruScieRevo">2.1 <em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em></h3>

<p>
In <em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em> (1962), Thomas
Kuhn used the term &lsquo;incommensurable&rsquo; to characterize the
holistic nature of the changes that take place in a scientific
revolution. His investigations into the history of science revealed a
phenomenon often now called &lsquo;Kuhn loss&rsquo;: Problems whose
solution was vitally important to the older tradition may temporarily
disappear, become obsolete, or even unscientific. On the other hand,
problems that had not even existed, or whose solution had been
considered trivial, may gain extraordinary significance in the new
tradition. Kuhn concluded that proponents of incommensurable theories
have different conceptions of their discipline and different views
about what counts as good science; and that these differences arise
because of changes in the list of problems that a theory must resolve
and a corresponding change in the standards for the admissibility of
proposed solutions (cf. Stillwaggon Swan and Bruce 2011). For example,
Newton&rsquo;s theory was initially widely rejected because it did not
explain the attractive forces between matter, something required of
any mechanics from the perspective of the proponents of Aristotle and
Descartes&rsquo; theories (Kuhn 1962, 148). According to Kuhn, with
the acceptance of Newton&rsquo;s theory, this question was banished
from science as illegitimate, only to re-emerge with the solution
offered by general relativity. He concluded that scientific
revolutions alter the very definition of science itself.</p>

<p>
Changes in problems and standards come with corresponding conceptual
changes, so that after a revolution, many (though not all) of the
older concepts are still used, but in a slightly modified way. Such
conceptual changes have both intentional and extensional aspects,
which is to say that the same terms take on different meanings and are
used to refer to different things when used by proponents of competing
incommensurable theories. The changes in the intentional aspects of
concepts result because the terms used to express a theory are
inter-defined and their meanings depend on the theories to which they
belong. For example, the meanings of the terms
&lsquo;temperature&rsquo;, &lsquo;mass&rsquo;, &lsquo;chemical
element&rsquo;, and &lsquo;chemical compound&rsquo; depend on which
theories are used to interpret them. Conceptual changes also result in
the exclusion of some old elements of the extension of a concept,
while new elements come to be subsumed by it so that the same term
comes to refer to different things. For example, the term
&lsquo;Planet&rsquo; referred to the sun but not the earth in the
Ptolemaic theory, whereas it refers to the earth and not the sun in
the Copernican theory. Incommensurable theories use some of the same
terms, but with different meanings, to refer to different sets of
things. Two scientists who perceive the same situation differently,
but nevertheless use the same vocabulary to describe it, speak from
incommensurable viewpoints (Kuhn 1970, 201).</p>

<p>
One of the most controversial claims to emerge from Kuhn&rsquo;s
assertions about the incommensurability of scientific theories is that
the proponents of different paradigms work in different worlds (Kuhn
1962, 150; cf. Hoyningen-Huene 1990; 1993; 2021, 2022, 2023), but see
also the metaphorical-psychological interpretation of world change in
(Bird, 2012), pp. 869, 871). Drawing on experiments in the psychology
of perception, Kuhn argued that the rigorous training required for
admittance to a paradigm conditions scientist&rsquo;s reactions,
expectations and beliefs (Kuhn 1962, 128; 2000 [1989], 66&ndash;71),
so that learning how to apply the concepts of a theory to solve
exemplary problems determines scientists&rsquo; experiences. For
example, where a proponent of the Newtonian theory sees a pendulum, an
Aristotelian saw constrained free fall; where Priestley saw
dephlogisticated air, Lavoisier saw oxygen; where Berthollet saw a
compound that could vary in proportion, Proust saw only a physical
mixture. Kuhn (and Feyerabend) used the analogy of a Gestalt switch to
illustrate this point. In this way, one main source of the notion of
incommensurability of scientific theories has been the development of
Gestalt psychology.</p>

<p>
According to Kuhn, these three interrelated aspects of
incommensurability (changes in problems and standards that define a
discipline, changes in the concepts used to state and solve those
problems, and world change) jointly constrain the interpretation of
scientific advance as cumulative. Scientific progress, Kuhn argued, is
not simply the continual discovery of new facts duly explained.
Instead, revolutions change what counts as the facts in the first
place. When reigning theories are replaced by incommensurable
challengers, the purported facts are re-described according to new and
incompatible theoretical principles. The main goal of Kuhn&rsquo;s
<em>Structure</em> was to challenge the idea of scientific progress as
cumulative, according to which what is corrected or discarded in the
course of scientific advance is that which was never really scientific
in the first place, and Kuhn used incommensurability as the basis of
his challenge. Instead of understanding scientific progress as a
process of change toward some fixed truth, Kuhn compared his
suggestion to that of Darwin: scientific progress is like evolution in
that its development should be understood without reference to a
fixed, permanent goal (1962, 173).</p>

<h3 id="KuhnRoutInco">2.2 Kuhn&rsquo;s route to incommensurability</h3>

<h4>2.2.1 Kuhn&rsquo;s discovery of incommensurability</h4>

<p>
According to Kuhn, he discovered incommensurability as a graduate
student in the mid to late 1940s while struggling with what appeared
to be nonsensical passages in Aristotelian physics (Kuhn 2000 [1989],
59&ndash;60). He could not believe that someone as extraordinary as
Aristotle could have written them. Eventually, patterns in the
disconcerting passages began to emerge, and then all at once, the text
made sense to him: a Gestalt switch that resulted when he changed the
meanings of some of the central terms. He saw this process of meaning
changing as a method of historical recovery. He realized that in his
earlier encounters, he had been projecting contemporary meanings back
into his historical sources (Whiggish history), and that he would need
to peel them away to remove the distortion and understand the
Aristotelian system in its own right (hermeneutic history). For
instance, when he encountered the word &ldquo;motion&rdquo; in
Aristotle (the standard translation of the Greek <em>kinesis</em>), he
was thinking in terms of the change of position of objects in space
(as we do today). But to get more closely at Aristotle&rsquo;s
original usage, he had to expand the meaning of motion to cover a much
broader range of phenomena that include various other sorts of change,
such as growth and diminution, alternation, and generation and
corruption, making the motion of an object in space (displacement or
&lsquo;locomotion&rsquo;) just a special case of motion. Kuhn realized
that these sorts of conceptual differences indicated breaks between
different modes of thought, and he suspected that such breaks must be
significant both for the nature of knowledge and for the sense in
which the development of knowledge can be said to make progress.
Having made this discovery, Kuhn changed his career plans, leaving
theoretical physics to pursue this strange phenomenon. Some fifteen
years later the term &lsquo;incommensurable&rsquo; first appears in
his classic <em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em>
(1962).</p>

<h4>2.2.2 Conceptual replacement and theory-ladenness of observation: Ludwik Fleck</h4>

<p>
Of all the sources influencing Kuhn on incommensurability, at least
one deserves special attention. In the foreword of <em>The Structure
of Scientific Revolutions</em>, Kuhn acknowledged a deep debt to
Ludwik Fleck, a bacteriologist who developed the first explicit
sociology of science, anticipating many contemporary views about the
social construction of knowledge. Around 1950, Kuhn was enticed by the
potential relevance to his experience of incommensurability of
Fleck&rsquo;s paradoxical title: <em>Entstehung und Entwicklung einer
wissenschaftlichen Tatsache: Einf&uuml;hrung in die Lehre von Denkstil
und Denkkollektiv</em> (1935) <em>(Genesis and Development of a
Scientific Fact</em>, 1979). There and in other earlier works, Fleck
had already used &lsquo;inkommensurabel&rsquo; to describe different
styles of thinking within the natural sciences as well as to discuss
the ramifications of radical conceptual change in the history of
science. For example, Fleck used the term
&lsquo;inkommensurabel&rsquo; to describe the differences between
&lsquo;medical thinking&rsquo; and &lsquo;scientific thinking&rsquo;.
The former addresses irregular, temporally dynamic phenomena such as
illness, while the latter addresses uniform phenomena (Fleck 1986
[1927], 44&ndash;45). Fleck also used the term
&lsquo;inkommensurabel&rsquo; to describe conceptual replacements in
theoretical transitions within what he considered the most vital of
the natural sciences, the medical sciences. For example, he claimed
that an old concept of disease became incommensurable with a newer
concept that was not a completely adequate substitute for it (Fleck
1979 [1935], 62). While Fleck&rsquo;s program of comparative
epistemology anticipates Kuhn&rsquo;s ideas in many significant
respects, it is also strikingly different in others (Harwood 1986;
Oberheim 2006; Peine 2011). The most pervasive differences concerning
incommensurability are that Fleck treats meaning and meaning change as
a function of how concepts are received and developed by collectives,
while for Kuhn it is individuals who develop and apply concepts that
advance science. Moreover, for Fleck, meaning change is a gradual,
continuous feature of scientific development, whereas Kuhn
distinguishes normal scientific development that does not radically
change meanings from revolutionary breaks that do.</p>

<p>
Even so, Fleck had emphasized all three of the interrelated aspects of
the shifts that Kuhn called scientific revolutions that result in
&lsquo;incommensurability&rsquo; (changes in problems and standards
(1979 [1935], 75&ndash;76; 1979 [1936], 89), conceptual change (e.g.
1979 [1935]; 1979 [1936], 72, 83) and world change (e.g. 1986 [1936],
112). Fleck also argued that science does not approach the truth
because successive thought-styles raise new problems and discard older
forms of knowledge (Fleck 1986 [1936], 111&ndash;112; 1979 [1935], 19,
51, 137&ndash;139; cf. Harwood 1986, 177). Fleck emphasized that
scientific terms acquire their meanings through their application
within a particular theoretical context and that those meanings change
when theories change in the course of advance, illustrating his point
with the example of &lsquo;chemical elements&rsquo; and
&lsquo;compounds&rsquo; repeated by Kuhn (Fleck 1979 [1935], 25, 39,
40, 53&ndash;54). Fleck emphasized the theory-ladenness of observation
with explicit reference to Gestalt switches; stressing that a
&lsquo;thought-style&rsquo; determines not only the meanings of its
concepts but also the perception of phenomena to be explained,
illustrating his claims with examples from the history of anatomical
representation (1979 [1935], 66; 1986 [1947]). Fleck (like Kuhn,
Feyerabend, and Wittgenstein) acknowledged Wolfgang
K&ouml;hler&rsquo;s earlier work in the psychology of perception in
this regard, see below (Oberheim 2006). Fleck concluded that
scientific advance is not cumulative, that conceptual differences
between members of different scientific communities cause
communication difficulties between them (1979 [1936], 109), and later
for historians trying to understand older ideas (1979 [1936],
83&ndash;85, 89). Fleck even emphasized that meaning change through
scientific advance causes translation failure between theories,
anticipating a central aspect of Kuhn&rsquo;s later notion of
taxonomic incommensurability (e.g. 1986 [1936], 83).</p>

<h4>2.2.3 Gestalt psychology and organized perception</h4>

<p>
Another major source of Kuhn&rsquo;s idea of the incommensurability of
scientific theories is Gestalt psychology (Kuhn 1962, vi). Wolfgang
K&ouml;hler had emphasized the active role of organization in
perception and argued that in psychology one begins with
<em>Gestalten</em> (organized, segregated wholes such as the objects
of human perception or identifiable human behaviors) and then proceeds
to discover their natural parts (and not vice versa, like in particle
physics). In the opening sentences of the condensed English version of
K&ouml;hler&rsquo;s investigation of the relationship between the
mental concepts of psychology and the material concepts of physics,
K&ouml;hler wrote: &ldquo;In order to orient itself in the company of
natural sciences, psychology must discover connections wherever it can
between its own phenomena and those of other disciplines. If this
search fails, then psychology must recognize that its categories and
those of natural science are incommensurable&rdquo; (1938 [1920],
17).</p>

<h4>2.2.4 The image of art and the image of science</h4>

<p>
In a preliminary draft, &ldquo;The Structure of Scientific
Revolutions, Chapter 1, What are Scientific Revolutions?&rdquo; (dated
1958&ndash;1960, likely composed in late 1958) of the first chapter of
his projected book, Kuhn initially used the idea of incommensurability
to characterize stages of development in the arts in contrast to the
traditional image of scientific progress as cumulative that he set out
to challenge (see Pinto de Oliveira, 2017). Although this draft
chapter was entirely rewritten as the introduction of Kuhn (1962), and
was explicitly intended only to provoke exploratory discussion and not
for publication, it strongly suggests that, at that time, Kuhn began
to develop the idea of the incommensurability in science in reaction
to the traditional (e.g. Sarton, Conant) contrast between development
in the arts and cumulative progress in the sciences (see Pinto de
Oliveira, 2017). In the draft, Kuhn announced his project as an
attempt to reshape the image of science so as to make it closer to the
image of art (see Pinto de Oliveira, 2017). He wanted to challenge the
cumulative conception of scientific progress promoted by the old
historiography of science, according to which &ldquo;science appears
to advance by accretion&rdquo; and science is &ldquo;an ever-growing
edifice to which each scientist strives to add a few stones or a bit
of mortar&rdquo; (Kuhn 1958, 2, as cited in Pinto de Oliveira 2017,
748) in contrast to the image of art according to which &ldquo;the
transition between one stage of artistic development and the next is a
transition between incommensurables&rdquo; (Kuhn 1958, 3, as cited in
Pinto de Oliveira 2017, 749).</p>

<p>
A few pages later, Kuhn proceeds to apply the idea of
incommensurability to science for the very first time, again while
comparing scientific revolutions to the non-cumulative nature of
progress in the arts: &ldquo;Often a decision to embrace a new theory
turns out to involve an implicit redefinition of the corresponding
science. Old problems may be relegated to another science or may be
declared entirely &lsquo;unscientific&rsquo;. Problems that, on the
old theory, were non-existent or trivial may, with a new theory,
become the very archetypes of significant scientific achievement. And,
as the problems change, so, often, does the standard that
distinguishes a real scientific solution from a mere metaphysical
speculation, word game, or mathematical play. It follows that, to a
significant extent, the science that emerges from a scientific
revolution is not only incompatible, but often actually
incommensurable, with that which has gone before. Only as this is
realized, can we grasp the full sense in which scientific revolutions
are like those in the arts&rdquo; (Kuhn 1958, 17&ndash;18 as cited in
Pinto de Oliveira 2017, 756). Kuhn concludes that &ldquo;If we are to
preserve any part of the metaphor which makes inventions and
discoveries new bricks for the scientific edifice, and if we are
simultaneously to give resistance and controversy an essential place
in the development of science, then we may have to recognize that the
addition of new bricks demands at least partial demolition of the
existing structure, and that the new edifice erected to include the
new brick is not just the old one plus, but a new building. We may,
that is, be forced to recognize that new discoveries and new theories
do not simply add to the stock of pre-existing scientific knowledge.
They change it.&rdquo; (Kuhn 1958, 7, as cited in Pinto de Oliveira
2017, 756).</p>

<h3 id="KuhnSubsDeveInco">2.3 Kuhn&rsquo;s subsequent development of incommensurability</h3>

<p>
Kuhn continued to struggle with, develop, and then refine his
understanding of incommensurability until his death in 1996. Although
his development of incommensurability went through several stages (cf.
Hoyningen-Huene 1993, 206&ndash;222), he claimed to have made a
&ldquo;series of significant breakthroughs&rdquo; beginning in 1987
(Kuhn 2000 [1993], 228). They are described in several essays and
published lectures that were collected in (Kuhn 2000, cf. chs. 3, 4,
5, 10 &amp; 11), and an unfinished book entitled <em>The Plurality of
Worlds: An Evolutionary Theory of Scientific Development</em>. Kuhn
only wrote six out of nine planned chapters of the book that was
published, together with other writings (Mladenovic, 2022). The
relationships among Kuhn&rsquo;s posthumously published writing that
partly overlap have been analyzed in (Melogno, 2023). The nature of
these developments is controversial. Some commentators claim that
Kuhn&rsquo;s incommensurability thesis underwent a &lsquo;major
transformation&rsquo; (Sankey 1993), while others (including Kuhn
himself) see only a more specific characterization of the original
core insight (Hoyningen-Huene 1993, 212; Kuhn 2000, [1983], 33ff.;
Chen 1997). Kuhn&rsquo;s original holistic characterization of
incommensurability is now distinguished into two separate theses.
&lsquo;Taxonomic incommensurability&rsquo; involves conceptual change
in contrast to &lsquo;methodological incommensurability&rsquo;, which
involves the epistemic values used to evaluate theories (Sankey 1991;
Sankey and Hoyningen-Huene 2001; see Section 2.3.2 below).</p>

<h4>2.3.1 Taxonomic incommensurability</h4>

<p>
Kuhn continued to struggle with, develop, and then refine his
understanding of incommensurability until his death in 1996. Although
his development of incommensurability went through several stages (cf.
Hoyningen-Huene 1993, 206&ndash;222), he claimed to have made a
&ldquo;series of significant breakthroughs&rdquo; beginning in 1987
(Kuhn 2000 [1993], 228). They are described in several essays and
published lectures that were collected in (Kuhn 2000, cf. chs. 3, 4,
5, 10 &amp; 11), and an unfinished book entitled <em>The Plurality of
Worlds: An Evolutionary Theory of Scientific Development</em>. Kuhn
only wrote six out of nine planned chapters of the book that was
published, together with other writings (Mladenovic, 2022). The
relationships among Kuhn&rsquo;s posthumously published writing that
partly overlap have been analyzed in (Melogno, 2023). The nature of
these developments is controversial. Some commentators claim that
Kuhn&rsquo;s incommensurability thesis underwent a &lsquo;major
transformation&rsquo; (Sankey 1993), while others (including Kuhn
himself) see only a more specific characterization of the original
core insight (Hoyningen-Huene 1993, 212; Kuhn 2000, [1983], 33ff.;
Chen 1997). Kuhn&rsquo;s original holistic characterization of
incommensurability is now distinguished into two separate theses.
&lsquo;Taxonomic incommensurability&rsquo; involves conceptual change
in contrast to &lsquo;methodological incommensurability&rsquo;, which
involves the epistemic values used to evaluate theories (Sankey 1991;
Sankey and Hoyningen-Huene 2001; see Section 2.3.2 below).</p>

<p>
To help explicate incommensurability in terms of taxonomic
classification, Kuhn developed the <em>no-overlap principle</em>. The
no-overlap principle precludes cross-classification of objects into
different kinds within a theory&rsquo;s taxonomy. According to the
no-overlap principle, no two kind terms may overlap in their referents
unless they are related as species to genus. For example, there are no
dogs that are also cats; no gold that is also silver, and that is what
makes the terms &lsquo;dogs&rsquo;, &lsquo;cats&rsquo;,
&lsquo;silver&rsquo;, and &lsquo;gold&rsquo; kind terms (Kuhn 2000
[1991], 92). Such kind terms are used to state laws and theories and
must be learned <em>together</em> through experience (2000 [1993],
230; cf. Barker et al. 2003, 214 ff.). There are two possibilities.
Most kind terms must be learned as members of one or another contrast
set. For example, to learn the term &lsquo;liquid&rsquo;, one must
also master the terms &lsquo;solid&rsquo; and &lsquo;gas&rsquo;. Other
types of kind terms are not learned through contrast sets, but
together with closely related terms through their joint application to
situations that exemplify natural laws. For example, the term
&lsquo;force&rsquo; must be learned together with terms like
&lsquo;mass&rsquo; and &lsquo;weight&rsquo; through an application of
Hooke&rsquo;s law and either Newton&rsquo;s three laws of motion or
else the first and third laws together with the law of gravity (2000
[1993], 231). According to Kuhn, scientific revolutions change the
structural relations between pre-existing kind terms, breaking the
no-overlap principle (2000 [1991], 92&ndash;96]. This is to say that
theories separated by a revolution cross-classify the same things into
mutually exclusive sets of kinds. A kind from one taxonomy is mutually
exclusive with another if it cannot simply be introduced into it
because the objects to which it refers would be subject to different
sets of natural laws. This would result in conflicting expectations
about the same objects, loss of logical relations between statements
made with those concepts, and ultimately incoherence and
miscommunication (Kuhn 2000 [1993], 232, 238). For example,
Ptolemy&rsquo;s theory classifies the sun as a planet, where planets
orbit the earth, while Copernicus&rsquo; theory classifies the sun as
a star, where planets orbit stars like the sun. A correct statement
according to Copernican theory, such as &ldquo;Planets orbit the
sun&rdquo; is incoherent in Ptolemaic vocabulary (2000 [1991], 94). It
could not even have been made without abandoning the Ptolemaic
concepts and developing new ones to <em>replace</em> (and not
supplement) them.</p>

<p>
Furthermore, Kuhn (in a move toward Feyerabend&rsquo;s view) later
claims that the same types of difficulties in communication that arise
due to incommensurability between members of different scientific
communities separated by the passage of time <em>also</em> occur
between members of different contemporaneous sub-disciplines that
result from scientific revolutions (Kuhn 2000 [1993], 238). This
represents a significant change to his original phase-model of
scientific advance, and a corresponding shift in his application of
the notion of incommensurability. Kuhn no longer represents scientific
advance as a linear progression from pre-normal science to normal
science, through crisis to revolution that results in a new phase of
normal science; and incommensurability is no longer restricted just to
diachronic episodes of scientific advance in which two theories are
separated by a revolution. Instead, scientific revolutions are
compared to the process of speciation in biology, in that disciplines
branch into sub-disciplines that resemble a phylogenetic tree in which
contemporaneous sub-disciplines that result from scientific
revolutions can also be incommensurable. This incommensurability
derives from different training required to master the incompatible
kind terms used to state their laws and theories. These shared kind
terms cross-classify the same set of objects into different sets of
kinds, resulting in mutually exclusive lexical taxonomies that break
the no-overlap principle. Moreover, now not only are both processes
(scientific progress and biological evolution) similar in that they
are not fixed in advance by some set goal (i.e. truth), but driven
from behind (i.e. away from anomalies that play an analogous role to
selection pressure), but also the function of incommensurability
between scientific theories is presented as analogous to the isolating
mechanisms required for speciation (Kuhn 2000 [1991],
94&ndash;99).</p>

<p>
Kuhn compared the function of lexical taxonomies to Kant&rsquo;s <em>a
priori</em> when taken in a relativized sense. Each lexicon makes a
corresponding form of life possible within which the truth or falsity
of propositions may be both claimed and rationally justified. For
example, with the Aristotelian lexicon, one can speak of the truth or
falsity of Aristotelian assertions, but these truth values have no
bearing on the truth of apparently similar assertions made with the
Newtonian lexicon (Kuhn 2000 [1993], 244). A lexicon is thus
<em>constitutive</em> of the objects of knowledge (Kuhn 2000 [1993],
245); and consequently, Kuhn rejected characterizations of scientific
progress according to which science zeros in on the truth:
&ldquo;<em>no shared metric</em> is available to compare our
assertions &hellip; and thus to provide a basis for a claim that our
(or, for that matter, his) are closer to the truth&rdquo; (2000
[1993], 244). Instead, the logical status of a lexical structure, like
that of word meanings in general, is that of convention, and the
justification of a lexicon or of lexical change can only be pragmatic
(2000 [1993], 244). Kuhn thus reaffirmed his earlier claim that the
notion of a match or correspondence between the ontology of a theory
and its real counterpart in nature is illusive in principle (1970,
206; 2000 [1993], 244). The implications that incommensurability has
for scientific realism have been widely discussed and continue to be
controversial (cf. Oberheim and Hoyningen-Huene 1997; Devitt 2001;
Sankey 2009; Oberheim 2024). </p>

<p>
A lexicon is not only prerequisite to making meaningful statements, it
also sets limits on what can be meaningfully said within the community
of speakers that share it: &ldquo;There is, for example, no way, even
in an enriched Newtonian vocabulary, to convey the Aristotelian
propositions regularly misconstrued as asserting the proportionality
of force and motion or the impossibility of a void. Using our
conceptual lexicon, these Aristotelian propositions cannot be
expressed &mdash; they are simply ineffable &mdash; and we are barred
by the no-overlap principle from access to the concepts required to
express them&rdquo; (Kuhn 2000 [1993], 244; cf. 2000 [1989], 76). In
this way, Kuhn&rsquo;s later notion of the incommensurability of
scientific theories is based on <em>effability</em>. The structure of
the lexicon shared by a particular community determines how the world
can be described by its members, as well as how they will
misunderstand the history of their own discipline; that is, unless
they learn to understand older terms according to the structure of the
older lexicon. Where Kuhn had earlier likened the process by which
historians come to understand antiquated science as a special type of
translation, he retracted these claims, insisting that the process is
one of language learning, not translation (2000 [1993], 238, 244).
Kuhn often claimed that incommensurable theories are untranslatable
(e.g. Kuhn 2000 [1991], 94). However, he also emphasized that
translation is neither needed in the comparison of incommensurable
theories, nor in the hermeneutic historical method necessary to
understand antiquated sciences (Kuhn 2000 [1993], 237, 238, 244). To
overcome the barriers posed by incommensurability to understanding
antiquated sciences, and to understanding the special technical
vocabulary used by contemporaneous, phylogenetically related
sub-disciplines, it is neither necessary nor possible to translate
between them. Rather, one must become <em>bilingual</em>, learning to
use (and keep separate) the incongruently structured lexical
taxonomies underwriting different laws and theories.</p>

<h4>2.3.2 Methodological incommensurability</h4>

<p>
As Kuhn refined his notion of incommensurability as a special type of
conceptual incompatibility, some commentators began to distinguish it
from &lsquo;methodological incommensurability&rsquo;. Methodological
incommensurability is the idea that there are no shared, objective
standards of scientific theory appraisal, so that there are no
external or neutral standards that univocally determine the
comparative evaluation of competing theories (Sankey and
Hoyningen-Huene 2001, xiii). This idea has also been recently
discussed in detail under the rubric
&ldquo;Kuhn-underdetermination&rdquo; (Carrier 2008, 278). The basic
idea was developed out of Kuhn and Feyerabend&rsquo;s rejections of
the traditional view that a distinguishing feature of science is a
uniform, invariant scientific method, that remains fixed throughout
its development (Kuhn 1962, 94, 103; Feyerabend 1975, 23&ndash;32; cf.
Farrell 2003). Feyerabend famously argued that every proposed
methodological rule has been fruitfully violated at some point in the
course of scientific advance, and that only by breaking such rules
could scientists have made the progressive steps for which they are
praised (1975). He concluded that the idea of a fixed, historically
invariant scientific method is a myth. There are no universally
applicable methodological rules. The only methodological rule that is
universally applicable is &lsquo;anything goes&rsquo;, which buys its
universality at the cost of being completely empty (1970a, 105). Kuhn
challenged the traditional view of scientific method as a set of
rules, claiming that the standards of theory appraisal, such as
simplicity, accuracy, consistency, scope, and fruitfulness (1977,
322), depend on and vary with the currently dominant paradigm. He is
often cited for having pointed out that as in political revolutions,
so in choice of paradigm, there is no standard higher than the assent
of the relevant community (1962, 94), and as having argued that there
is &ldquo;no neutral algorithm for theory choice, no systematic
decision procedure which, properly applied, must lead each individual
in the group to the same decision&rdquo; (1970, 200). Kuhn developed
the idea that such epistemic standards do not function as rules that
determine rational theory choice, but as values that merely guide it
(1977, 331). Different scientists apply these values differently, and
they may even pull in different directions, so that there may be
rational disagreement between scientists from incommensurable
paradigms, who support different theories due to their weighing the
same values differently.</p>

<h2 id="CombConcConsPaulFeyeInco">3. Combating conceptual conservatism: Paul Feyerabend on incommensurability</h2>

<p>
In Feyerabend&rsquo;s philosophy, incommensurability is a specific
form of &ldquo;conceptual disparity&rdquo; that results in
incompatible interpretations of reality (1970b, 222). For there to be
incommensurability: &ldquo;The situation must be rigged in such a way
that the conditions of concept formation in one theory <em>forbid</em>
the formation of the basic concepts of the other&rdquo; (1970b, 222;
1978, 68; and 1975, 269), so that the new theory entails that
&ldquo;all the concepts of the preceding theory have <em>zero
extension</em>&rdquo; because the new theory introduces &ldquo;rules
that change the system of classes itself&rdquo; (1965c, 268).
Incommensurable theories are incompatible both conceptually and
ontologically. They use incompatible sets of concepts to state
mutually exclusive accounts of reality. They are conceptually
incompatible because of meaning variance in the terms used to state
the rival theories. They are ontologically incompatible because
according to the new theory, the general descriptive terms used to
state the established view do not in fact refer to real kinds of
things; therefore, if one is true, then the other cannot be. According
to Feyerabend, two theories are incommensurable <em>because</em> the
meanings of the terms used to state them are determined by rival
theoretical principles that govern their use, and these principles
imply incompatible explanations of reality (1962, 58). Or put another
way, two theories are incommensurable: &ldquo;When the meaning of
their main descriptive terms depend on mutually inconsistent
[ontological] principles&rdquo; (1965c, 227; cf. 1975, 269&ndash;270,
276), so that &ldquo;a theory is incommensurable with another if
[their] ontological consequences are incompatible&rdquo; (1981a,
xi).</p>

<p>
With respect to normative methodology (Popper&rsquo;s logic of
scientific inquiry), the main consequences of incommensurability
follow from the fact that incommensurable theories are <em>deductively
disjoint</em>. Because the terms used to state the theories have
different meanings, the main concepts of one can neither be defined
based on the primitive descriptive terms of the other, nor formally
related to them via correct empirical statements deduced from them
(1962, 74, 90), so that for Feyerabend, incommensurability just means
&ldquo;deductive disjointedness, and nothing else&rdquo; (1977, 365).
By calling rival theories deductively disjoint or
&ldquo;incommensurable&rdquo;, Feyerabend is claiming that in
scientific revolutions, the established theory cannot be deduced from
the new theory, nor can predictions deduced from the established
theory enter formal relations with the new theory or any predictions
deduced from it. Put more directly, if two theories are
incommensurable, then one theory cannot be deduced from the other, nor
can any of the predictions deduced from one theory be formally
consistent or inconsistent with any predictions deduced from the
other, or as Feyerabend put it, &ldquo;incommensurable theories may
not possess any comparable consequences, observational or
otherwise&rdquo; (1962, 94). Feyerabend often emphasizes that
&ldquo;this does not mean that a person may not, on different
occasions, use concepts which belong to different and incommensurable
frameworks. The only thing that is forbidden for him is the use of
both kinds of concepts in the same argument; for example, he may not
use the one kind of concept in his observation language and the other
kind in his theoretical language&rdquo; (1962, 83).</p>

<p>
To explain incommensurability, Feyerabend develops what he took to be
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s views on meaning, specifically his nominalism and
constructivism, with what he called a <em>contextual theory of
meaning</em>, according to which a term does not have meaning
independent of its use in a specific context, and its meaning is
determined by the theory with which it is interpreted. This has the
peculiar result, according to Feyerabend, that due to meaning variance
in the terms used state rival theories, one sentence will covertly
make two incompatible statements, when it is deduced from rival
incommensurable theories and used to test them. Similarly, when two
sentences that <em>prima faci</em>a directly logically contradict each
other (&ldquo;The ball fell down&rdquo;, &ldquo;The ball did not fall
down&rdquo;) are deduced from incommensurable rival theories, even
though they may look like they formally contradict each other, they
cannot because of meaning variance in the terms from which they were
deduced. Feyerabend argues that for predictions to count as evidence
for or against a theory, they must be deduced from that theory, and
therefore, the same experimental results must be given incompatible
interpretations that can have no formal relations when they are when
they are used to test incommensurable rivals. In Feyerabend&rsquo;s
example, the sentence &lsquo;The ball fell down&rsquo; will mean
&lsquo;The ball was pushed down by its impetus toward its natural
place&rsquo;, or it will mean &lsquo;it was pulled by gravity toward
the Earth&rsquo;s center of mass&rsquo;, depending on whether an
Aristotelian or Newtonian theory is used to interpret it (1962, 56,
citing Clagett 1959). Similarly, the terms &lsquo;mass&rsquo; and
&lsquo;space&rsquo; mean something different in classical mechanics
and relativity theory, which imply incompatible accounts of reality.
If one of these theories is true, then the other cannot be. Either
objects have an absolute mass and move in space that is inert, or
objects have a rest mass and a relative mass and move in space that
can bend and stretch. Because the meanings of the terms used to state
the rival theories vary, classical mechanics cannot be deduced from
relativity theory; and predictions deduced from classical mechanics
can neither be logically consistent with (nor can they logically
contradict) any predictions deduced from relativity theory. For this
reason, according to Feyerabend, relativity theory cannot explain the
successful predictions deduced from Newton&rsquo;s theory, nor can
predictions deduced from relativity theory falsify Newton&rsquo;s
theory by logically contradicting predictions deduced from it (1962,
28&ndash;31, 93&ndash;95).</p>

<h3 id="ExplReduEmpi1962">3.1 &lsquo;Explanation, Reduction and Empiricism&rsquo; (1962)</h3>

<p>
Feyerabend&rsquo;s landmark essay, &ldquo;Explanation, Reduction and
Empiricism&rdquo; (1962), is an attempt to synthesize the best aspects
of Popper and Wittgenstein&rsquo;s views, while criticizing the worst
aspects of each (Oberheim 2024). Feyerabend tries to analyze a problem
with explanation (1962, 92, fn. 13) by developing the idea of
incommensurability to criticize three views interpreted as normative
methodologies, or accounts of the logic of scientific justification in
the Popperian sense. Hempel&rsquo;s account of <em>explanation</em>,
Nagel&rsquo;s account of <em>reductionism</em>, and Popper&rsquo;s
account of <em>empiricism</em> (also known as
&lsquo;falsificationism&rsquo;); hence, the three-word title.
Feyerabend argues that none of these three accounts can take comparing
rival incommensurable theories empirically into account, and so they
all dogmatically stifle the scientific progress that they should
promote. Then, he generalizes his argument: Due to meaning variance
that results from scientific revolutions, a formal account of
explanation cannot be given (1962, 95). Put simply, today&rsquo;s best
theories cannot explain antiquated facts, because those facts cannot
be deduced from them. Therefore, any methodology that implies that to
be acceptable as a replacement for an established view, a new theory
should have to explain the successful predictions deduced from it is
antihumanitarian because it would stifle the progress it should
promote.</p>

<p>
According to Feyerabend, Hempel&rsquo;s account of explanation implies
that a statement is explained by an explanation by being deduced from
it and that one explanation should replace another if it explains
everything the existing theory explains plus more. According to
Feyerabend, this is not possible whenever the rival explanations are
incommensurable (&lsquo;deductively disjoint&rsquo;) due to meaning
variance in the terms used to state the explanations. If new proposed
explanations should have to explain (by deduction) everything the
established explanations explain (by deduction) to justify replacing
the established explanation with the new proposal, then revolutionary
scientific advances that result in meaning variance would never be
justifiable. For this reason, Hempel&rsquo;s account of explanation
interpreted as a normative methodology has antihumanitarian
consequences because it stifles the progress it should promote.</p>

<p>
According to Feyerabend, Nagel&rsquo;s account of reduction implies
that the new theory should explain the established theory (or some
form of it) by being shown to be deducible from it (as a limiting
case), or in other words, the new theory explains (be deduction) the
established theory in an explanation by &lsquo;reduction&rsquo;.
According to Feyerabend, this is not possible if the rival theories
are incommensurable. If new theories should have to explain
established theories by showing that they (or some version of them)
can be deduced from the new theory (or some version of it), then
revolutionary scientific advances would never be justifiable.
Moreover, as Popper has shown, according to Feyerabend, if the
existing theory were a deductive consequence of the new theory, then
the new theory could not predict &ndash; by deduction &ndash; a
statement that falsifies the existing theory. Thus, Nagel&rsquo;s
account of reduction interpreted as a normative methodology also has
antihumanitarian consequences because it stifles the progress it
should promote.</p>

<p>
According to Feyerabend, Popper&rsquo;s account of empiricism implies
that the new theory should <em>falsify</em> the established theory by
meeting two conditions. First, it should predict (by deduction) all
the statements the existing theory successfully predicted (by
deduction) so that the evidence for the existing theory becomes
evidence for the new theory and is explained by it (assuming that the
new theory is true). Second, the new theory should correctly predict a
statement that formally contradicts a statement deduced from the
established view (1962, 91&ndash;93). According to Feyerabend, due to
meaning variance in the terms used to state incommensurable rival
theories, neither of these conditions can be met. The new theory
cannot explain (by deduction) the predictions that were successfully
deduced from the existing theory because of meaning variance (1962,
94), nor can a successful prediction deduced from the new theory
falsify the existing theory by formally contradicting an unsuccessful
prediction deduced from the existing theory (1962, 94, fn. 115).
Feyerabend concludes that Popper&rsquo;s methodology:</p>

<blockquote>
can well deal with all the problems that arise when <em>T</em> and
<em>T</em>&prime; are commensurable, but inconsistent inside
<em>D</em>&prime;. It does not seem to me that it can deal with the
case where <em>T</em>&prime; and <em>T</em> are incommensurable.
(1962, 93)
</blockquote>

<p>
According to Feyerabend, by inadvertently implying meaning invariance
in the terms used to test rival theories, which would be required to
establish formal relations between them, Popper&rsquo;s empiricism is
much closer to the dogmatic school philosophies, such as Platonism and
Cartesianism, from which it tries to distance itself (1962,
30&ndash;31). Moreover, the reason traditional philosophical problems
such as the mind-body problem, the problem of the reality of the
external world, and the problem of other minds perpetually persist is
that the disputants resist the kind of meaning change necessary for
their dissolution (1962, 31, 90). Similarly, Wittgenstein&rsquo;s
genuinely philosophical (pseudo-)problems (not genuine philosophical
problems) perpetually re-occur, because antiquated incommensurable
theoretical principles continue to haunt contemporary everyday
language use. This happens because we continue to use the same terms
to mean radically different things based on incompatible ontological
principles after scientific revolutions. Throughout the 1960s,
Feyerabend&rsquo;s papers adamantly argued that everyday language
should be perpetually revised and corrected to reflect the ontological
implications of our current best theories (Feyerabend 1962; 1964;
1969).</p>

<p>
By calling two theories incommensurable, Feyerabend did not mean to
imply that they were not empirically comparable or comparatively
untestable. For Feyerabend, falsifiability is not synonymous with
testability. Feyerabend developed an alternative test model for
empirically comparing incommensurable rivals, which he illustrated
with the example of Einstein&rsquo;s prediction of the stochastic
character of Brownian motion as a &ldquo;crucial experiment&rdquo;
between two incommensurable rivals: the kinetic theory (and atomism)
and classical phenomenological thermodynamics (and energeticism)
(1962, 66). In Feyerabend&rsquo;s test model, in contrast to
falsificationism, the new theory is better corroborated than the
existing theory because it predicts a novel phenomenon that cannot be
explained by the existing theory. Moreover, the existing theory, by
itself, could never even have discovered the fact that the phenomenon
in question refutes it because the existing theory implies incorrect
basic postulates that are incompatible with the basic postulates
needed to explain the phenomenon and thereby prove that it refutes the
existing theory. In this way, the new theory undermines its
rival&rsquo;s ontology without falsifying it by logically
contradicting predictions deduced from it. Put more directly, in
contrast to Popper&rsquo;s conjectures and refutations,
Feyerabend&rsquo;s theoretical pluralism is based on conjectures and
novel corroborations. It follows from Feyerabend&rsquo;s view that
universal framework theories are never formally falsified, because
they can always be protected from direct refutations by <em>ad
hoc</em> maneuvers (a lesson he had learned firsthand from his
Ehrenhaft experience in the late 1940s), and they cannot be indirectly
refuted by falsification due to meaning invariance (Oberheim 2024).
Through to <em>Against Method</em> (1993), Feyerabend repeatedly used
this test model to support a methodological argument for theoretical
pluralism. Incommensurable proposals should always be welcome because
they can increase the testability of established views. For example,
without a new incommensurable theory that correctly predicts its
stochastic character, Brownian motion could never have dethroned
classical phenomenological thermodynamics by undermining its ontology.
Feyerabend argues that this implies a contrastive account of a
theory&rsquo;s empirical content (in contrast to Popper&rsquo;s
deductive account of empirical content). Incommensurable alternatives
together with the facts they can explain are part of each
other&rsquo;s empirical content in contrast to each other, as part of
what they rule out (1962, 67; 1993, 27&ndash;28). For Feyerabend, in
scientific revolutions, established theories and the concepts used to
state them are not <em>corrected</em> and <em>absorbed</em>, and
thereby legitimized by new theories; rather, they are
<em>rejected</em> and <em>replaced</em> by better corroborated
alternatives, so that: &ldquo;Knowledge so conceived is not a process
that converges toward an ideal view; it is an ever-increasing ocean of
alternatives, each of them forcing the others into greater
articulation, all of them contributing, via this process of
competition, to the development of our mental faculties&rdquo; (1965c,
224&ndash;225; cf. 1963).</p>

<h3 id="FeyeRoutInco">3.2 Feyerabend&rsquo;s route to incommensurability</h3>

<p>
Although Feyerabend first used the term &lsquo;incommensurable&rsquo;
to describe deductively disjoint scientific theories in 1962, he had
been developing ideas about conceptual change for more than a decade.
According to Feyerabend, he initially discussed these ideas with the
Kraft Circle from 1949&ndash;1951, while working toward his doctoral
thesis on protocol statements (Feyerabend 1951; 1958). In 1952,
Feyerabend presented his notion of incommensurability to
Popper&rsquo;s seminar at the London School of Economics and also in
Elizabeth Anscombe&rsquo;s home in Oxford to Anscombe and other
Wittgensteinians, including Peter Geach, H.L.A.Hart and Georg Henrik
von Wright (1995, 92). In an &ldquo;An Attempt at a Realistic
Interpretation of Experience&rdquo; (which a condensed version of his
1951 Ph.D. thesis), Feyerabend argued for &ldquo;thesis I: <em>the
interpretation of an observation-language is determined by the
theories which we use to explain what we observe, and it changes as
soon as those theories change&rdquo;</em> (Feyerabend 1958a, 163;
Feyerabend 1993, 211). For example, according to Feyerabend, the
correct meaning of the term &lsquo;temperature&rsquo; should not be
determined by how it feels phenomenologically or by its everyday use,
but by the principles of statistical thermodynamics according to which
it is caused by molecular motion. Feyerabend argued that as older
theories are replaced, the meanings of the observational terms used to
test those theories change. This is an early version of his idea that
conceptually incompatible theories are incommensurable due to meaning
differences. In 1958, Feyerabend challenged an implicit conceptual
conservatism in logical positivism with his early notion of
incommensurability, criticizing the assumptions that theoretical terms
derive their meaning solely through their connection with experience
and that experience is a stable foundation on which theoretical
meaning can be unequivocally based. Instead of such a bottom-up
version of the relation of experience and theoretical knowledge,
according to which experience determines the meanings of our
theoretical terms, Feyerabend argued for a top-down version, according
to which our best theories determine the meanings that we attach to
our experiences. According to Feyerabend, experience cannot be taken
for granted as a neutral basis for comparing theories, because what we
experience depends on the theories that we bring to it.</p>

<p>
Karl Popper had quickly become Feyerabend&rsquo;s mentor after they
met in 1948, and there has been much controversy concerning
Feyerabend&rsquo;s evolving relationship to Popper (cf. Collodel
2016), especially given its tumultuous trajectory, and
Feyerabend&rsquo;s break with the Popperian school in 1967 (Oberheim
2024). Many factors have complicated these controversies, including
the revisions Feyerabend made concerning his debts to Popper in the
reprints of his original papers (see Preston 1997; Oberheim 2006;
Collodel 2016), informal accusations of plagiarism by Popper and
Popperians (Collodel 2016), and Feyerabend&rsquo;s subsequent
increasingly vocal denials of his debts to Popper as he tried to
distance himself from Popper and his methodology (Oberheim 2006, ch.
3.4). Many (including Popper) have interpreted Feyerabend&rsquo;s
conception of incommensurability as a rather misguided extension of
falsificationism and/or Popper&rsquo;s earlier use of
&lsquo;inkommensurabilit&auml;t&rsquo; (Bschir 2015; Collodel 2016;
Gattei and Agassi 2016). However, in 1962 Feyerabend explicitly tried
to criticize Popper&rsquo;s methodology as a dogmatic school
philosophy with a limited validity (limited to testing commensurable
theories empirically), not to extend it (Oberheim 2024). This marks
the point that Feyerabend and Popper begin to part ways concerning
their views on scientific progress and truth (Tambolo 2017). Moreover,
Feyerabend&rsquo;s 1962 criticism of Popper&rsquo;s methodology
eventually resulted in Feyerabend announcing his break from the
Popperian school in late November 1967, as can clearly be seen in his
correspondence with Imre Lakatos and John Watkins (Oberheim 2024).</p>

<p>
Feyerabend&rsquo;s route to the idea of incommensurability was
influenced by several prominent individuals, who had been discussing a
wide range of related topics. An investigation of the source of these
ideas reveals some of the founding fathers of the notion of
incommensurability in the contemporary history and philosophy of
science (see Oberheim 2006, ch. 5).</p>

<h4>3.2.1 Progress through meaning change: Pierre Duhem</h4>

<p>
Feyerabend drew heavily from Duhem&rsquo;s <em>The Aim and Structure
of Physical Theory</em> (1954 [1906]) in his development of the notion
of incommensurability of scientific theories. Many of the main points
Feyerabend emphasized by calling scientific theories incommensurable
had been developed already by Duhem, who had argued that logic is
insufficient for determining the outcome of theoretical disputes in
the natural sciences, and who documented the difficulties historians
have in understanding the development of the natural sciences due to
meaning change. Duhem also already highlighted the communication
difficulties between proponents of competing scientific theories
because of these differences in meaning. For example, Duhem had
claimed that what a physicist states as the result of an experiment is
not simply the recital of some observed facts. Rather, it is the
interpretation of these facts on the basis of the theories the
scientist regards as true (1954 [1906], 159). It follows, according to
Duhem, that in order to understand the meanings that scientists
ascribe to their own statements, it is necessary to understand the
theories that they use in order to interpret what they observe. Thus,
Duhem had stated an early version of Feyerabend&rsquo;s
incommensurability thesis. Moreover, Duhem explicitly limited his
discussion to non-instantial, physical theories, as opposed to mere
experimental laws. This is very similar to the criteria that marks the
most significant difference between Kuhn and Feyerabend&rsquo;s
development of the idea of incommensurability (see Section 4), and
that also delimits Einstein&rsquo;s use of
&lsquo;incommensurable&rsquo; while discussing the problems of theory
comparison (see Section 3.2.3).</p>

<p>
After explaining that the meaning of a term depends on the theory to
which it belongs, and that a consequence of theoretical advance is
meaning change, Duhem continued: &ldquo;If the theories admitted by
this physicist are those we accept, and if we agree to follow the same
rules in the interpretation of the same phenomena, we speak the same
language and can understand each other. But that is not always the
case. It is not so when we discuss the experiments of a physicist who
does not belong to our school; and it is especially not so when we
discuss the experiments of a physicist separated from us by fifty
years, a century, or two centuries&rdquo; (1954 [1906], 159). Duhem
continued: &ldquo;How many scientific discussions there are in which
each of the contenders claims to have crushed his adversary under the
overwhelming testimony of the facts! &hellip; How many propositions
are regarded as monstrous errors in the writings of those who have
preceded us! We should perhaps commemorate them as great truths if we
really wished to enquire into the theories which gave their
propositions their true meaning&rdquo; (Duhem 1954 [1906],
160&ndash;161). These passages make the same basic points that both
Feyerabend and Kuhn made with their claims about incommensurability of
scientific theories: Because older ideas are misunderstood, as a
result of taking them out of their theoretical context, proponents of
incommensurable scientific theories misunderstand each other, both
claiming to have the facts on their side. Kuhn and Feyerabend both
claimed that in such a situation, even empirical arguments can become
circular (Feyerabend 1965b, 152; Kuhn 1962, 94).</p>

<h4>3.2.2 The square root of 2 and complementarity: Niels Bohr</h4>

<p>
In his autobiography, Feyerabend acknowledged Niels Bohr&rsquo;s
direct influence on the development of his notion of
incommensurability in the 1950s. Feyerabend recalled a conversation in
which Bohr had talked about the discovery that the square root of two
cannot be an integer or a fraction. According to Feyerabend, Bohr
presented the event as having led to the extension of a concept of
number that retained some properties of integers and fractions, but
changed others; and claimed that the transition from classical to
quantum mechanics was carried out in accordance with precisely this
principle (1995, 78). Feyerabend also used the notion of
incommensurability to argue that Bohr&rsquo;s complementarity thesis
is an example of an unjustified conceptual conservatism, taking issue
with Bohr&rsquo;s contention that all quantum mechanical evidence will
always necessarily be expressed in classical terms (Feyerabend 1958b;
cf. 1962). He presented Bohr&rsquo;s defense of the principle of
complementarity as based on the conviction that every experience must
necessarily make its appearance within the frame of our customary
points of view, which is currently that of classical physics. However,
according to Feyerabend, even though classical concepts have been
successful in the past, and even though at the moment it may be
difficult, or even impossible, for us to imagine how to replace them,
it does not follow that the classical framework could not one day be
superseded by an incommensurable rival. Consequently, it does not
follow that all our future microscopic theories will have to take the
notion of complementarity as fundamental. Instead, according to
Feyerabend, a theory may be found whose conceptual apparatus, when
applied to the domain of validity of classical physics, would be just
as comprehensive and useful as the classical apparatus, without
coinciding with it. He claimed that such a situation is by no means
uncommon, and he used the transition from Newtonian to relativistic
physics to bolster his point. According to Feyerabend, while the
concepts of relativity theory are sufficiently rich to state all of
the facts captured by Newtonian physics, the two sets of concepts are
&ldquo;completely different&rdquo; and bear &ldquo;no logical
relations&rdquo; to each other (1958b, 83; 1961, 388; 1962,
88&ndash;89). On Feyerabend&rsquo;s fallibilist view of empirical
knowledge, no element of our knowledge can be held to be necessary or
absolutely certain. In our search for satisfactory explanations, we
are at liberty to change any parts of our existing knowledge, however
fundamental they may seem, including the concepts of classical
physics.</p>

<h4>3.2.3 &lsquo;Kant on wheels&rsquo; and universal theories: Albert Einstein</h4>

<p>
Albert Einstein used the term &lsquo;incommensurable&rsquo; to apply
specifically to difficulties selecting and evaluating scientific
theories before Kuhn and Feyerabend, and there are very strong reasons
to believe that Feyerabend&rsquo;s use of the term
&ldquo;incommensurable&rdquo; was directly inspired by
Einstein&rsquo;s use of the term (Oberheim 2016, Oberheim 2024). In
his &lsquo;Autobiographical notes&rsquo; (1949), Einstein attempted to
explain that assessing the relative merits of universal physical
theories involves making difficult judgments about their
&lsquo;naturalness&rsquo; that requires making judgments based on the
reciprocal weighing of incommensurable qualities: &ldquo;The second
point of view is not concerned with the relation to the material
observation but with the premises of the theory itself, with what may
briefly but vaguely be characterized as the &lsquo;naturalness&rsquo;
or &lsquo;logical simplicity&rsquo; of the premises (of the basic
concepts and of the relations between these which are taken as a
basis). This point of view, an exact formulation of which meets with
great difficulties, has played an important role in the selection and
evaluation of theories since time immemorial. The problem here is not
simply one of a kind of enumeration of the logically independent
premises (if anything like this were at all unequivocally possible),
but that of a kind of reciprocal weighing of incommensurable
qualities&rdquo; (1949a, 23).</p>

<p>
There are strong reasons for believing that these admittedly cryptic
remarks directly inspired Feyerabend&rsquo;s use and development of
the idea of incommensurability. In his 1962 paper, Feyerabend cites
from Bohr&rsquo;s paper, which is in same edited volume as
Einstein&rsquo;s autobiographical notes (Schilpp 1949), and David Bohm
had brought the Brownian motion example to Feyerabend&rsquo;s
attention, which is discussed by Einstein in those autobiographical
notes (Oberheim 2024). Feyerabend&rsquo;s main example illustrating
that and how incommensurable theories can be compared based on a
&lsquo;crucial experiment&rsquo; was Einstein&rsquo;s quantitative
prediction, and Perrin&rsquo;s subsequent confirmation, of Brownian
motion. Feyerabend argued that although Brownian motion was already a
well-known phenomenon, it became <em>evidence</em> for statistical
thermodynamics and against classical thermodynamics <em>only
after</em> kinetic theory was used to explain it. The crucial
experiment between these two rival theories was based on theory-laden
observations of Brownian motion that corroborated statistical
thermodynamics, but because they are theory-laden, they cannot be
stated in a <em>neutral</em> observation language. </p>

<p>
There are striking similarities between Feyerabend and
Einstein&rsquo;s uses of the term. Both make a distinction between
universal theories and lower-level theories that do not apply to the
totality of all physical appearances and then use this distinction to
limit the application of incommensurability in the same way that is to
such universal theories (cf. Feyerabend 1962, 28 and Einstein 1949a,
23), and they both apply &ldquo;incommensurable&rdquo; directly to
differences in the <em>basic concepts</em> used to state the theories.
Furthermore, Einstein&rsquo;s theoretical attitude is a form of
dynamic Kantian realism, or &ldquo;Kantian-on-wheels&rdquo; &ndash; to
use Peter Lipton&rsquo;s apt expression (Lipton 2001) &ndash; very
much like that of Feyerabend and Kuhn&rsquo;s (Oberheim 2016).
According to Einstein, his theoretical attitude &ldquo;is distinct
from that of Kant only by the fact that we do not conceive of the
&lsquo;categories&rsquo; as unalterable (conditioned by the nature of
the understanding) but as (in the logical sense) free conventions.
They appear to be <em>a priori</em> only insofar as thinking without
the positing of categories and of concepts in general would be as
impossible as is breathing in a vacuum&rdquo; (Einstein 1949b, 374).
This is the same basic perspective that both Kuhn and Feyerabend
delineated when they developed their ideas of incommensurability. For
example, Kuhn says, &ldquo;I go around explaining my own position
saying I am a Kantian with moveable categories&rdquo; (Kuhn 2000
[1995], 264), an idea developed in detail by Hoyningen-Huene (1993).
For his part, Feyerabend adopted such a &lsquo;Kant-on-wheels&rsquo;
approach in the introduction of &lsquo;Explanation, Reduction and
Empiricism&rsquo; (1962) to pursue the question: If universal theories
determine all of our experiences of the world, how can experience
still be used to test such theories? Feyerabend also defended his view
that there is no <em>fixed</em> or universal scientific method (e.g.
1975, 10&ndash;11) citing Einstein: &ldquo;The external conditions
which are set for [the scientist] by the facts of experience do not
permit him to let himself be too much restricted, in the construction
of his conceptual world, by the adherence to an epistemological
system. He therefore must appear to the systematic epistemologist as a
type of unscrupulous opportunist&rdquo; (Einstein1949b, 683ff.).
Although Feyerabend&rsquo;s development of the idea of
incommensurability of scientific theories was received by the
philosophic and scientific communities as propagating a radical,
irrationalism about science, he was actually trying to develop ideas
he had found in Einstein. In the preface to the German version of
<em>Against Method</em>, Feyerabend wrote, &ldquo;I want to emphasize
yet again that the views in this book are not new &ndash; for
physicist like Mach, Boltzmann, Einstein and Bohr they were a
triviality. But the ideas of these great thinkers have been distorted
[by positivist philosophers] beyond recognition&rdquo; (1983, 12, our
translation).</p>

<h3 id="FeyeLateNotiInco">3.3 Feyerabend&rsquo;s later notions of incommensurability</h3>

<p>
Feyerabend tried to clarify his idea of incommensurable scientific
theories throughout the 1960s as it became the cornerstone of his
peculiar brand of theoretical pluralism explicitly initially developed
in contrast to Popper, Kuhn, Putnam and Bohm&rsquo;s forms of
theoretical pluralisms (1962, 32). In <em>Against Method</em> (1975),
in addition to the incommensurability of <em>scientific theories</em>
and the worldviews they imply, Feyerabend extended the application of
this term to characterize the transition from the Greek archaic,
aggregate worldview of Homer to the substance worldview of the
Pre-Socratics (1975, 261&ndash;269). He characterized the wider notion of
incommensurability as both historical and anthropological (1975, 271),
and he tried to clarify incommensurability by suggesting that it
involves major conceptual changes to both &lsquo;overt&rsquo; and
&lsquo;covert classifications&rsquo; (in Whorff&rsquo;s sense), so
that incommensurability is difficult to define explicitly, and can
only be shown (1975, 224&ndash;225). He also started using the term in
much broader senses, discussing incommensurable frameworks of thought
and action (1975, 271), incommensurability in the domain of
perceptions (1975, 225, 271), incommensurable discoveries and
attitudes (1975, 269) and incommensurable paradigms (1981b [1970],
131&ndash;161). For Feyerabend, all these cases share the common
feature that incommensurability results from the replacement of some
form of universal principles.</p>

<h2 id="CompKuhnFeyeInco">4. A comparison of Kuhn and Feyerabend on incommensurability</h2>

<p>
Initially, Feyerabend had a more concrete characterization of the
nature and origins of incommensurability than Kuhn. Feyerabend claimed
that the interpretation of an observation language is determined by
the theories we use to explain what we observe. When our theories
about reality change, what we experience as reality changes
accordingly. Kuhn, by contrast, was initially much less sure about the
exact meaning of his notion of incommensurability, especially
regarding world change, which he saw as its most fundamental aspect.
He frankly confessed to have been at a loss: &ldquo;In a sense that I
am unable to explicate further, the proponents of competing paradigms
practice their trades in different worlds&rdquo; (1962, 150). He
suggested that &ldquo;we must learn to make sense of statements that
at least resemble these&rdquo; (1962, 121), and then spent a great
deal of effort attempting to do so.</p>

<p>
Feyerabend&rsquo;s discussion of incommensurability of scientific
theories was much more restricted than Kuhn&rsquo;s. For Kuhn,
incommensurability had three <em>prima facie</em> heterogeneous
domains, holistically bound: a change of problems and standards, a
change of concepts used to state and solve them, and a change of
worldview in which they arise. Feyerabend&rsquo;s focus, on the other
hand, was initially exclusively on concepts occurring in universal or
&lsquo;non-instantial&rsquo; theories realistically interpreted.
Ironically, however, in developments after 1962, both authors move in
opposite directions, converging toward the same views. Kuhn gradually
eliminated everything from his notion of incommensurability that does
not concern scientific concepts, and ended more or less where
Feyerabend began (see Carrier 2001; Chen 1997; Hoyningen-Huene 1990,
487&ndash;488; Hoyningen-Huene 1993, 212&ndash;218; Hoyningen-Huene
2004, Sankey 1993; Sankey 1994, 16&ndash;30; Sankey 1997). Feyerabend,
by contrast, increasingly emphasized aspects of perceptual change
(1975, 225&ndash;229, 273&ndash;274; 1978, 68; 1988, 172&ndash;176),
and also changes to the set of legitimate problems a discipline should
handle (1975, 274&ndash;275), and in his later philosophy, he
emphasizes one of Kuhn&rsquo;s original points: the role of
non-binding, epistemic values in theory choice that can result in
&lsquo;methodological&rsquo; incommensurability (cf. Farrell
2003).</p>

<p>
Concerning the range of theories that are subject to
incommensurability, again Feyerabend&rsquo;s discussion was much more
restricted than Kuhn&rsquo;s. For Feyerabend, only <em>universal</em>,
<em>non-instantial</em> theories <em>interpreted realistically</em>
can be incommensurable (Feyerabend 1962, 28, fn. 1, 44; 1965b, 216;
1975, 114, 271, 284; 1975, 221&ndash;222; 1987, 272). Feyerabend was
interested in such theories because he believed that only &ldquo;such
comprehensive structures of thought&rdquo; have ontological
implications that affect entire worldviews (Feyerabend 1962, 28;
Feyerabend 1954; cf. Oberheim 2006, 157ff.). He restricted his
discussion of incommensurability to non-instantial theories based on
their test procedures. Generalizations of the form &lsquo;All
<em>A</em>s are <em>B</em>s&rsquo; are tested by inspecting instances.
For example, Kepler&rsquo;s first law makes claims about the planets,
which can be tested directly by inspecting their motion. To test
non-instantial theories, such as Newton&rsquo;s theory of gravitation,
laws or lower-level theories must first be derived from them, and only
thereafter (and given additional auxiliary assumptions), can they be
tested by inspecting instances (Feyerabend 1962, 28, fn. 1).
Feyerabend was talking about relatively rare, large-scale revolutions
that affect entire worldviews (1987, 272). In this way, his notion was
also more Kantian than Kuhn&rsquo;s, because Feyerabend (like Kant)
was talking primarily about universal theories that determine the
meaning of thinghood itself, whereas Kuhn was talking more widely
about changes to the meaning of any set of kind terms that break the
no-overlap principle. For this reason, Kuhn included a wider range of
theories as candidates for incommensurability. For him, even smaller
episodes, like unexpected discoveries, might be incommensurable with
the earlier tradition (cf. Hoyningen-Huene 1993, 197&ndash;201). This
difference in the range of incommensurability between Kuhn and
Feyerabend&rsquo;s versions finds its most striking expression in the
way they regard the transition from the Ptolemaic to the Copernican
theory. For Kuhn, the differences between these two theories comprise
an exemplary illustration of incommensurability. For Feyerabend,
however, because planetary theory lacks the quality of universality,
there is no incommensurability (1975, 114). Furthermore, in his later
work, Kuhn insisted that the version of incommensurability he
championed had always been &ldquo;local incommensurability,&rdquo; a
notion that restricts conceptual change to a few, typically
interconnected concepts (cf. Hoyningen-Huene 1993, 213, 219). Thus,
there may be empirical consequences of incommensurable theory pairs
that can be immediately compared. For instance, the geocentric and
heliocentric planetary theories are incommensurable in Kuhn&rsquo;s
sense, while predictions of the planetary positions of both theories
are fully commensurable, and can be immediately compared regarding
their empirical accuracy. By contrast, Feyerabend always thought of
incommensurability more globally. Meaning variance in the terms used
to state the theories affects the meanings of <em>all</em> statements
derivable from those theories about anything and everything so that
incommensurable rivals have no formally comparable consequences (1962,
93; 1965c, 117; 1965b, 216; 1975, 275&ndash;276; 1981a, xi).</p>

<p>
Both Kuhn and Feyerabend have often been misread as advancing the view
that incommensurability implies incomparability (cf. Hoyningen-Huene
1993, 218ff.; Oberheim 2006, 235). In response to this misreading,
both Kuhn and Feyerabend repeatedly emphasized that incommensurability
does not imply incomparability (cf. Hoyningen-Huene 1993, 236ff.).
Theory comparison is merely more complicated than imagined by some
philosophers of science. In particular, for Kuhn, it cannot fully be
made &lsquo;point-by-point&rsquo;. It is not an algorithmic procedure
(cf. Hoyningen-Huene 1993, 147&ndash;154; Feyerabend 1975, 114; 1981a,
238), nor one that requires translation into a neutral observation
language. Different epistemic values, such as universality, accuracy,
simplicity, fruitfulness may pull in different directions allowing for
rational disagreement (cf. Hoyningen-Huene 1992, 492&ndash;496; 1993,
150&ndash;154; cf. Feyerabend 1981a, 16; 1981c, 238). But even given
that a full point-by-point comparison of incommensurable theories is
impossible and that theory comparison does not have the status of a
proof, a comparative evaluation of incommensurable theories is still
possible (cf. Hoyningen-Huene 1993, 236&ndash;258; Carrier 2001) and
rational in a means/ends or instrumental sense. For example, according
to Kuhn it is rational to choose theories that are better
problem-solvers because they better serve the ends of science. This
property of theory choice makes the overall process of science both
rational and progressive. With incommensurability, Kuhn was not
challenging the rationality of theory choice, he was trying to make
room for the possibility of rational disagreement between proponents
of competing paradigms. In fact, according to Kuhn,
&ldquo;incommensurability is far from being the threat to rational
evaluation of truth claims that it has frequently seemed. Rather,
it&rsquo;s what is needed, within a developmental perspective, to
restore some badly needed bite to the whole notion of cognitive
evaluation. It is needed, that is, to defend notions like truth and
knowledge from, for example, the excesses of post-modernist movements
like the strong program&rdquo; (2000 [1991], 91).</p>

<p>
The extent of the misreading of incommensurability as implying
incomparability is even more dramatic in Feyerabend&rsquo;s case.
Feyerabend explicitly and repeatedly argued that developing
incommensurable rivals offers a <em>better</em> means of testing
established theories than merely testing them directly against their
own predictions or by developing commensurable alternatives
(Feyerabend 1962, 66; cf. Oberheim 2006, 235ff.). They offer a better
means of testing because some observations can <em>only</em> be
interpreted as refutations of an existing theory after an
incommensurable alternative has been developed with which to interpret
them (cf. Oberheim 2006, 240&ndash;245, Oberheim 2024). The
misunderstanding that incommensurability implies incomparability
conflates testability with falsifiability, as can be seen in
Popper&rsquo;s <em>The Myth of the Framework</em> (1994). However,
Feyerabend was not arguing that universal theories are untestable. He
was arguing that they are not falsifiable. He argues that because two
incommensurable theories use <em>qualitatively</em> incompatible
concepts to interpret <em>quantitatively</em> identical results, they
will interpret the same quantitative sentences as different
qualitative statements, concluding: &ldquo;there may not exist any
possibility of finding a <em>characterization</em> of the observations
which are supposed to confirm two incommensurable theories&rdquo;
(1962, 94, italics inserted). This precludes the possibility of using
a <em>neutral</em> observation language (such as Popperian basic
statements) for comparing the empirical consequences of rival
incommensurable theories by establishing formal relations between them
and their corresponding predictions. However, Feyerabend did not
conclude from this that they cannot be compared empirically, but
rather that there is no need for a <em>neutral</em> observation
language to establish formal relations for an empirical comparison,
illustrating how with the example of Einstein&rsquo;s prediction of
the stochastic character of Brownian motion. Feyerabend also mentions
other possibilities of comparing incommensurable theories and
recognizes &lsquo;methodological incommensurability&rsquo;, although
he did not call it that (Feyerabend 1965b, 217; 1970, 228; 1975, 284;
1978, 68; 1981a, 16).</p>

<p>
Finally, there is a central, substantive point of agreement between
Kuhn and Feyerabend that should be emphasized. Both see
incommensurability as excluding the possibility of interpreting
scientific development as an approximation to truth (or as an
&ldquo;increase of verisimilitude&rdquo;) (Feyerabend 1965c, 107;
1970, 220, 222, 227&ndash;228; 1975, 30, 284; 1978, 68; Kuhn 1970,
206; 2000 [1991], 95; 2000 [1993], 243ff.; cf. Oberheim 2006, 180ff.;
Oberheim 2024; Hoyningen-Huene 1993, 262&ndash;264). They reject such
characterizations of scientific progress because they recognize that
scientific revolutions result in changes to what we experience as
real. In scientific revolutions, such changes cannot be just mere
refinements of, or additions to, the established theory, such that
these developments could be seen as cumulative additions. Rather, the
new ontology <em>replaces</em> its predecessor. Consequently, neither
Kuhn nor Feyerabend can correctly be characterized as a scientific
realist who believes that science makes progress toward truth.</p>

<h1>Darwinism</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Aug 13, 2004; substantive revision Mon May 6, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Darwinism designates a distinctive form of evolutionary explanation
for the history and diversity of life on earth. Its original
formulation is provided in the first edition of <em>On the Origin of
Species</em> in 1859. This entry first formulates
&lsquo;Darwin&rsquo;s Darwinism&rsquo; in terms of six philosophically
distinctive themes: (i) probability and chance, (ii) the nature, power
and scope of selection, (iii) adaptation and teleology, (iv) the
interpretation of the concept of &lsquo;species&rsquo;, (v) the tempo
and mode of evolutionary change, and (vi) the role of altruism and
group selection in the explanation of morality. Both Darwin and his
critics recognized that his approach to evolution was distinctive on
each of these topics, and it remains true that, though Darwinism has
developed in many ways unforeseen by Darwin, its proponents and
critics continue to differentiate it from other approaches in
evolutionary biology by focusing on these themes. This point is
illustrated in the second half of the entry by looking at current
debates in the philosophy of evolutionary biology on these six
themes.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="Intr">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
Scientific theories are historical entities. Often you can identify
key individuals and documents that are the sources of new
theories&mdash;Einstein&rsquo;s 1905 papers, Copernicus&rsquo; 1539
<em>De Revolutionibus</em>, Darwin&rsquo;s <em>On the Origin of
Species</em>. Sometimes, but not always, the theory tends in popular
parlance to be named after the author of these seminal documents, as
is the case with Darwinism.</p>

<p>
But like every historical entity, theories undergo change through
time. Indeed a scientific theory might undergo such significant
changes that the <em>only</em> point of continuing to name it after
its source is to identify its lineage and ancestry. This is decidedly
<em>not</em> the case with Darwinism. As Jean Gayon has put it:</p>

<blockquote>
The Darwin-Darwinism relation is in certain respects a causal
relation, in the sense that Darwin influenced the debates that
followed him. But there is also something more: a kind of isomorphism
between Darwin&rsquo;s Darwinism and historical Darwinism. It is as
though Darwin&rsquo;s own contribution has constrained the conceptual
and empirical development of evolutionary biology ever after. (Gayon
2003, 241)
</blockquote>

<p>
Darwinism identifies a core set of concepts, principles and
methodological maxims that were first articulated and defended by
Charles Darwin and which continue to be identified with a certain
approach to evolutionary
 questions.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 We will thus need to begin with Darwin&rsquo;s Darwinism as
articulated in <em>On the Origin of Species</em> in 1859. We will then
examine these same themes as they have been discussed by evolutionary
biologists and philosophers of biology from the beginnings of the
Neo-Darwinian Synthesis to the present.</p>

<p>
Charles Darwin was not, as we use the term today, a philosopher,
though he was often so described during his
 lifetime.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 Nevertheless, for an encyclopedia of philosophy what is needed is a
discussion of the impact of philosophy on Darwin&rsquo;s Darwinism,
and the impact of Darwin&rsquo;s Darwinism on topics that both he, and
we, would consider philosophical. We focus here on the impact of
philosophical discussions about the nature of science during
Darwin&rsquo;s lifetime on Darwin&rsquo;s scientific research,
thinking and writing; and on the impact of that research, thinking and
writing on philosophy. Taking the time to do such philosophical
archaeology stems from a conviction that if the concept of Darwinism
has legitimate application today, it is due to a set of principles,
both scientific and philosophical, that were articulated by Darwin and
that are still widely shared by those who call themselves
&lsquo;Darwinians&rsquo; or &lsquo;neo-Darwinians&rsquo;.</p>

<h2 id="DarwDarw">2. Darwin and Darwinism</h2>

<h3 id="DarwLife">2.1 Darwin&rsquo;s Life</h3>

<p>
Charles Darwin was born February 12, 1809 and died April 18, 1882. It
was a time of radical changes in British culture, and his family
background put him in the midst of those changes. His grandfather,
Erasmus Darwin, was a prosperous and highly respected physician living
in Western England, south of Birmingham. He was also a philosophical
radical, advocating Enlightenment ideas about human equality and
liberty, including the liberty to think freely about the existence of
God and about natural origins for the earth&rsquo;s creatures. He
wrote a number of very popular works of natural history, some in
verse, in which he defended views about progress that included
evolutionary speculations about the upward progress of living things
from primordial beginnings.</p>

<p>
Erasmus Darwin was an early member of an informal group of free
thinkers self-styled the Lunar
 Society,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 that met regularly in Birmingham to discuss everything from the
latest philosophical and scientific ideas to the latest advances in
technology and industry. The Society included James Watt, Joseph
Priestley and Charles Darwin&rsquo;s other grandfather, Josiah
Wedgwood. Wedgwood, like Erasmus Darwin, lived in Staffordshire and
was in the process of developing a family pottery works into a major
industrial concern by applying new scientific and technological ideas
to the production of &lsquo;china&rsquo;. The religious inclinations
of the group were &lsquo;non-conforming&rsquo; and included a number
of Unitarians, a sect Erasmus Darwin referred to as &lsquo;a
featherbed to catch a falling Christian&rsquo;. Looked upon with
suspicion by High Church conservatives, they actively promoted in
Great Britain the revolutionary philosophical, scientific and
political ideas sweeping across Europe and the Americas. Most had
spent considerable time absorbing Enlightenment ideas in Edinburgh,
Scotland.</p>

<p>
Under the circumstances, it is not surprising that Robert Darwin,
Charles&rsquo; father, should follow in his father&rsquo;s footsteps
and become a doctor, nor that he should end up marrying Susannah
Wedgwood, by all reports Josiah&rsquo;s favorite offspring.
Politically and philosophically engaged, Susannah worked to organize
her children&rsquo;s education in the town of Shrewsbury, where she
and Robert took up residence. She sent her children to a day school
operated by Unitarian minister Rev. George Case and this is where
Charles began his education. Unfortunately, Susannah died in 1817 when
Charles was only 8, and his father then transferred him to the
Shrewsbury School, operated by Dr. Samuel Butler, grandfather of the
novelist (and sometime satirist of Darwin&rsquo;s work) of the same
name. &ldquo;Nothing could have been worse for the development of my
mind than Dr. Butler&rsquo;s school&rdquo; Charles proclaimed in the
autobiography he wrote for his family, and he escaped down the street
to his home whenever he could.</p>

<p>
His older siblings took good care of him, under the Doctor&rsquo;s
watchful eye. Early letters indicate that he and his brother Erasmus
were enthusiastic amateur chemists, and after his brother went up to
Cambridge their letters were often full of possible experiments,
orders to purchase chemicals and equipment for their
&lsquo;laboratory&rsquo;, and discussions of the latest discoveries.
This was an obvious enough passion that his classmates nicknamed him
&lsquo;Gas&rsquo;. During summers he helped his father on his rounds
to his patients, and when only 16 his father sent him and his brother
to Edinburgh for the best medical education Great Britain had to
offer. Erasmus needed to move from Cambridge to a proper medical
school to complete his medical education, and young Charles was taken
out of Shrewsbury School early to accompany his brother to Edinburgh,
apparently being prepared to follow in his father&rsquo;s and
grandfather&rsquo;s footsteps in medicine. The two brothers arrived in
Edinburgh in October of 1825. Erasmus left after the first year,
leaving his brother on his own during his second year at
Edinburgh.</p>

<p>
Privately, Darwin early on decided he could not practice medicine. But
his already serious inclination toward science was considerably
strengthened at Edinburgh both by some fine scientific lectures in
chemistry, geology and anatomy and by the mentoring of Dr. Robert
Grant. Grant certainly knew that young Charles was Erasmus
Darwin&rsquo;s grandson; Grant expounded evolutionary ideas derived
from Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Charles&rsquo; grandfather. But his
primary gift to Charles was introducing him to marine invertebrate
anatomy and the use of the microscope as a scientific tool and as an
aid to dissecting extremely small creatures dredged out of the Firth
of Forth. Darwin joined an Edinburgh scientific society, the Plinean
society, of which Grant was a prominent member, and presented two
lectures that reported discoveries he had made while working with
Grant. This interest in marine invertebrates was to be a life long
obsession, climaxing in his massive four-volume contribution to the
comparative anatomy and systematics of fossil and living Cirripedia or
&lsquo;barnacles&rsquo; (Barrett &amp; Freeman 1988, vols.
11&ndash;13).</p>

<p>
When he finally broke the news of his distaste for medicine to his
father, he enrolled to take a degree in Divinity at Christ College,
Cambridge University, from which he graduated in January of 1831. As
with the Shrewsbury School and Edinburgh, his official course of study
had very little impact on him, but while in Cambridge he befriended
two young men attempting to institute serious reforms in the natural
science curriculum at Cambridge, Rev. John Henslow, trained in botany
and mineralogy, and Rev. Adam Sedgwick, a leading member of the
rapidly expanding community of geologists. Henslow and his wife
treated Darwin almost as a son, and through Henslow Darwin was
introduced to the men whose ideas were currently being debated in
geology and natural history, as well as to men whom we look back on as
among the very first to take up the historical and philosophical
foundations of science as a distinct discipline, Sir John Herschel and
Rev. William Whewell. As he wrote in his autobiography:</p>

<blockquote>
During my last year at Cambridge, I read with care and profound
interest Humboldt&rsquo;s <em>Personal Narrative</em>. This work, and
Sir J. Herschel&rsquo;s <em>Introduction to the Study of Natural
 Philosophy</em>,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 stirred up in me a burning zeal to add even the most humble
contribution to the noble structure of Natural Science. No one or a
dozen other books influenced me nearly so much as these two.
</blockquote>

<p>
In the next section we will discuss the influence of the philosophical
ideals of Herschel and Lyell on Darwin.</p>

<p>
Furthering his scientific training, Adam Sedgwick on two occasions
took Darwin on extended geological tours of England and Wales. In
addition Darwin and a cousin, William Darwin Fox, a year ahead of him
at Cambridge, developed what began as an amateur passion for bug
collecting into serious entomology.</p>

<h3 id="DarwDarw_1">2.2 Darwin&rsquo;s Darwinism</h3>

<p>
His Edinburgh and Cambridge mentors were to shape Darwin&rsquo;s
philosophical attitudes and scientific career decisively. It was
Henslow who was the final link to Darwin in a chain connected to
Captain Robert Fitzroy of H. M. S. Beagle. Fitzroy sought a gentleman
companion who could also collect information on geology and natural
history during a proposed circumnavigation of the globe.
Henslow&rsquo;s note to Darwin, asking if he would be interested in
being recommended for this post, arrived at the Darwin home,
&lsquo;the Mount&rsquo;, while Charles Darwin was on a geological
survey of Northern Wales with Adam Sedgwick. After resistance from his
father had been overcome, Darwin was offered the post and accepted
it.</p>

<p>
The combination of meticulous field observation, collection and
experimentation, note taking, reading and thinking during what turned
into the Beagle&rsquo;s five year journey through a very wide
cross-section of the earth&rsquo;s environments was to set the course
for the rest of his life. During the voyage he read and reread Charles
Lyell&rsquo;s newly published <em>Principles of Geology</em>, a
three-volume work that articulated a philosophical vision of
rigorously empirical historical science, oriented around five key
ideas:</p>

<ol>

<li>The geologist investigates both the animate and inanimate changes
that have taken place during the earth&rsquo;s history.</li>

<li>His principal tasks are to develop an accurate and comprehensive
record of those changes, to encapsulate that knowledge in general
laws, and to search for their causes.</li>

<li>This search must be limited to causes that can be studied
empirically&mdash;those &lsquo;now in operation&rsquo;, as Lyell puts
it in the sub-title of his <em>Principles</em>, on the assumption that
they have always operated, into the deep past, at the same intensity
at which they now operate.</li>

<li>The records or &lsquo;monuments&rsquo; of the earth&rsquo;s past
indicate a constant process of the &lsquo;introduction&rsquo; and
&lsquo;extinction&rsquo; of species, and it is the geologist&rsquo;s
task to search for the causes of these introductions and extinctions,
according to the strictures note in 3., above.</li>

<li>The only serious attempt to do so according to the idea that
species are capable of &lsquo;indefinite modification&rsquo;, that of
Jean Baptiste Lamarck, is a failure on methodological grounds. All the
evidence supports the view that species variability is limited, and
that one species cannot be transformed into another.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This vision influenced Darwin profoundly, as he freely admitted. While
he became convinced by his observations and reading that the fossil
record and current distribution of species could only be due to the
gradual transformation of one species into another, he was determined
to articulate a theory that measured up to Lyell&rsquo;s principles.
The crucial event in convincing him that this was to be his
life&rsquo;s work was likely a visit to Cape Town, South Africa during
the Beagle&rsquo;s return trip to England. John F. W. Herschel was in
Cape Town on a mission to do for the Southern Hemisphere what his
father William had done for the Northern, namely to develop a
comprehensive star map with the new powerful telescopes developed by
his father and aunt. As noted earlier, Darwin had been deeply
impressed by Herschel&rsquo;s <em>Preliminary Discourse on the Study
of Natural Philosophy</em> when it first appeared a year before the
Beagle set sail, and in his private journal he referred to his
meetings with Herschel during a week long stop in Cape Town in June of
1836 as among the most profound events of the entire voyage. Just five
months before meeting Darwin, Herschel had finished reading the
2<sup>nd</sup> edition of Lyell&rsquo;s <em>Principles</em>. He sent
Lyell a long letter filled with detailed constructive commentary. The
letter opens by praising Lyell for facing the issue of the
&lsquo;introduction of new species&rsquo;&mdash;which Herschel calls
&lsquo;that mystery of mysteries&rsquo;&mdash;scientifically, and for
advocating that we search for &lsquo;intermediate causes&rsquo; to
explain these &lsquo;introductions&rsquo;&mdash;code for natural, as
opposed to &lsquo;miraculous&rsquo;,
 causes.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
 This part of the letter was quoted in Charles Babbage&rsquo;s
<em>Bridgewater Treatise</em>, published in 1837 while Darwin was
struggling to develop just such a theory. Upon reading the Herschel
quotation in Babbage, Darwin wrote in his private
&lsquo;species&rsquo; notebooks:</p>

<blockquote>
Babbage 2d Edit, p. 226.&mdash;Herschel calls the appearance of new
species. the mystery of mysteries. &amp; has grand passage upon
problem.! Hurrah.&mdash;&ldquo;intermediate causes&rdquo;. (Barrett et
al., 1987, 413; original punctuation)
</blockquote>

<p>
He clearly recognizes that Herschel is here providing a philosophical
justification for the project upon which Darwin was secretly working.
And, in the very first paragraph of <em>On the Origin of Species</em>,
Darwin looks back to this &lsquo;Hurrah&rsquo;, attributing the idea
that the origin of species is &lsquo;that mystery of mysteries&rsquo;
to &lsquo;one of our greatest philosophers&rsquo;, without mentioning
Herschel by name. The first mention of the possibility of an
evolutionary solution to this problem is in his <em>Ornithological
Notebooks</em>, in a note written shortly after departing Cape
 Town.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Darwin&rsquo;s theoretical task was, by the time he opened his species
notebooks, tolerably clear: the only process that could produce the
systematic patterns in the fossil record and the otherwise strange
biogeographic distribution of species he now understood so widely and
deeply was a process of slow, gradual transformation of species. He
needed to come up with a natural, causal theory that would account for
such transformations, and every element of that theory had to identify
&lsquo;causes now in operation&rsquo;, causes that could be
investigated empirically. The problem, and the methodological
constraints, had been advocated by his geological hero, and now close
friend, Charles Lyell; and they had been defended philosophically by
his philosophical hero, Sir John Herschel.</p>

<p>
Darwin, of course, expected, and got, outraged reactions from
religiously conservative colleagues, such as his old geology teacher
Sedgwick, who in a review expressed his &ldquo;deep aversion to the
theory; because of its unflinching materialism;&ndash;because it has
deserted the inductive track,&ndash;the only track that leads to
physical truth;&ndash;because it utterly repudiates final causes, and
therby [sic] indicates a demoralized understanding on the part of its
advocates.&rdquo; What he had not expected was Lyell&rsquo;s refusal
to openly endorse his theory and Herschel&rsquo;s decisive (if polite)
rejection of its key elements. After we set out the theory in its
Darwinian form, we can consider these reactions from those who
apparently shared Darwin&rsquo;s philosophical norms about scientific
theory, explanation and confirmation.</p>

<p>
The theory can be set out as a series of causal elements that, working
together, will produce the needed transformations.</p>

<ol>

<li>Species are comprised of individuals that vary ever so slightly
from each other with respect to their many traits.</li>

<li>Species have a tendency to increase in numbers over generations at
a geometric rate.</li>

<li>This tendency is checked, to use the language of Thomas
Malthus&rsquo; <em>On the Principle of Population</em>, by limited
resources, disease, predation, and so on, creating a struggle for
existence among the members of a species.</li>

<li>Some individuals will have variations that give them a slight
advantage in this struggle, variations that allow more efficient or
better access to resources, greater resistance to disease, greater
success at avoiding predation, and so on.</li>

<li>These individuals will tend to survive better and leave more
offspring.</li>

<li>Offspring tend to inherit the variations of their parents.</li>

<li>Therefore favorable variations will tend to be passed on more
frequently than others and thus be preserved, a tendency Darwin
labeled &lsquo;Natural Selection&rsquo;.</li>

<li>Over time, especially in a slowly changing environment, this
process will cause the character of species to change.</li>

<li>Given a long enough period of time, the descendant populations of
an ancestor species will differ enough both from it and each other to
be classified as different species, a process capable of indefinite
iteration. There are, in addition, forces that encourage
<em>divergence</em> among descendant populations, and the elimination
of intermediate varieties.</li>
</ol>

<p>
It will be noticed that there is no element of this theory that is
incapable of empirical investigation&mdash;indeed by now the published
confirmatory studies of this process would fill a small
 library.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 One can understand why devout and orthodox Christians would have
problems; but why Darwin&rsquo;s philosophical and scientific mentors?
It would seem to be the model of Herschelian/Lyellian orthodoxy.</p>

<h3 id="PhilProbDarwDarw">2.3 Philosophical Problems with Darwin&rsquo;s Darwinism</h3>

<p>
The answer lies in six philosophically problematic elements of the
theory.</p>

<h4>2.3.1 Probability and Chance</h4>

<p>
First, notice the use of the language of &lsquo;tendencies&rsquo; and
&lsquo;frequencies&rsquo; in the above principles. Privately, Darwin
learned, Herschel had referred to his theory as &lsquo;the Law of
higgledy-piggledy&rsquo;, presumably a reference to the large element
played in its key principles by chance and probability. Darwin&rsquo;s
theory is, as we would say today, a &lsquo;statistical&rsquo; theory.
One cannot say that every individual with favorable variation
<em>v</em> will survive or will leave more offspring than individuals
without it; one cannot say that no environment will ever support all
of the offspring produced in a given generation, and thus that there
<em>must</em> <em>always</em> be a competitive struggle. These are
things that <em>tend</em> to happen due to clearly articulated causes,
and this allows us to make accurate predictions about <em>trends</em>,
at the level of populations, but not to make absolute claims about
what must happen in each and every case. Only well after
Herschel&rsquo;s time did philosophers of science become comfortable
with the idea of a theory of this sort, and the proper philosophical
understanding of such explanations is still debated.</p>

<h4>2.3.2 The Nature, Power and Scope of Selection</h4>

<p>
The core of Darwin&rsquo;s theory is the concept of natural selection.
Perhaps because of his use of the term selection, this core element of
his theory apparently baffled nearly everyone. Could it be, as Lyell,
Herschel and Darwin&rsquo;s great American defender Asa Gray would
ask, an &lsquo;intermediate cause&rsquo;, i.e. a causal principle
instituted and sustained by God? Or is it, in its very nature, the
antithesis of such a principle, as his old geology teacher Sedgwick
believed? Could it possibly create species, or is it, by its nature, a
negative force, eliminating what has already been created by other
means? In one of his copies of <em>On the Origin of Species</em>,
Alfred Russell Wallace crosses out &lsquo;natural selection&rsquo; and
writes &lsquo;survival of the fittest&rsquo; next to it. Wallace
always felt that &lsquo;selection&rsquo; inappropriately imported
anthropomorphic notions of Nature choosing purposefully between
variants into natural history. And, in a devastating review, Fleeming
Jenkin happily accepted the principle of natural selection but
challenged its power to modify an ancestral species into descendent
species, and thus limited its scope to the production of varieties. A
number of reviewers, even some sympathetic ones, questioned the
possibility of extending the theory to account for the evolution of
those characteristics that differentiate humans from their nearest
relatives.</p>

<h4>2.3.3 Selection, Adaptation and Teleology</h4>

<p>
Moreover, because Darwin was very fond of describing natural selection
as a process that worked for the good of each species, Darwin&rsquo;s
followers seemed to have diametrically opposed views as to whether his
theory eliminated final causes from natural science or breathed new
life into them. In either case, there was also serious disagreement on
whether this was a good thing or a bad
 thing.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h4>2.3.4 Species and the Concept of &lsquo;Species&rsquo;</h4>

<p>
There is a fundamental philosophical problem with the idea that a
species can undergo a series of changes that will cause it to become
one or more other species. To illustrate it, look carefully at the
first question that Charles Lyell wishes to address in the second
volume of the <em>Principles of Geology</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
&hellip;first, whether species have a real and permanent existence in
nature; or whether they are capable, as some naturalists pretend, of
being indefinitely modified in the course of a long series of
generations. (Lyell 1831, II. 1)
</blockquote>

<p>
Lyell pretty clearly assumes that to allow for evolution is to deny
the reality of species. For a species to be &lsquo;real&rsquo;, it
must have &lsquo;permanent existence in nature&rsquo;, or as he puts
it elsewhere , &ldquo;&hellip;fixed limits beyond which the
descendants from common parents can never deviate from a certain
type&hellip;&rdquo;. (Lyell 1831, II. 23) To accept evolutionary
change, on this view, you must become comfortable with a variety of
nominalism about species. And Darwin seems to have become
 so.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup></p>
 
<blockquote>
Hence I look at individual differences, though of small interest to
the systematist, as of high importance for us, as being the first step
towards such slight varieties as are barely thought worth recording in
works on natural history. And I look at varieties which are in any
degree more distinct and permanent, as steps leading to more strongly
marked and more permanent varieties; and at these latter, as leading
to sub-species, and to species. (Darwin 1859, 52)
</blockquote>

<p>
Permanence, as applied to species, is for Darwin a relative concept,
and there are no fixed limits to variability within a species. Given
enough time the individual differences found in all populations can
give rise to more permanent and stable varieties, these to
sub-species, and these to populations that systematists will want to
class as distinct species. Moreover, he concludes the <em>Origin</em>
with very strong words on this topic, words bound to alarm his
philosophical readers:</p>

<blockquote>
Systematists will be able to pursue their labours as at present; but
they will not be incessantly haunted by the shadowy doubt whether this
or that form be in essence a species. &hellip;In short, we will have
to treat species in the same manner as those naturalists treat genera,
who admit that genera are merely artificial combinations made for
convenience. This may not be a cheering prospect; but we shall at
least be freed from the vain search for the undiscovered and
undiscoverable essence of the term species. (Darwin 1859, 485)
</blockquote>

<p>
Lyell, Herschel, Whewell, Sedgwick and many of Darwin&rsquo;s
contemporaries certainly would not find this a cheering prospect,
since they were unrepentant realists about
 species.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>
 Members of a species possess a &lsquo;type&rsquo; established in the
original parents, and this type provides &lsquo;fixed limits&rsquo; to
variability. Lyell clearly feels this is an empirically verifiable
fact&mdash;most of chapters 2&ndash;4 of <em>Principles</em> Vol. II
is devoted to presenting the evidence that such &lsquo;fixed
limits&rsquo; exist; and after the <em>Origin&rsquo;s</em> publication
this evidence was canvassed again in Fleeming Jenkin&rsquo;s review.
If this is so, then species extinction is easy to account
for&mdash;there are fixed limits to a species&rsquo; ability to track
environmental change. But a naturalistic account of species
origination is more difficult, since there will need to be, in
sexually reproducing species, a natural production of a new pair of
parents with a new type. On the other hand, to adopt the sort of
nominalism that Darwin seems to be advocating in the above quotations
has undesirable consequences as
 well.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup>
 How are we to formulate objective principles of classification? What
sort of a science of animals and plants will be possible if there are
no fixed laws relating their natures to their characteristics and
behaviors? A good deal of chapter 2 of Darwin&rsquo;s <em>Origin</em>
is devoted to convincing the reader that current best practice among
botanists and zoologists accepts a natural world organized as he is
insisting rather than as his opponents claim:</p>

<blockquote>
It must be admitted that many forms, considered by highly competent
judges as varieties, have so perfectly the character of species that
they are ranked by other highly competent judges as good and true
species. (Darwin 1859, 49)
</blockquote>

<p>
From a Darwinian perspective, this is a predictable consequence of the
fact that the organisms we today wish to classify as species are
merely the most recent stage of a slow, gradual evolutionary process.
Organisms within a genus have common ancestors, perhaps relatively
recent common ancestors; some naturalists may see ten species with a
few varieties in each; others may rank some of the varieties as
species and divide the same genus into twenty species. Both
classifications may be done with the utmost objectivity and care by
skilled observers. As systematists like to say, some of us are
&lsquo;lumpers&rsquo;, some of us are &lsquo;splitters&rsquo;. Reality
is neither.</p>

<h4>2.3.5 Tempo and Mode of Evolutionary Change</h4>

<p>
The question of nominalism versus realism regarding species points
toward a final aspect of Darwin&rsquo;s theory with which many of
those otherwise sympathetic to him disagreed, his gradualism. For
apart from the question of whether his views entailed
&lsquo;nominalism&rsquo; about natural kinds, they do seem to reflect
a belief that the evolutionary process must be a slow and gradual one.
It is perhaps here that we see the most lasting impact of
Darwin&rsquo;s careful study of Charles Lyell&rsquo;s <em>Principles
of Geology</em> while on H.M.S. Beagle. We stress slow <em>and</em>
gradual, for it is clear that one could have a <em>slow but
non-gradual</em> evolutionary process (perhaps the long periods of
evolutionary stasis punctuated by geologically rapid periods of
speciation postulated by Eldridge and Gould&rsquo;s &lsquo;punctuated
equilibrium model&rsquo; is such); and one could have a <em>rapid but
gradual</em> one (for example the process George Gaylord Simpson
labeled &lsquo;adaptive radiation&rsquo;, where a population migrates
to a location with a variety of unexploited niches, and rapidly
evolves to exploit them). Darwin stresses over and over again that he
conceives of natural selection &lsquo;adding up infinitely small
variations&rsquo;, and that he imagines the process of speciation to
take place over a very long period of time.</p>

<h4>2.3.6 Evolutionary Ethics, Altruism, and Group Selection</h4>

<p>
Despite Darwin&rsquo;s effort to eschew discussion of human beings in
the <em>Origin</em> (famously writing only that &ldquo;light will be
thrown on the origin of man and his history&rdquo;; Darwin 1859, 488),
he clearly believed that an evolutionary account of the human
&ldquo;moral sense&rdquo;&mdash;as Darwin described it, borrowing from
James Mackintosh&mdash;could be offered. This account, as a
sub-species of what we now would call (though Darwin did not use these
terms) altruistic behavior in general (see the entry for
 <a href="../altruism-biological/">biological altruism</a>),
 quickly brought Darwin into contact with a host of difficult
problems.</p>

<p>
In the <em>Descent of Man</em>, he flirted with an explanation of the
moral sense in terms of the characteristics not of moral individuals,
who would seem to fare less well in the struggle for existence than
their egoistic compatriots, but in terms of the characteristics of
groups exhibiting moral virtues. In a case of struggle between two
tribes of &ldquo;primeval man,&rdquo; he writes, the one with &ldquo;a
greater number of courageous, sympathetic, and faithful members, who
were always ready to warn each other of danger, to aid and defend each
other, this tribe would without doubt succeed best and conquer the
other&rdquo; (Darwin 1871, 1:162). Whether this involves a genuine
appeal to what contemporary scholars would call &ldquo;group
selection&rdquo; (see the entry on
 <a href="../selection-units/">units and levels of selection</a>),
 or whether this can be described solely in terms of individuals
desiring to help themselves and their relatives (i.e., in terms of kin
selection) remains the subject of much discussion.</p>

<p>
One of the strongest arguments for insisting that
&lsquo;Darwinism&rsquo; as it is used today is isomorphic to
Darwin&rsquo;s Darwinism, as Gayon puts it, is that each of these
questions is still hotly debated, and has been throughout the
theory&rsquo;s history. With all of the amazing changes that have been
wrought by the genetic, biochemical, and molecular revolutions, with
the development of mathematical models of population genetics and
ecology, of sophisticated techniques for both field and laboratory
investigation of evolutionary processes, and of cladistic analysis in
systematics, it nevertheless remains true that one can find
evolutionary biologists who adhere to Darwin&rsquo;s Darwinism, and
are recognized as doing so by both themselves and their critics. In
the next section of this article, we will develop a portrait of
contemporary Darwinism around each of these contested features.</p>

<p>
By the same token, however, Darwinism has evolved. As one example of
this truth, think for a moment of contemporary debates about the
nature of selection. The problems people had with natural selection in
the 19<sup>th</sup> century continue to be problematic, but there are
a variety of problems that were either not discussed, or discussed
very differently, in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Can, and does,
natural selection work at levels other than the level of
Darwin&rsquo;s focus, individual organisms; is there a non-vacuous way
to formulate the theory abstractly; how are we to understand the
relationships between the concepts of fitness, selection and
adaptation? How strong are the constraints on the selection process,
and what sorts of constraints are there? Are there other motors of
evolutionary change besides selection, and if so, how important are
they?</p>

<h2 id="SixCorePhilProbToda">3. The Six Core Philosophical Problems Today</h2>

<blockquote>
Theories need both essences and histories.
<br />
Stephen Jay Gould (2002, 1)
</blockquote>

<p>
So reads the heading of the very first section of the first chapter of
Gould&rsquo;s monumental <em>The Structure of Evolutionary
Theory</em>. Opening with a subtle reading of an exchange of letters
in 1863 between paleontologist Hugh Falconer and Charles Darwin, Gould
eventually explains what he has in mind by this section heading:</p>

<blockquote>
In short, &ldquo;The structure of evolutionary theory&rdquo; combines
enough stability for coherence with enough change to keep any keen
mind in a perpetual mode of search and challenge. (Gould 2002, 6)
</blockquote>

<p>
Gould, of course, was both an unabashed admirer of Charles Darwin and
one of the most outspoken critics of the &lsquo;neo-Darwinian
synthesis&rsquo;. We will be using both his account of &lsquo;the
Essence of Darwinism&rsquo; in Part I of this magnum opus and his
arguments for a &lsquo;Revised and Expanded Evolutionary Theory&rsquo;
in its Part II as touchstones and targets.</p>

<p>
In the preceding section of this essay, we organized our discussion of
the problems that Darwin&rsquo;s allies had with
<em>Darwin&rsquo;s</em> Darwinism around six issues: [i] the role of
chance as a factor in evolutionary theory and the theory&rsquo;s
apparently probabilistic nature; [ii] the nature of selection; [iii]
the question of whether selection/adaptation explanations are
teleological; [iv] the ontological status of species and the
epistemological status of species concepts; [v] the implications of
Darwin&rsquo;s insistence on the slow and gradual nature of
evolutionary change; and [vi] the impact of natural selection on
ethics and altruistic behavior. We claimed that one very good reason
for continuing to characterize one dominant approach to evolutionary
biology, that represented by the so-called &lsquo;Neo-Darwinian
Synthesis&rsquo;, as &lsquo;Darwinism&rsquo; is that its proponents
side with Darwin on these issues, to the extent that Darwin had a
clear position on them (and on many less fundamental ones besides).
That in itself is remarkable, but it is the more so because the
Darwinian position on each of these issues is under as much pressure
from non-Darwinian evolutionary biologists today as it was in the wake
of the <em>Origin</em>. It is not surprising, given the situation as
we have just characterized it, that historians and philosophers of
biology have made significant contributions to the discussion,
especially in pointing out the underlying philosophical issues and
conceptual confusions and ambiguities that stand in the way of
resolving the issues at hand, and their historical origins.</p>

<p>
It is our conviction that a full understanding of the underlying
philosophical disagreements on these questions will only come from a
patient historical study of how the &lsquo;Synthesis&rsquo; positions
on these various issues, and those of their critics, arose. That we
cannot do here. Rather, in what follows we will simply be presupposing
certain answers to these questions of historical origins. The list of
references at the end of this essay includes a number of excellent
pieces of work on this subject for those who share our convictions
about its importance.</p>

<h3 id="RoleChanEvolTheo">3.1 The Roles of Chance in Evolutionary Theory</h3>

<p>
Let us begin with the language Darwin uses when he first sketches his
theory at the beginning of the fourth chapter of the
<em>Origin</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
Can it, then, be thought <em>improbable</em>, seeing that variations
useful to man have undoubtedly occurred, that other variations useful
in some way to each being in the great and complex battle of life,
should <em>sometimes</em> occur in the course of thousands of
generations? If such do occur, can we doubt (remembering that many
more individuals are born than can possibly survive) that individuals
having any advantage, however slight, over others, would have <em>the
best chance</em> of surviving and of procreating their kind? (Darwin
1859, 80&ndash;81, emphasis added)
</blockquote>

<p>
Unlike Darwin&rsquo;s contemporaries, and despite Darwin&rsquo;s own
apparent hesitation, the founders of the synthesis of Mendelian
genetics and Darwinian selection theory, Sewall Wright, Ronald Fisher
and J. B. S. Haldane, were entirely comfortable with a selection
theory formulated in such terms. This was a substantial shift in the
presentation of evolution, from a reluctantly probabilistic picture to
a thoroughly mathematized, statistical, and probabilistic theory,
which occurred in the first several decades after the publication of
the <em>Origin</em> (Gayon 1998; Pence 2022).</p>

<p>
On this issue, contemporary Darwinism has adopted an approach every
bit as &lsquo;chancy&rsquo; as that of Darwin. Note one clear
statement of the <em>Principle of Natural Selection</em> from the
philosophical literature:</p>

<blockquote>
If <em>a</em> is better adapted than <em>b</em> to their mutual
environment <em>E</em>, then (probably) <em>a</em> will have greater
reproductive success than <em>b</em> in <em>E</em>. (Brandon 1990,
11).
</blockquote>

<p>
The theory trades pervasively in probabilities. Given the fact that
evolutionary biologists, especially in so far as they take their cues
from population genetics, deal with large populations conceived as
&lsquo;gene pools&rsquo;, and think of evolution as long run changes
in the frequencies of different combinations of genes from generation
to generation, it is clear that, in the sense of making use of
probabilistic or statistical reasoning, chance permeates contemporary
Darwinism. The models of population biology provide a means of
assigning probabilities to various outcomes, given information about
population size, rates of mutation and migration (themselves given as
averages and estimates). That is, as Darwin notes, being relatively
better adapted increases an organism&rsquo;s &lsquo;chances&rsquo;,
i.e. increases its probability, of leaving viable offspring. It does
not guarantee it. Since natural selection is a stochastic process,
Darwinians from Darwin to the present rightly characterize it in terms
of influencing the &lsquo;chances&rsquo; of a given outcome, given
variables such as selection pressure, population size or mutation
rates.</p>

<p>
Conceptual confusion arises, however, from the fact that
&lsquo;chance&rsquo; and &lsquo;randomness&rsquo; are often
contrasted, not with &lsquo;deterministic&rsquo; or
&rsquo;non-probabilistic&rsquo; outcomes, but with
&lsquo;selected&rsquo; outcomes. The evolutionary process, as Darwin
understood it, involves both the <em>generation</em> of variation and
a process producing a differential <em>perpetuation</em> of variation.
One way to think about chance in Darwinism is in relation to a logical
space of alternatives, by means of the following <em>variation
grid</em>:</p>

<table class="avoid-break cellpad-med-dense centered two-hrules vert-top">
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td class="center" colspan="3"><em>Variations</em></td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td><em>Generation</em></td>
  <td><em>Perpetuation</em></td> </tr>
<tr class="rule-above">
  <td><em>Fitness Biased</em></td>
  <td>Lamarck
<br />
Asa Gray</td>
  <td>Darwin
<br />
Asa Gray</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td><em>Not Fitness Based</em></td>
  <td>Darwin
<br />
Neutralism</td>
  <td>Lamarck
<br />
Neutralism</td> </tr> </tbody>
</table>

<p>
On this second sense of chance, what seems to make a theory
&lsquo;chancy&rsquo; is the fact that <em>generation</em> of variation
and <em>perpetuation</em> of variation have both been, for some of
these theorists, independent of future utility or fitness. As we see
from the grid, a contrast on both scores is found in the evolutionary
philosophy of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. Lamarck&rsquo;s is a
<em>materialistic</em> argument against the variation in nature being
a matter of chance. On the Lamarckian view, variations arise in an
organism as a direct response to environmental stress or demand,
giving rise to a stimulus, which in turn elicits a physiological
response, which finally can be passed on via reproduction to
offspring. Variations are not chance or random, since they are an
appropriate response to an environmental stress. Here
&lsquo;chance&rsquo; signals a <em>lack of relation or connection to
adaptive needs</em>.</p>

<p>
The concept of &lsquo;random variation&rsquo; is today often used as a
synonym for &lsquo;chance variation&rsquo; in precisely this latter
sense. Here are two examples of this notion of chance or randomness as
used by contemporary Darwinians.</p>

<blockquote>
&hellip;mutation is a random process with respect to the adaptive
needs of the species. Therefore, mutation alone, uncontrolled by
natural selection, would result in the breakdown and eventual
extinction of life, not in adaptive or progressive evolution.
(Dobzhansky 1970, 65)
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus the production of variations may be a &lsquo;chance&rsquo;
process in that there are a number of possible outcomes with
assignable probabilities, but it is <em>also</em> a
&lsquo;chance&rsquo; process in the sense that the probability
assignments are not biased by &lsquo;adaptive needs&rsquo; or
&lsquo;fitness&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Referring now to perpetuation rather than generation of variation,
when John Beatty describes &lsquo;random drift&rsquo; as
&lsquo;changes in frequencies of variations due to chance&rsquo; in
the following passage, he presumably has something like a contrast
with changes in frequencies due to selection in mind.</p>

<blockquote>
In Darwin&rsquo;s scheme of things, recall, chance events and natural
selection were consecutive rather than alternative stages of the
evolutionary process. There was no question as to which was more
important at a particular stage. But now that we have the concept of
random drift taking over where random variation leaves off, we are
faced with just such a question. That is, given chance variations, are
further changes in the frequencies of those variations more a matter
of chance or more a matter of natural selection? (Beatty 1984, 196)
</blockquote>

<p>
Notice that in the above quote we first get a substitution of
&lsquo;random&rsquo; for &lsquo;chance&rsquo; in the phrases
&lsquo;random variation&rsquo; and &lsquo;chance variation&rsquo;, and
then at least the suggestion that the concept of &lsquo;random
drift&rsquo; can be characterized as &lsquo;changes in frequencies of
variations due to chance&rsquo;, where the contrast class consists of
similar changes due to natural selection.</p>

<p>
With respect to the <em>generation</em> of variation, chapter 5 of
<em>On the Origin of Species</em> opens with the following
apology:</p>

<blockquote>
I have hitherto sometimes spoken as if the variations&mdash;so common
and multiform in organic beings under domestication, and in a lesser
degree in those in a state of nature&mdash;had been due to chance.
This, of course, is a wholly incorrect expression, but it serves to
acknowledge plainly our ignorance of the cause of each particular
variation. (Darwin 1859, 131)
</blockquote>

<p>
Here Darwin is noting that, though to speak of &lsquo;chance
variations&rsquo; may seem to be citing chance as the cause of the
variations, in fact it is simply acknowledging that they &lsquo;appear
to have no assignable cause&rsquo;. But it is important to keep
historical context in mind here. Whether Darwin himself ever flirted
with the idea of &lsquo;directed&rsquo; variation or not, he was
acutely aware of two views from which his needed to be distinguished,
very different from each other, but both holding to the view that
variations arose for a
 purpose.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>
 The most widely shared alternative was that found in natural
theology. To quote the Reverend William Paley&rsquo;s <em>Natural
Theology</em>, regarding a beautiful instance of adaptation: &ldquo;A
conformation so happy was not the gift of chance&rdquo;. Likewise,
among Darwin&rsquo;s followers, the American botanist Asa Gray, in an
essay entitled &lsquo;Natural Selection and Natural Theology&rsquo;,
uses the same contrast to advise Darwin against the notion of
&lsquo;chance variation&rsquo;: &ldquo;&hellip;we should advise Mr.
Darwin to assume, in the philosophy of his hypothesis, that variation
has been led along certain beneficial lines.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Gray is here insisting that, since Darwin admits that using the term
&lsquo;chance&rsquo; merely signals ignorance of the true cause, and
since the pervasive adaptations in nature suggest design, Darwin
should avoid the suggestion that <em>variations are due to chance in
the sense of &lsquo;absence of design&rsquo;</em>. This introduces yet
a third sense of &lsquo;chance&rsquo; that has been instrumental in
the interpretation of evolutionary theory (Shanahan 1991, 264).</p>

<p>
Darwin, in fact never refers to &lsquo;chance variations&rsquo; in the
<em>Origin</em>, though occasionally he will note that if a beneficial
variation &lsquo;chances [i.e. happens] to appear&rsquo;, it will be
favored by selection (see pp. 37, 82) What Darwin has in mind,
however, is clear from his concluding remarks in his chapter on
<em>Laws of Variation</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
Whatever the cause may be of each slight difference in the offspring
from their parents&mdash;and a cause of each must exist&mdash;it is
the steady accumulation, through natural selection, of such
differences, when beneficial to the individual, that gives rise to all
the more important modifications of structure&hellip; (Darwin 1859,
170)
</blockquote>

<p>
Whatever the cause of the <em>generation</em> of a variation may be,
the role of selection is to <em>accumulate</em> those already present
variations that happen to be beneficial, a process that, while
probabilistic, is not at all independent of fitness (and hence not
&lsquo;chancy&rsquo; in our second sense). As Beatty put it, the
generation of variations and their selection are
&lsquo;consecutive&rsquo; processes. But to call the generation of
variation a &lsquo;chance&rsquo; process is to use
&lsquo;chance&rsquo; in either the second or the third sense, meaning
either that such generation is independent of the future utility of
variations for the organism, or that it is <em>not</em> by design,
<em>not</em> for some end.</p>

<p>
There are, therefore, at least three forms of &lsquo;chance&rsquo; at
play in contemporary evolutionary theory: an invocation of
probabilistic or statistical inferences, an invocation of processes
that act independently of current or future fitness, and an invocation
of the absence of design. To these we might add, as mentioned above,
chance as ignorance of causes, and chance as historical contingency,
though we lack the space to discuss either of those notions further
here, bringing the total to five (see, e.g., Shanahan 1991,
263&ndash;267). Eble (1999, 76) drops the notion of probabilistic or
statistical inference and adds the idea, less relevant in evolutionary
contexts, that &lsquo;chance&rsquo; can refer to uncaused events (see
analysis in Millstein 2000, 609&ndash;613).</p>

<p>
One further example can illustrate how all this interacts in the
broader context of contemporary evolutionary theory (for more such
examples, see the contributions to Ramsey and Pence 2016). Here, a
champion of the neutral theory of molecular evolution characterizes
his position:</p>

<blockquote>
&hellip;the great majority of evolutionary changes at the molecular
(DNA) level do not result from Darwinian natural selection acting on
advantageous mutants but, rather, from random fixation of selectively
neutral or very nearly neutral mutants through random genetic drift,
which is caused by random sampling of gametes in finite populations.
(Kimura 1992, 225)
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, it will be noticed, the focus is not on the <em>generation</em>
of variations but on the <em>perpetuation</em> of variations. The
contrast is between a random sampling of gametes that leads to the
fixation of selectively neutral alleles and natural selection favoring
advantageous variations. That is, the contrast between
&lsquo;chance&rsquo; and &lsquo;fitness biased&rsquo; processes is now
being used to distinguish different <em>means of perpetuating certain
variations</em>. We are contrasting two sampling processes. Drift
samples without concern for adaptation; selection samples
discriminately on the basis of differences in fitness. Both samplings
are &lsquo;probabilistic&rsquo;, of course, but that in no way
obviates the above contrast.</p>

<p>
However, as Beatty has pointed out, it was quite common until fairly
recently to characterize natural selection in such a way as to make it
almost indistinguishable from random drift (cf. Lennox 1992, Lennox
and Wilson 1994). Numerous accounts of fitness characterized the
fitness of a genotype as defined by its relative contribution to the
gene pool of future generations&mdash;the genotype contributing the
larger percentage being the fitter. But of course that could easily be
the result of a &lsquo;random&rsquo;&mdash;non-fitness
biased&mdash;sampling process; which organisms would be declared
&lsquo;fitter&rsquo; by this method might have nothing to do with
natural selection. In order to provide a proper characterization of
the role of chance in evolutionary change, then, it is critical to
provide a more robust and sophisticated account of fitness. (For
further information, see the entry on
 <a href="../fitness/">fitness</a>.)
 This, in turn, requires that we discuss the conceptual network that
includes the notions of adaptation and natural selection, to which we
will turn shortly.</p>

<p>
For now, let us assume that there is a way of characterizing fitness
such that there is a substantial empirical question of what role
indiscriminate sampling of genotypes (or phenotypes) plays in
evolutionary change. This issue was first placed squarely before
evolutionary biologists by Sewall Wright in the early 1930s. As Wright
pointed out, genes that are neutral with respect to fitness can, due
to the stochastic nature of any process of sampling from a population,
increase their representation from one generation to the next. The
likelihood of this happening goes up as effective population size goes
down. Since Wright imagined that a quite typical scenario in
evolutionary change was for species to be broken up into relatively
small, relatively isolated, populations (or &lsquo;demes&rsquo;), with
significantly more breeding within than between demes, the likelihood
that such &lsquo;neutral genotypes&rsquo; could become fixed at
relatively high levels was significant. Though he gradually toned down
this aspect of his work, a significant school of mathematical
population geneticists in the 1960s and 70s took these ideas and ran
with them, developing a &lsquo;Neutralist&rsquo; approach to
evolutionary change. This is the position characterized by Kimura (one
of its most eloquent defenders) in the passage quoted above. Whether
or not such a process plays a significant role in evolution is not a
philosophical issue, but it is highly relevant to whether evolutionary
biology should be seen as predominantly Darwinian. For if any view is
central to Darwinism, it is that the evolutionary process is
predominantly guided by the fitness-biasing force of natural
selection, acting on variations that arise by chance. It is to natural
selection and related concepts that we now turn.</p>

<h3 id="NatuPoweScopSele">3.2 The Nature, Power and Scope of Selection</h3>

<blockquote>
The greatest number of females will, of course, fall to the share of
the most vigorous males; and the strongest individuals of both sexes,
by driving away the weakest, will enjoy the best food, and the most
favourable situations, for themselves and for their offspring. A
severe winter, or a scarcity of food, by destroying the weak and the
unhealthy, has had all the good effects of the most skilful selection.
</blockquote>

<p>
The words of Charles Darwin? No; these are the words of John Sebright,
penned in <em>The Art of Improving the Breeds of Domestic Animals</em>
in 1809, the year of Charles Darwin&rsquo;s birth and fifty years
before <em>On the Origin of Species</em> was published. Darwin refers
to this passage in Notebook C of his Species
 Notebooks.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup>
 It will be noticed that Sebright is <em>not</em> discussing domestic
selection, but is quite clearly saying that processes leading to
differential survival and reproduction in nature will have &lsquo;all
the good effects of the most skilful selection&rsquo;. Darwin, then,
did not need to read Malthus to see what is here so plainly and
clearly stated&mdash;namely, that the struggle for survival in nature
will have the same &lsquo;selective&rsquo; effects as the actions of
the domestic breeder of plants and animals.</p>

<p>
As this passage, and the argument of the <em>Origin</em>, shows,
&lsquo;natural selection&rsquo; began life as the product of
analogical reasoning. Sebright sees clearly that the natural processes
he is describing will have the same <em>effects</em> as the
breeder&rsquo;s selection, but he is not about to describe those
processes as selection processes. Darwin took that step, and Darwinism
has followed.</p>

<p>
Darwin himself consistently refers to natural selection as a <em>power
of preserving</em> advantageous, and eliminating harmful, variations.
As noted in the last section, whether a particular variation is
advantageous or harmful is, in once sense of that term, a matter of
chance; and whether an advantageous variation is actually preserved by
selection is, in another sense of the term, also a matter of chance.
For Darwinism, selection is the force or power that biases survival
and reproduction in favor of advantageous variations, or to look ahead
to the next section, of adaptations. It is this that distinguishes
selection from drift.</p>

<p>
Recent years have seen significant challenges to the idea that this
framework is sufficient to explain all evolutionary phenomena, or even
to explain an important fraction of evolutionary phenomena of
interest. On one side we find partisans of the so-called
&ldquo;extended evolutionary synthesis&rdquo; (EES), who argue that
features like niche construction, developmental bias, phenotypic
plasticity, and non-genetic inheritance entail the existence of a
theory that at least radically supplements, if not transcends
entirely, the Darwinian perspective (for an introduction, see Laland
et al. 2014; further references include Pigliucci and M&uuml;ller
2010; Uller and Laland 2019). On the other side we could put scholars
like George C. Williams, who has vigorously defended the explanatory
sufficiency of <em>Darwinian selection theory</em> (Williams 1992), or
a number of proposals arguing that sufficiently reformulated concepts
from &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; evolutionary theory can allow it to
take on the challenge of the EES without radical changes (e.g., the
gene for Lu and Bourrat 2017, or adaptationism for Welch 2017; see
also the entries on the
 <a href="../gene/">gene</a>,
 <a href="../adaptationism/">adaptationism</a>, and
 <a href="../population-genetics/">population genetics</a>).</p>
 
<p>
We can distinguish two broad categories into which we might sort these
non-Darwinian amendments: [i] proposed <em>limitations</em> on natural
selection as an evolutionary force; and [ii] <em>expansions</em> of
the scope of natural selection to include new &lsquo;targets&rsquo;,
&lsquo;processes&rsquo; or &lsquo;mechanisms&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;levels&rsquo;. It will be noted that in neither case is it
obvious that the theory <em>itself</em> requires modification in the
face of such challenges&mdash;in principle these might be nothing more
than challenges to the theory&rsquo;s <em>range of application</em>.
However, if it turned out that <em>most</em> evolutionary change could
be explained without recourse to natural selection, this would be
grounds for arguing that evolutionary biology was no longer Darwinian.
And if it turned out that the theory of natural selection could
<em>only</em> be integrated with our new understanding of the
processes of inheritance and development by a wholesale modification
of its foundations, it might be best to see the new theory as a
modified descendent of Darwinism, rather than Darwinism itself.
Theories may need essences, as Gould claims; but if what is
fundamental to the theory has changed, then so has its essence. To
borrow a phrase from Paul Griffiths, perhaps it is not that theories
need histories <em>and</em> essences&mdash;perhaps what they need are
<em>historical essences</em>.</p>

<p>
Alfred Russell Wallace regularly urged Darwin to jettison the term
&lsquo;selection&rsquo; as misleadingly anthropomorphic, and
substitute Herbert Spencer&rsquo;s &lsquo;survival of the
fittest&rsquo;. Darwin went halfway&mdash;in later editions he added
&lsquo;or Survival of the Fittest&rsquo; to &lsquo;Natural
Selection&rsquo; in the title of chapter 4. As the theory developed in
the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, the expression &lsquo;survival of the
fittest&rsquo; was gradually eliminated from any serious presentation
of Darwinian selection theory. On the other hand, the concept of
&lsquo;fitness&rsquo; has played a prominent, and problematic, role.
In the mathematical models used in population genetics,
&lsquo;fitness&rsquo; refers either to the abilities of the different
genotypes in a population to leave descendants, or to the measures of
those abilities, represented by the variable <em>W</em>. Here is a
rather standard textbook presentation of the relevant concepts:</p>

<blockquote>
In the neo-Darwinian approach to natural selection that incorporates
consideration of genetics, fitness is attributed to particular
genotypes. The genotype that leaves the most descendants is ascribed
the fitness value <em>W</em>=1, and all other genotypes have
fitnesses, relative to this, that are less than 1. &hellip; Fitness
measures the relative evolutionary advantage of one genotype over
another, but it is often important also to measure the relative
penalties incurred by different genotypes subject to natural
selection. This relative penalty is the corollary of fitness and is
referred to by the term <em>selection coefficient</em>. It is given
the symbol <em>s</em> and is simply calculated by subtracting the
fitness from 1, so that: <em>s</em> = 1 &minus; <em>W</em>. (Skelton
1993, 164)
</blockquote>

<p>
The problem lies in the fact that the concept of fitness plays dual
roles that are instructively conflated in this quotation. For when
fitnesses are viewed as measures of differential <em>abilities</em> of
organisms with different genotypes to leave different numbers of
offspring, the language of fitness encourages us to suppose that
&lsquo;fitness&rsquo; refers to the relative selective advantages of
genotypes. On the other hand, if &lsquo;fitness&rsquo; simply refers
to the <em>measure</em> of reproductive success, it is a quantitative
representation of small scale evolutionary change in a population, and
leaves entirely open the question of the <em>causes</em> of the
change. But then the assumed connections among the concepts of
fitness, adaptation and natural selection are severed.
&lsquo;Selection coefficients&rsquo; may have nothing to do with
selection; what <em>W</em> represents may have nothing to do with
selective advantage.</p>

<p>
There is, however, a way of formulating the theory in its modern guise
which maintains an essentially Darwinian character. Since there are a
number of confirmed ways in which natural populations can evolve in
the absence of natural selection, and since balancing selection, i.e.
countervailing selection forces, may prevent a population from
evolving in its presence, it is clear that establishing, by measuring
different reproductive rates among its members, that the genetic
make-up of a population has changed does not establish that natural
selection was the source of that change; nor does the fact that no
change has been measured establish that natural selection is not
operative. Population genetics and its associated models should be
treated as the &lsquo;kinematics&rsquo;, not the
&lsquo;dynamics&rsquo; of evolutionary processes (on this distinction,
see also Pence 2021). That is, it is a way of establishing that a
population either is or is not in equilibrium, and it provides
sophisticated tools for measuring rates of change in a population
across generations. Moreover, like the kinematics of any physical
theory, if it establishes cross-generational change, it also tells us
that there are causes to be found&mdash;the detailed contours of those
measures may even provide suggestions as to where to look for those
causes. What it cannot do <em>on its own</em> is provide knowledge of
the forces at work. To use language introduced by Elliott Sober,
fitness, unlike natural selection, is <em>causally inert</em>. (For
further information, see the entry on
 <a href="../population-genetics/">population genetics</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
That means that, as valuable as population genetics is, it should not
be equated with the theory of natural selection. Too often in both
biological presentations of the theory and philosophical discussions
of it, this is forgotten. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
Most people are familiar with the basic theory of natural selection.
Organisms vary in a heritable fashion. Some variants leave more
offspring than others; their characteristics, therefore, are
represented at a greater frequency in the next generation. (Wilson
1984, 273)
</blockquote>

<p>
This is a presentation of &lsquo;the basic theory of natural
selection&rsquo; that makes no reference to natural selection at
all!</p>

<p>
Natural selection, if it is to resemble the Darwinian concept that
bears that name, must be reserved for reference to an <em>interaction
between a variable, heritable feature of an organic system and the
environment of that system</em>. That interaction may or may not
change the proportions of those features across generations, and those
proportions may change for reasons other than those interactions. But
a plausible natural selection hypothesis must posit some such
interaction. (Whether this interaction is accurately described as
causal is another much-debated topic in recent years; see Pence 2021
for a high-level summary.) On this issue we will give the last word to
Stephen Jay Gould:</p>

<blockquote>
&hellip;when we consider natural selection as a causal process, we can
only wonder why so many people confused a need for measuring the
results of natural selection by counting the differential increase of
some hereditary attribute (bookkeeping) with the mechanism that
produces relative reproductive success (causality). (Gould 2003, 619)
</blockquote>

<p>
The concept of natural selection has to this point been presented
broadly because of the other two critical questions surrounding the
contemporary Darwinian concept of natural selection that we mentioned
earlier&mdash;questions having to do with possible limiting
constraints on natural selection and about the sorts of objects that
can be viewed as appropriate organismic/environmental
&lsquo;interactors&rsquo; in the selection process.</p>

<p>
If we suppose that for Darwin natural selection was almost exclusively
thought of as an interaction between individual organisms and their
organic and inorganic environments, then we can see two challenges to
Darwinism today with respect to <em>levels</em> of selection. There
are those, such as G. C. Williams, Richard Dawkins (1976) and, more
recently, J. Arvid &Aring;gren (2021), who argue that selection is
always and only of genes. Here is a clear statement:</p>

<blockquote>
These complications [those introduced by organism/environment
interactions] are best handled by regarding individual [organismic]
selection, not as a level of selection in addition to that of the
gene, but as the primary mechanism of selection at the genic level.
(Williams 1993, 16)
</blockquote>

<p>
Dawkins&rsquo; preferred mode for making the same point is to refer to
organisms&mdash;or interactors&mdash;as the <em>vehicles</em> of their
genes, in fact vehicles constructed by the genome for its own
perpetuation.</p>

<p>
The original impulse for this approach, especially clear in
Williams&rsquo; classic <em>Adaptation and Natural Selection</em>
(1966), was philosophical&mdash;it was to use a sort of Ockham&rsquo;s
razor strategy against group selection hypotheses, showing that
alleged group selection effects could be explained by explanations
operating at the level of the genome (an approach more recently taken
by the controversial Nowak et al. 2010). Throughout that book,
selection is always said to be of individual alleles, regardless of
the role environments at various levels may play in the process.</p>

<p>
This view has been extensively challenged by philosophers of biology
on both methodological and conceptual grounds, though there are, among
philosophers, enthusiastic supporters (cf. Dennett 1995). In all the
give and take, it is seldom noticed that defenders of this view claim
to be carrying the Darwinian flag (Gayon 1998 and Gould 2003 are
exceptions). Yet it is certainly <em>not</em> a position that Darwin
would recognize&mdash;and not merely because he lacked a coherent
theory of the units of inheritance. It is not a Darwinian view because
for Darwin it was differences in the abilities of organisms at various
stages of development to respond to the challenges of life that had
causal primacy in the explanation of evolutionary change. Among
evolutionary biologists from the &lsquo;neo-Darwinian synthesis&rsquo;
on, it is those who stress the role of organisms in populations
interacting differentially to ever-variable ecological conditions in
causing changes in the gene pools of those populations who are the
card-carrying Darwinians. Such a &ldquo;return of the organism&rdquo;
(Nicholson 2014) in evolutionary explanations marks a profound link
between proponents of an extended evolutionary synthesis (e.g., Walsh
2015) and Darwin himself.</p>

<p>
Darwinism also has challenges from the opposite direction. In the
1970s a number of biologists working in the fields of paleontology and
systematics challenged the Neo-Darwinian dogma that you could account
for &lsquo;macro-evolution&rsquo; by means of long term extrapolation
from micro-evolution. Gould, in particular, opens Part II of <em>The
Structure of Evolutionary Theory</em> (<em>Towards a Revised and
Expanded Evolutionary Theory</em>), with a chapter entitled
&lsquo;Species as Individuals in the Hierarchical Theory of
Selection&rsquo;. That chapter title combines two conceptually
distinct theses that connect debates about the fundamentals of natural
selection to patterns in macroevolution: first, the thesis defended by
Michael Ghiselin (Ghiselin 1997) and championed and refined by David
Hull (Hull 2001), that species are, in a robust sense of the term,
&lsquo;individuals&rsquo;; and second, that there may well be
selection among groups of organisms, <em>qua</em> groups (see
 <a href="#EvolEthiAltrGrouSele">section 3.6</a>).
 These debates over the importance of selective and non-selective
processes and the relationship between these mechanisms of biological
change and broader patterns of diversification and adaptation comprise
some of the most important and heated discussions currently underway
in evolutionary theory.</p>

<h3 id="SeleAdapTele">3.3 Selection, Adaptation and Teleology</h3>

<p>
Early in the Introduction to <em>On the Origin of Species</em>, Darwin
observes that the conclusion that each species had descended from
others &ldquo;even if well founded, would be unsatisfactory, until it
could be shown how the innumerable species inhabiting this world have
been modified so as to acquire that perfection of structure and
co-adaptation which most justly excites our admiration&rdquo; (Darwin
1859, 3). One might say this was the central promise of
Darwinism&mdash;to account for both phylogenic continuity <em>and</em>
adaptive differentiation by means of the same principles; or as Darwin
puts it, to integrate in one theory the supposed opposition between
Unity of Type and Conditions of Existence.</p>

<p>
But it is here that even the most sympathetic of Darwin&rsquo;s
theistic supporters were forced to qualify their support for the
theory of descent with modification by means of natural selection. In
Darwin&rsquo;s day the reactions of Asa Gray and John Herschel are
perhaps the most interesting in this respect. Both men saw in
Darwin&rsquo;s theory a way to account for &lsquo;that mystery of
mysteries,&rsquo; the regular appearance of new species by means of
natural, or as they might say, &lsquo;intermediate&rsquo; causes.
However both instinctively recoiled from the irreducible and central
role of &lsquo;chance&rsquo; in the theory. They did not, but easily
could have, said &lsquo;God does not play dice with the
universe.&rsquo; But as Darwin stated repeatedly, if gently, to
Gray&mdash;if God ordained that variations should be along beneficial
lines, natural selection would be redundant. Moreover, the evidence
from the study of variation in domestic and natural populations put
the lie to any claim that God directs all or most variation along
beneficial lines. Darwinian selection theory is a two-step
process&mdash;the production of variation unrelated to the adaptive
requirements of the organism, and differential perpetuation of those
variations that serve adaptive needs. Again, a theory of evolution
that could not be so described would not be a Darwinian theory.</p>

<p>
The nature of &lsquo;selection explanations&rsquo; is a topic to which
much philosophical attention has been devoted in recent years. Here we
want to focus on only one important question&mdash;to what extent is
the teleological appearance of such explanations simply that, an
appearance masking a causal process in which goals play no role?</p>

<p>
The <em>appearance</em> of teleology is certainly present in Darwinian
explanations, and has been since Darwin spoke of natural selection
<em>working solely for the good</em> of each being. The appearance of
teleology stems from the ease with which both evolutionary biology and
common sense take it for granted that animals and plants have the
adaptations they do <em>because</em> of some benefit or advantage to
the organism provided by those adaptations.</p>

<p>
This is a hotly contested question, and we will here simply sketch a
case that selective explanations of adaptations are robustly
teleological. The interested reader may want to refer to the
literature on this question referred to in the discussion and listed
in the list of readings provided at the end of this entry. The serious
philosophical issue can be put simply and directly: in selection
explanations of adaptations, are the functions served by adaptations a
central and irreducible feature of the explanans in such explanations?
If the answer is yes, the explanations are
 teleological.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
A good place to begin is with a simple, yet realistic, example. In
research carried out over many years and combining painstaking field
work and laboratory experimentation, John Endler was able to
demonstrate that the color patterns of males in the guppy populations
he was studying in rivers feeding into the southern Caribbean were a
consequence of a balance between mate selection and predator
selection. To take one startling example, he was able to test and
confirm a hypothesis that a group of males, with a color pattern that
matched that of the pebbles on the bottoms of the streams and ponds
they populated except for bright red spots, have that pattern because
a common predator in those populations, a prawn, is color blind for
red. Red spots did not put their possessors at a selective
disadvantage, and were attractors for mates (Endler 1983,
173&ndash;190). We may refer to this pattern of coloration as a
complex adaptation that serves the functions of predator avoidance and
mate attraction. But what role do those functions play in explaining
why it is that the males in this population have the coloration they
do?</p>

<p>
This color pattern is an adaptation, as that term is used in
Darwinism, only if it is a product of natural selection (Williams
1966, 261; Brandon 1985; Burian 1983). In order for this to be true,
there must be an array of color variation available in the
genetic/developmental resources of the species wider than this
particular pattern but including this pattern. Which factors are
critical, then, in producing differential survival and reproduction of
guppies with this particular pattern? The answer would seem to be the
value-consequences this pattern has compared to others available in
promoting viability and reproduction. In popular parlance (and the
parlance favored by Darwin), this color pattern is <em>good for</em>
the male guppies that have it, and for their male offspring, and that
is why they have it (Binswanger 1990; Brandon 1985; Lennox 2002). This
answer strengthens the &lsquo;selected effects&rsquo; or
&lsquo;consequence etiology&rsquo; accounts of selection explanations
by stressing that selection ranges over <em>value</em> differences.
The reason for one among a number of color patterns having a higher
fitness value has to do with the <em>value</em> of that pattern
<em>relative to the survival and reproductive success</em> of its
possessors.</p>

<p>
Selection explanations are, then, a particular kind of teleological
explanation, an explanation in which <em>that for the sake of
which</em> a trait is possessed, <em>its valuable consequence</em>,
accounts for the trait&rsquo;s differential perpetuation and
maintenance in the population.</p>

<h3 id="SpecConcSpec">3.4 Species and the Concept of &lsquo;Species&rsquo;</h3>

<p>
In listing the topics we would discuss under the heading of
neo-Darwinism, we distinguished the question of the ontological status
of species from the epistemological status of the species
<em>concept</em>. Though they are closely related questions, it is
important to keep them distinct. As will become clear as we proceed,
this distinction is rarely honored. Moreover, it is equally important
to distinguish the <em>species concept</em> from the categories of
features that belong in a definition of species (Rheins 2011).
Advances in our theoretical understanding may lead us to reconsider
the sorts of attributes that are most important for determining
whether a group of organisms is a species, and thus whether it
deserves to be assigned a name at that taxonomic level. It should not
be assumed that such changes constitute a change in the species
concept, though at least some such changes may lead us to restrict or
expand the range of taxa that are designated as species. In his
contribution to the Neo-Darwinian Synthesis, <em>Systematics and the
Origin of Species</em>, Ernst Mayr titled chapter five &lsquo;The
Systematic Categories and the New Species Concept&rsquo;. Recall that
Darwin made a point of treating the species category as continuous
with &lsquo;well-marked variety&rsquo; and &lsquo;sub-species&rsquo;,
and made the radical suggestion that its boundaries would be just as
fluid. Without explicitly acknowledging Darwin, Mayr takes the same
tack, discussing &lsquo;individual variants&rsquo; and
&lsquo;sub-species&rsquo; as a preliminary to discussing the species
concept. Mayr notes that for someone studying the evolutionary
process, speciation is a critical juncture; &ldquo;&hellip;his
interpretation of the speciation process depends largely on what he
considers to be the final stage of this process, the species.&rdquo;
(Mayr 1942/1982, 113) With this in mind, he offers the following
definition, the so-called &lsquo;biological species concept&rsquo;
(BSC):</p>

<blockquote>
<em>Species are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding
natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such
groups</em> (Mayr 1942/1982, 120; 1976, 518)
</blockquote>

<p>
Mayr was well aware of the limitations of this definition, and treated
it somewhat as a &lsquo;regulative ideal&rsquo;. Dobzhansky in 1937
gave what he claimed to be a definition of species, but which seems,
as Mayr noted (Mayr 1976, 481), much more a definition of
<em>speciation</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
&hellip;that stage of evolutionary process, &ldquo;at which the once
actually or potentially interbreeding array of forms becomes
segregated in two or more separate arrays which are physiologically
incapable of interbreeding.&rdquo; (312)
</blockquote>

<p>
Simpson (1943) and others built even more historicity into the
concept. These are all, of course, intended as <em>definitions</em> of
the species <em>category</em>, and they attempt to provide a test (or
a &lsquo;yardstick&rsquo;: Mayr 1976, 479) that in principle will
permit a researcher to decide whether a group of individuals should
all be identified by a single species-level concept such as
&lsquo;homo sapiens&rsquo;. The test for species membership is the
<em>capacity</em> to interbreed; the test distinguishing two species
is <em>incapacity</em> to interbreed. Dobzhansky makes the importance
of this test transparent&mdash;the transition from a single
interbreeding population to two reproductively isolated ones is the
process of speciation.</p>

<p>
Now in each of these definitions, little attention is paid to the
actual methods used by taxonomists and systematists in differentiating
between varieties of a species and distinct species, something to
which Darwin gave a great deal of attention. Darwin&rsquo;s apparent
nominalism regarding the species concept likely stemmed from his close
attention to his own taxonomic practices and those of other
specialists.</p>

<p>
Mayr, on the contrary, relates different approaches to the species
concept to the philosophical distinction between essentialism and
nominalism (for the history of this argumentative move, see Witteveen
2015; 2016). He associates what he calls essentialism (and what we
called above &ldquo;realism&rdquo; about species) with the view that a
species <em>concept</em> refers to a universal or type. This view of
the referent of the concept leads to the Typological Species Concept,
which he traces from Linnaeus back to Plato and Aristotle, and which
he claims &lsquo;is now universally abandoned&rsquo; (1976, 516). It
is worth noting that serious doubt has been cast both on the
historical and the philosophical credentials of Mayr&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Typological Species Concept&rsquo; (see, e.g. Lennox, 1987;
repr. in Lennox 2001b; Winsor 2001, 2006; Walsh 2006; Wilkins 2009).
At the opposite extreme is nominalism, which combines the view that
only individuals exist in nature and that species are concepts
invented for the purpose of grouping these individuals
collectively.</p>

<p>
Mayr claims that his Biological Species Concept (BSC) is an advance on
both; individual species members are objectively related to one
another not by a shared relation to a type but by causal and
historical relationships to one another. He can thus be understood as
arguing for a new, objective way of understanding the epistemological
grounds for grouping individuals into species. This new way of
grouping stresses historical, genetic and various ecological
relationships among the individuals as the grounds for determining
species membership. His claim is that this is more reliable and
objective than similarities of phenotypic characteristics. This makes
sense of the importance he eventually places on the fact the BSC
defines species relationally:</p>

<blockquote>
&hellip;species are relationally defined. The word species corresponds
very closely to other relational terms such as, for instance, the word
<em>brother</em>. &hellip; To be a different species is not a matter
of degree of difference but of relational distinctness. (Mayr 1976,
518)
</blockquote>

<p>
Mayr has in mind that brothers may or may not look alike; the question
of whether two people are brothers is determined by their historical
and genetic ties to a common ancestry. Notice, however, that this is a
claim about which characteristics, among the many that they have,
should be taken most seriously in determining the applicability to
them of the concept &lsquo;brother&rsquo;. That is, it is a defense of
a sort of essentialism.</p>

<p>
A number of critics have pointed out that essentialism need not be
committed to &lsquo;types&rsquo; understood as <em>universalia in
re</em>; and on certain accounts of essences any species taxon that
meets the standards of BSC does so in virtue of certain essential
(though relational and historical) properties. At one extreme, Michael
Ghiselin and David Hull have argued that this causal/historical
structure of species provides grounds, at least within evolutionary
biology, for considering species to be
 individuals.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup>
 Organisms are not members of a class or set, but &lsquo;parts&rsquo;
of a phylogenetic unit. Taking a very different tack, Denis Walsh has
recently argued that a form of &lsquo;evolutionary
essentialism,&rsquo; bearing a striking resemblance to the
essentialism of Aristotle&rsquo;s zoological work, is implicit in the
work of a number of evolutionary developmental theorists (Walsh,
2006).</p>

<p>
A critical issue in this debate over the account of the species
concept most appropriate for Darwinism is the extent to which the
process of biological classification&mdash;taxonomy&mdash;should be
informed by advances in biological theory. Besides those already
discussed, the moderate pluralism associated with Robert Brandon and
Brent Mischler or the more radical pluralism defended by Philip
Kitcher, argues that different explanatory aims within the biological
sciences will require different criteria for determining whether a
group constitutes a species (perhaps, controversially, including
non-epistemic value commitments; see Garnett and Christidis 2017;
Conix 2019). Cladists, on the other hand, employ strictly defined
phylogenetic tests to determine species rank (see Rheins 2011).</p>

<p>
Unlike many of the other topics that define the history of Darwinism,
there is no clear-cut position on this question that can be identified
as &lsquo;Darwinian&rsquo; or &lsquo;neo-Darwinian&rsquo;. In a recent
collection of papers defending most of the alternatives currently
being advanced (Ereshefsky 1992), our suspicion is that virtually
every author in that collection would identify himself as Darwinian.
This may be because, as different as they are, a number of positions
currently being defended have their roots in Darwin&rsquo;s own theory
and practice (see Beatty 1985; reprinted in Ereshefsky 1992).</p>

<h3 id="TempModeEvolChan">3.5 Tempo and Mode of Evolutionary Change</h3>

<p>
Contemporary debates over the tempo and mode of evolutionary change
often travel with those concerning the role of
&ldquo;non-Darwinian&rdquo; processes in evolutionary biology, as
discussed in
 <a href="#NatuPoweScopSele">section 3.2</a>.
 As was argued above, the classical Darwinist position on questions of
tempo and mode is usually taken to be a strict gradualism, with
natural selection slowly pushing populations toward adaptive peaks
(see the entry on
 <a href="../adaptationism/">adaptationism</a>).
 From Darwin&rsquo;s day to our own, a number of processes other than
natural selection that significantly impact the speed and direction of
population change have been increasingly emphasized. The oldest among
them was
 <a href="../genetic-drift/">genetic drift</a>,
 which draws our attention toward selectively neutral (sometimes, as
we saw above, described as &ldquo;random&rdquo;) change in
populations. If one emphasizes processes of this sort, evolution might
still be gradual, but it would not necessarily, or even not usually,
be adaptively directed.</p>

<p>
The same is true for the increasing interaction between
 <a href="../evolution-development/">evolution and developmental biology</a>,
 or evo-devo. If processes like phenotypic plasticity, in which an
organism with a static genotype may exhibit radically different
phenotypes as a developmental response to environmental influences,
are extremely prevalent, then the kind of gradual walk toward an
adaptive peak which it is clear Darwin had in mind would be regularly
punctuated by fits and starts of various kinds, as new portions of
evolutionary space became available as a result of developmental
novelty. In turn, this could lead to the non-gradual (potentially even
non-Darwinian) pattern of <em>punctuated equilibrium</em>, Stephen Jay
Gould&rsquo;s term for this oscillation between periods of stasis and
rapid change across the history of the tree of life (see the entry on
 <a href="../macroevolution/">macroevolution</a>).
 Examples of this sort could be multiplied (e.g., biased mutation,
epigenetics), though we lack the space to do so here.</p>

<p>
To be sure, it is not clear that Darwin himself would have considered
any of these to be &ldquo;anti-Darwinian&rdquo; approaches. As
counter-examples to Darwin&rsquo;s gradualism accumulated in his own
day, especially those driven by (misplaced, we now know) concerns
about the age of the earth like those raised by William Thomson, Lord
Kelvin, Darwin began to increase the importance of
&ldquo;sports&rdquo; in later revisions of his works, large variations
that could cause brief periods of rapid phenotypic change. That said,
when a reference is made in contemporary work to the
&ldquo;Darwinian&rdquo; position on tempo and mode, it is clearly his
early, extreme gradualism that authors have in mind.</p>

<h3 id="EvolEthiAltrGrouSele">3.6 Evolutionary Ethics, Altruism, and Group Selection</h3>

<p>
In-depth discussions of the contemporary state of the field on
evolutionary ethics and biological altruism would take us too far
afield for our purposes here, and each is the subject of a separate
article in this encyclopedia (see
 <a href="../morality-biology/">morality and evolutionary biology</a>;
 <a href="../altruism-biological/">biological altruism</a>). In short, ethical behavior seems to pose at least two
<em>prima facie</em> challenges for evolutionary explanations. First,
how could genuinely altruistic behavior, which seems to involve
organisms making sacrifices for others, evolve under the strict
optimizing regime of natural selection? And second, what is the
relationship between evolutionary explanations of our mental and
perceptual capacities and our understanding of moral knowledge? Must
evolutionary theory undermine or &ldquo;debunk&rdquo; any claims to
true moral beliefs (see the entry on
 <a href="../moral-epistemology/">moral epistemology</a>)?</p>
 
<p>
It is worth underlining here, however, that debate around
Darwin&rsquo;s own position on these issues has turned on whether or
not Darwin was genuinely offering us a &ldquo;group-selection&rdquo;
explanation for moral traits in human beings (e.g., Ruse and Richards
2016). This question, in addition to testing the limits of our ability
to interpret precious little source material found in Darwin&rsquo;s
own writings, is difficult also because of the host of issues that
might be implicated in the effort to explicate just what we mean by
&ldquo;a group-selection explanation&rdquo; of a particular
phenomenon.</p>

<p>
As we mentioned in
 <a href="#NatuPoweScopSele">section 3.2</a>
 above, in linking the question of species&rsquo; metaphysical
individuality to the hierarchy of natural selection, Stephen Jay Gould
offers us a window onto the conceptual complexity to which this debate
can lead. His title exemplifies one approach to group
selection&mdash;the unit of selection is always the individual, but
there are individuals other than individual organisms that are subject
to selection. A very different result emerges if one assumes that
groups of organisms such as demes, kin-groups, or species, though not
individuals, are nevertheless subject to selection. Adding to the
conceptual complexity, some researchers propose that the term
&lsquo;group selection&rsquo; be restricted to the process whereby
group-level traits provide advantages to one group over another, in
which case there are strict conditions delimiting cases of group
selection. Others define group selection primarily in terms of group
level <em>effects</em>. Thus a debate analogous to that earlier
discussed regarding the definitions of &lsquo;fitness&rsquo; emerges
here&mdash;by group selection do we mean a distinct type of causal
process that needs to be conceptually distinguished from selection at
the level of individual organism or gene, or do we merely mean a
tendency within certain populations for some well-defined groups to
displace others over time? (For further discussion, see Sterelny and
Griffiths 1999, 151&ndash;179; Hull 2001, 49&ndash;90; and see the
entry on
 <a href="../selection-units/">levels and units of selection</a>.)</p>
 
<h2 id="Conc">4. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
We hope that this survey has demonstrated, first and foremost, the
rich past and present of philosophical reflections both about and
inspired by Darwin&rsquo;s theory of evolution by natural selection.
Furthermore, as we have seen, Darwin&rsquo;s own positions and works
remain touchstones for such reflections, not only because he was the
theory&rsquo;s first proponent, but also because his positions still
offer us a useful frame of reference as well as a host of
sophisticated insights. To be sure, the philosophy and practice of
biology have advanced significantly in the intervening nearly two
hundred years since Darwin&rsquo;s first notebooks on natural
selection. But if history is any guide, considering whether and how
these innovations depart from Darwin&rsquo;s own views on the subject
will be a fruitful enterprise well into the theory&rsquo;s next
century.</p>

Though there are an abundance of web sites on Darwinism, the three
most useful sites meeting the highest of academic standards are listed
below. The first is the official site for the publication of material
in the extensive Darwin Archives at Cambridge University, but has
grown to become the default site for Darwin texts and related
literature as well. The second is the official site for on-line
publication of Darwin&rsquo;s extensive correspondence. The third site
is a very good starting point amd links to sites related to Charles
Darwin&rsquo;s historical context.</p>

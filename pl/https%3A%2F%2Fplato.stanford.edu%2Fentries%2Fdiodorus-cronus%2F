Diodorus Cronus (died circa 284 BCE) was a figure widely known and
admired in antiquity, for his dialectical skills, contributions to the
study of logic and his philosophical views. Recent philosophy and
scholarship have engaged with his Master Argument and his modal
system, but other aspects of his thought, including a version of
atomism, arguments against change, ambiguity, singular reference and
past-tense statements, have been relatively neglected. Debates over
his affiliation have played an important role in the historiography of
post-classical Greek philosophy, in particular whether there was a
Dialectical school, of which Diodorus would be a principal
representative.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="Biog">1. Biography</h2>

<p>
Diodorus was born in Iasos, a city in ancient Caria, on the west coast
of modern-day Turkey. Iasos had been part of the Delian league during
the Peloponnesian war (431&ndash;404BCE) and Diodorus studied
dialectic with a minor teacher Apollonius Cronus, a native of Cyrene.
Diodorus inherited the nickname, &lsquo;Cronus&rsquo;, from
Apollonius. &lsquo;Cronus&rsquo; seems to have meant &lsquo;old
codger&rsquo; (Plato <em>Euthydemus</em> 287b), although it may also
have implied &lsquo;cunning&rsquo; (D&ouml;ring 1972, 124; Muller
1985, 128; Iliad II 205; Odyssey XXI, 415; Hesiod <em>Theogony</em>
18). Apollonius had studied with Eubulides of Miletus, a student of
Euclides of Megara. Euclides was a long-standing member of the
Socratic circle (<em>Phaedo</em> 59b-c; <em>Theaetetus</em>
142a-143b).</p>

<p>
Diodorus&rsquo; date of death is easier to establish than his date of
birth. David Sedley has shown that Diodorus died in Alexandria around
284BCE (Sedley 1977, 80), a date now generally accepted (Sorabji 1980,
106; Algra 1999, 52; Duncombe 2023). Diodorus was teaching in Athens
in the 310s BCE, where we know he taught Zeno of Citum, founder of
Stoicism, and Philo the Logician, Diodorus&rsquo; colleague in the
Dialectical school. The sceptic Arcesilaus arrived in Athens around
295BCE and was at least influenced by Diodorus, if not directly taught
by him. When Ptolemy Soter (d. 282&ndash;3) began to draw Greek
intellectuals to Alexandria, it seems Diodorus joined them. In
Alexandria, Diodorus was sufficiently well known that Callimachus
could feature him in epigrams. Callimachus himself did not arrive in
Alexandria until 290&ndash;85. We know from Diogenes Laertius (DL, 2,
111&ndash;2) that Diodorus died during the reign of Ptolemy Soter, so
before 283&ndash;2. If Diodorus died in Alexandria, it cannot have
been before 290 and was probably after 285, but before 283&ndash;2,
making 284 a reasonable conjecture.</p>

<p>
Aside from the historical interest, dating Diodorus death to the
mid-280s makes it extremely unlikely that Aristotle (c.384-322) was
influenced by Diodorus. Even if Diodorus had an exceptionally long
career of 50 years, starting, say in 334BCE, his active period barely
overlaps with Aristotle&rsquo;s lifetime. Diodorus did use technical
language we find in Aristotle&rsquo;s writings and some of his
arguments follow Aristotle&rsquo;s closely, so it seems possible that
Didodorus had access to Aristotle&rsquo;s texts, presumably while they
were still in circulation before the death of Theophrastus (Falcon
2014). But given that Diodorus must have been relatively young, it
seems that an influence would have been from Aristotle to
Diodorus.</p>

<p>
Diodorus was traditionally thought to be part of the Megaric school,
founded by Euclides of Megara. However, the scholarly consensus is now
that Diodorus was part of a separate Dialectical School. Diodorus is
described in our most reliable sources as a &lsquo;dialectician&rsquo;
(or &lsquo;Dialectician&rsquo;), and it is only very late that we have
evidence that he was called a &lsquo;Megaric&rsquo; (Denyer 2002),
although it is possible that Chrysippus termed certain paradoxes
developed by Diodorus &lsquo;Megaric questions&rsquo; (D&ouml;ring
1989, 297; Ebert 2008, 279; Allen 2018, 36&ndash;37). For detailed
discussion of this issue, see the entry on the Dialectical School.</p>

<h2 id="Meta">2. Metaphysics</h2>

<h3 id="MastArgu">2.1 The Master Argument</h3>

<p>
The main testimony for the Master Argument comes from Epictetus and he
tells us the following:</p>

<blockquote>
The Master Argument seems to have been put from these sorts of
premises. For these three conflict with each other: Every past truth
is necessary; the impossible does not follow from the possible; there
is a possible truth which neither is true nor will be. When he saw
this conflict, Diodorus used the persuasiveness of the first two
premises to establish that nothing is possible that neither is true
nor will be (Epictetus <em>Discourses</em>, 2, 19, 1.1&ndash;2.1 =
D&ouml;ring 131).
</blockquote>

<p>
Epictetus&rsquo; report gives us the following information:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(MA1)</dt>
<dd>Every past truth is necessary;</dd>
<dt>(MA2)</dt>
<dd>The impossible does not follow from the possible;</dd>
<dt>(MA3)</dt>
<dd>There is a possible truth which neither is true nor will be.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
But (MA1) to (MA3) are reported to form an inconsistent triad; so we
must deny one of them. Diodorus denied (MA3). That is, he
affirmed:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(D)</dt>
<dd>All possible truths are either true or will be true (cf. Boethius,
<em>Commentary on the De Interpretatione of Aristotle</em>,
234.22&ndash;26 = D&ouml;ring 138).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The Master Argument is sometimes thought to be an argument for
fatalism (see the relevant section of the entry on
 <a href="../fatalism/#LogiFataDiodCronNecePast">fatalism</a>,
 the discussion of the Master Argument in the entry on the
 <a href="../dialectical-school/">Dialectical School</a>
 and the entry on
 <a href="../prior/#OrigTensLogi">Arthur Prior</a>).
 Sometimes it is thought to be an argument for Diodorus&rsquo; account
of possibility. Sometimes (including by Epictetus at
<em>Discourses</em>, 2.18,17) it is thought to be a paradox or sophism
to be solved. These are not exclusive options. Taken as a sophism we
can see the argument as a trilemma, or a demonstration that the three
premises are inconsistent and so one must be rejected. Diodorus could
then be seen to reject the third, to yield his account of possibility.
Diodorus account of possibility was taken in antiquity to yield a form
of fatalism, since only what is now or will be true is possible
(Alexander <em>In An. Pr.</em> 183.34 &ndash; 184.10). That is,
anything not true now or in the future is impossible. I&rsquo;m not a
lawyer and never will be; so, according to Diodorus definition of
possibility, it is not merely false, but also impossible that I be a
lawyer.</p>

<p>
We do not know precisely how Diodorus formulated the argument. It
seems likely that, in the centuries separating Didorus&rsquo;
formulation from Epictetus report, some degree of regimentation had
already taken place (Marion and Rukert, 2016, 211n55). Epictetus
formulates the argument as a trilemma to exhibit the logical space of
options, and to contrast the approaches of the Dialectician Panthoides
(who rejected MA1), the Stoic logician Chrysippus (who rejected MA2)
and Diodorus himself (who rejected MA3). The trilemma had become a
common technique for presenting a philosophical issue (Seel, 1993,
295), but it unlikely that the originator of the argument presented it
this way, since we know that Diodorus used MA1 and MA2 as premises to
argue for D, not merely to show that MA3 is incompatible with MA1 and
MA2 and invite us to reject one. Epictetus also presents the premises
in assertoric, rather than interrogative, form and Diodorus would
likely have presented the argument dialectically, although it does not
come down to us in that form.</p>

<p>
Although the contemporary literature on the Master Argument involves
machinery from modal and temporal logic, in ancient times the argument
was well-known outside philosophical circles, and was discussed in
informal, social contexts (Epictetus, <em>Discourses</em> 2.19.8),
suggesting that it could be stated informally. None of the ancient
logicians who knew how the Master Argument was formulated thought that
it was invalid, since the approach seems to have been to reject one or
more premises. So, it must have been plausibly valid to thinkers with
a range of logical views.</p>

<p>
Here is one tentative, non-technical way to think about the moves in
the argument, which may resemble Diodorus&rsquo; presentation. I did
not train in gymnastics in childhood; so I am not now an Olympic
gymnast. Neither will I be in the future. It is now too late for me to
be an Olympic gymnast! But is it possible that I am or will be an
Olympic gymnast? Suppose that it is possible that I will be an Olympic
gymnast. That implies that I did train in gymnastics from childhood.
But, since I did not train in gymnastics from childhood, it is by now
impossible that I trained in gymnastics. So if it is possible that I
will be an Olympic gymnast, an impossibility would follow from that
possibility. But the impossible does not follow the possible. So, it
is not possible that I will be an Olympic gymnast.</p>

<p>
A similar line of thought would block the present possibility of me
being an Olympic gymnast. Suppose it is possible that I am now an
Olympic gymnast. That implies that I did train in gymnastics from
childhood. But, since I did not train in gymnastics from childhood, it
is by now impossible that I trained in gymnastics. So if it is
possible that I am an Olympic gymnast, an impossibility would follow.
But the impossible does not follow the possible. So, it is not
possible that I am an Olympic gymnast. Hence, unless I either am, or
will be, and Olympic gymnast, it is not possible for me to be an
Olympic gymnast.</p>

<h3 id="AnteMast">2.2 Antecedents of the Master</h3>

<p>
We find a possible antecedent to the Master Argument in
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Metaphysics</em> 9.3. There are two relevant
parts of that passage. The first is an account of potentialities which
Aristotle attributes to &lsquo;the Megarics&rsquo; and others:</p>

<blockquote>
There are some who say, for example, the Megarics, that something is
possible only when it is actual and that thing is not possible when it
is not actual. For example, someone who is not building cannot build,
but someone who is building can when building. Similarly in the other
cases. (<em>Metaphysics</em> 9.3, 1046b29&ndash;32)
</blockquote>

<p>
Although the precise view, and the identity of those who hold the
view, is disputed, the target view seems to be that that something has
a power or capacity only when that capacity is manifest. Roughly:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(M0)</dt>
<dd>\(\alpha\) can \(\phi\) only when \(\alpha\) is \(\phi\)-ing.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
For example, a builder can build only when in fact building. M0
resembles D for M0 looks like another way to reject MA3. According to
MA3, it is possible that a builder builds, while in fact the builder
is not building and never will. But according to M0, while the builder
is not building, the builder cannot build. If what the builder cannot
do is not possible for the builder, then it is not possible that the
builder builds, while not, in fact, building. You might think that M0
and D are both motivated by a suspicion of mere possibilities, that
is, possibilities that exist but remain unactualized.</p>

<p>
On the other hand, D differs from M0 in three important ways. First,
M0 is formulated in terms of the powers that individuals have to act:
a builder can build only when building. D is formulated in terms of
whole propositions being true or possible. Second, M0 is a one way
conditional, while D makes an equivalence claim between a possible
truth and what is or will be true, so would be a biconditional. Third,
and most importantly, D involves a disjunction: anything possible
either is true or will be; M0 makes no such distinction between
present and future truths. How can these differences be explained?</p>

<p>
There are two (compatible) explanations for the first difference.
First, it might simply be appealing to think, like Aristotle, that
modal truths, such as, &lsquo;it is possible that the builder
build&rsquo; are grounded in facts about individuals and their powers,
such as the builder and his power to build. If that is the case, then
the move to a propositional formulation would be relatively harmless,
and amenable to both those who think there are existing, but
unactualised, possibilities, and those who don&rsquo;t. The second is
that Diodorus himself was one of the originators of propositional
logic (see the entry on the
 <a href="../dialectical-school/#BegiPropLogi">Dialectical School</a>).
 Thus, it would be natural for him to formulate the point using modal
operators on propositions, rather than in terms of individuals and
their powers. The formulation would look like this:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(D1)</dt>
<dd>It is possible that \(p\) only if it is true that \(p\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
There is no reason to think that this was an actual interim stage in
the development, but it is useful to consider for heuristic purposes.
Once we consider D1, the second difference between M0 and D can also
be explained simply too. It is natural to think that:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(T)</dt>
<dd>If it is true that \(p\), then it is possible that \(p\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
In fact, this is just to accept the T axiom of modal logic, which many
modal logics accept. These two taken together would allow a
biconditional formulation like this:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(D2)</dt>
<dd>It is possible that \(p\) if and only if it is true that
\(p\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The third difference is a little more philosophically interesting.
Aristotle presents a series of arguments against M0. One of the most
powerful is that M0 seems to rule out change (<em>Metaphysics</em>
9.3, 1047a10&ndash;15). Aristotle&rsquo;s basic line of thought is
that, according to M0, \(a\) can sit only when sitting. So, when \(a\)
is sitting can \(a\) stand? Apparently not:</p>

<ol type="i">

<li>if \(a\) is sitting, \(a\) is not standing.</li>

<li>But if \(a\) is not standing, \(a\) lacks the power to stand (from
M0).</li>

<li>If \(a\) lacks the power to stand, \(a\) cannot stand.</li>

<li>If \(a\) cannot stand, \(a\) will not stand in the future.</li>

<li>So, if \(a\) is sitting, \(a\) does not stand in the future.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Since &lsquo;sitting&rsquo; and &lsquo;standing&rsquo; are just
arbitrary properties, the argument generalises to all change.
Aristotle would need some suppressed premise to connect the idea that
something cannot stand to the idea that it never will stand. Such a
principle might be found in <em>De Caelo</em> 1, 11&ndash;12 (Makin
and Denyer 2000).</p>

<p>
This sort of argument could be blocked by accepting the disjunctive
account that what is possible is true or will be. For in that case,
even if <em>a</em> lacks the power to stand now, it does not follow
that <em>a</em> cannot stand in the future. That is, suppose
<em>a</em> is sitting. With the disjunctive account, at present, if
<em>a</em> is not standing, <em>a</em> may still be able to stand, as
long as <em>a</em> turns out to be standing in the future. Thus, the
Diodorean account of possibility could be a development of the Megaric
position on powers. But even if D is historically connected to the
Megaric position in <em>Metaphysics</em> 9.3, it does not follow that
Diodorus was affiliated to a Megaric &lsquo;school&rsquo;, especially
because the Master Argument seems to defend D on independent
grounds.</p>

<p>
That suffices for MA3, the negation of which is supposed to be the
conclusion of the Master Argument. What about the premises that lead
us to that conclusion? MA2 tells us that entailment cannot take us
from possibilities to impossibilities: possibility is closed under
entailment. Some readers, such as (Mates 1953, 39) and (Denyer 1981b),
have thought that we should understand MA2 in terms of Diodorus&rsquo;
own account of &lsquo;following&rsquo;, which we know from other
sources (SE <em>M</em> 8, 112&ndash;117 = D&ouml;ring 142): a
conditional is true iff it is not possible that the antecedent is true
and the consequent false. It is unclear whether Diodorus intended his
own notion of &lsquo;possible&rsquo; here. But since the Master
Argument seems to have been intended to argue for Diodorean
possibilities, he could not invoke his own notion without begging the
question. Probably the best way to understand this premise also
appeals to <em>Metaphysics</em> 9.3. After Aristotle has rebutted the
Megaric position, Aristotle introduces a &lsquo;test&rsquo; for
whether something is possible:</p>

<blockquote>
What is possible is that for which, if the actuality of what is said
to have the possibility obtains, then nothing impossible will result.
(<em>Metaphysics</em> 9.3, 1047a24&ndash;6)
</blockquote>

<p>
This test works like this. To test whether \(p\) is possible, suppose
<em>p</em> is actual. If nothing impossible follows this supposition,
\(p\) is possible. I am sitting and we want to test whether it is
possible that I stand. So, suppose I stand. If nothing impossible
results from this supposition, it is possible that I stand. The
problem is, stated as baldly as this, the test is underdetermined. I
can apply the test making no accommodations: I am sitting in a room
where no one is standing. And we want to test whether it is possible
that I stand. So, suppose I stand. In that case, I am standing but
also no one in this room is standing. This is a contradiction and so
an impossibility. So it turns out that, according to the test, I
cannot stand. It seems unreasonable to apply the test with no
accommodation whatsoever, but also unreasonable to allow all
accommodations by changing the truth-value of any proposition. If
I&rsquo;m maximally accommodating, only self-contradictory
propositions turn out impossible. So we can hold some propositions as
a fixed background for testing some <em>p</em>, for example, the
necessary truths. The advantage of understanding MA2 in light of this
test is that it gives a clear way to operationalize MA2 &ndash; using
this idea of supposition- and also it is a conception of possibility
shared by people like Aristotle who hold that some possibilities are
not and never will be realized (although cf. Makin and Denyer
2000).</p>

<p>
Finally, what about MA1? MA1 seems obvious: the past is fixed,
what&rsquo;s done is done and cannot be undone, and something like
this was accepted by Aristotle, who quotes Agathon: &lsquo;For even
from god this power is kept, this power alone/To make it true that
what&rsquo;s been done had never been&rsquo; (<em>Nicomachean
Ethics</em> 1139b10, Trans. Broadie and Rowe). But MA1 is not just
saying that the past is irrevocable; it is saying that it is
necessary. There are things which are irrevocable which are, for all
that, not necessary. For example, it is not within my power to change
what happens is a distant galaxy: from my standpoint, what happens far
away is unalterable. But what happens in a distant galaxy is not
always necessary: there are irrevocable, but contingent, truths.</p>

<p>
Even with this caveat, MA1 needs careful formulation. Martha Kneale
(Kneale 1937) introduced three classes of counterexample to MA1 into
this literature, but her contribution is sometimes overlooked. These
counterexamples are cases where a past truth seems to become false.
But a past truth that can become false is not a necessary truth. The
first class of counter examples are past negative existentials. (i)
&lsquo;There has never been a female Labour UK Prime Minister&rsquo;.
This is a past truth, but it could become false, if the UK elects a
female Labour Prime Minister. The second class are past temporal
distance. (ii) &lsquo;Socrates died 2422 years ago&rsquo; is a past
truth in 2023, but will be a past falsehood from 2024 onwards.
Kneale&rsquo;s third class are past definite descriptions, such as
(iii) &lsquo;The UK Prime Minister who completed a PhD was
Scottish&rsquo;. Should the UK elect another holder of a doctorate,
this would become false.</p>

<p>
The solution may be to notice &ndash; with (Denyer 2009, 38&ndash;39)
who follows (Prior 1967) &ndash; that not every sentence that involves
a past tense is a past-tense sentence. All three of Kneale&rsquo;s
cases are not past truths in the sense that the main operator of the
sentence is a past-tense operator, but rather the main connective is
either a negation or an existential quantifier. For example
&lsquo;There has never been a female Labour UK Prime Minister&rsquo;
can be written as &lsquo;It is not the case that there has been a
female Labour UK Prime Minister&rsquo;. This is formalised as
&lsquo;\(\neg \langle P\rangle p\)&rsquo; where &lsquo;\(p\)&rsquo; is
the present-tense sentence &lsquo;there is a female Labour UK Prime
Minister&rsquo; and &lsquo;\(\langle P\rangle\)&rsquo; is the
past-tense operator &lsquo;it has been the case that&hellip;&rsquo;.
If (i) changes its truth value when a female Labour Prime Minister is
elected, that is only because (i) is a present-tense negated
sentence.</p>

<p>
With all that, however, taking an historical perspective on the Master
Argument, as well as the more common logical perspective, shows why
the Master Argument might be appealing. It develops a conclusion that
is radically anti-Aristotelian, that what is possible is or will be
the case, a modal collapse, from premises that an Aristotelian would
accept, and indeed, that Aristotle appears to have accepted. Not only
that, but it seems that Diodorus&rsquo; notion of modality differs in
an explicable way from the Megarics of <em>Metaphysics</em> 9.3,
perhaps in response to Aristotle&rsquo;s criticism, while retaining
the spirit of their view.</p>

<h3 id="FateDiodModaSyst">2.3 Fate and the Diodorean Modal System</h3>

<p>
The Master Argument is supposed to be, amongst other things, an
argument for &lsquo;fatalism&rsquo; or &lsquo;logical
determinism&rsquo;, because it argues for Diodorus&rsquo; notion of
possibility, which leaves no room for counterfactual possibilities and
hence rules out freedom. Several sources report Diodorus&rsquo;
account of possibility (Boethius On Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>On
Interpretation</em> 234.22&ndash;6; Alexander <em>On Aristotle&rsquo;s
Prior Analytics</em> 183&ndash;4; Simplicius <em>On Aristotle&rsquo;s
Categories</em> 196, 220&ndash;25). According to these sources,
Diodorus&rsquo; view is that: it is possible that \(p\) just in case
either \(p\) is the true or will be true. Here is Alexander&rsquo;s
report:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
According to him it is possible for me to be at Corinth if I am at
Corinth or if, otherwise, I am going to be at Corinth. But if I were
never in Corinth, it would not be possible. And a child&rsquo;s
becoming a grammarian is possible if he ever becomes one. (Alexander
<em>On Aristotle&rsquo;s Prior Analytics</em>, 183&ndash;4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This case fits well with the other reports. It is possible that
Alexander is in Corinth if either he is in Corinth or is going to be
in Corinth. It is possible that a child becomes a grammarian if he
does in fact become one. In general, where &lsquo;\(p\)&rsquo; is a
present tensed content, and &lsquo;\(\langle F\rangle \ldots\)&rsquo;
is a one-place modal operator meaning &lsquo;it will be the case at
some future time that&hellip;&rsquo;, then:</p>

<blockquote>

<dl class="partag">
<dt><em>Diodorean Possibility</em>.</dt>
<dd>It is possible that \(p\) iff \(p\) or \(\langle F\rangle p\)</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>
Diodorean possibility ignores any intrinsic features of Alexander or
the child, for example, whether the child has the capacity to learn
grammar. All that Diodorean possibility cares about is what in fact
turns out to be the case. What is more, if evaluating whether \(p\) is
possible, we only take account of what is true now and in the future.
So if we know the truth values of a proposition at all times (or even
just all future times), we know whether it is Diodorean possible. This
contrasts with our usual modal notion of possibility. Suppose that
\(p\) is always false. Is it possible? On a standard notion of
possibility, the answer is &lsquo;we cannot tell&rsquo;, for we cannot
tell whether \(p\) is possible, even if we know its actual truth
values at all times. But for Diodorus, the answer is
&lsquo;no&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Since Diodorus links modalities to time, how he thought about time
will impact on his modal notions. Generally, scholars assume that for
Diodorus time is linear, discrete, and has no beginning or end moment.
To be linear means, informally, that time does not branch in either
the forwards or backwards direction. To be discrete means that each
moment that has a successor (or predecessor) has a corresponding
immediate successor (or predecessor).</p>

<p>
It is easy to derive other modalities in a standard way from Diodorean
possibility. Assuming that &lsquo;Necessarily \(p\)&rsquo; is
equivalent to &lsquo;not-possibly not \(p\)&rsquo; and that
&lsquo;contingently \(p\)&rsquo; is equivalent to
&lsquo;possibly-\(p\) and not-necessarily \(p\)&rsquo; we can arrive
at:</p>

<blockquote>

<dl class="partag">
<dt><em>Diodrean Necessity</em>.</dt>
<dd>Necessarily \(p\) iff \(p\) and [\(F\)]\(p\).</dd>
<dt><em>Diodorean Contingency</em>.</dt>
<dd>\(\langle C\rangle p\) iff ((\(p\) or \(\langle F\rangle p\)) and
not (\(p\) and [\(F\)]\(p\)))</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>
Where &lsquo;[\(F]p\)&rsquo; is read as &lsquo;it will be the case at
every future time that \(p\)&rsquo; and &lsquo;\(\langle C\rangle
p\)&rsquo; as &lsquo;it is possible and not necessary that
\(p\)&rsquo;. So it is now necessary that Alexander is in Corinth iff
Alexander is in Corinth and always will be. It is now contingent that
Alexander is in Corinth iff Alexander is either not now in Corinth but
will be or is now in Corinth but will not be.</p>

<p>
So this modal scheme allows for present contingents. Does it allow
future contingents? In a limited sense, yes, according to Denyer
(1981b). What this scheme does allow are future asynchronous
contingencies. Will it be contingent tomorrow that Alexander is in
Corinth? That is:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\langle F\rangle \langle C\rangle p\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This would cash out to:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\langle F\rangle\)((\(p\) or \(\langle F\rangle p\)) and not (\(p\)
and [\(F\)]\(p\))).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And that can hold in two circumstances. Either tomorrow, Alexander
will not be in Corinth, but will be the day after. Or, tomorrow,
Alexander will not be in Corinth but will be the day after. The
Diodorean modal scheme also allows synchronous future contingents,
when at some future time (possibly \(p\) and possibly not-\(p)\):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\langle F\rangle\)(\(\Diamond p\) and \(\Diamond\)not-\(p\)).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
By substitution, this would result in:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\langle F\rangle\)((\(p\) or \(\langle F\rangle p\)) and (not-\(p\)
or \(\langle F\rangle\)not-\(p\))).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But that can be satisfied if, say, tomorrow Alexander is in Corinth
and will not be the day after. It would also be satisfied if tomorrow
Alexander is in Corinth the day after but not tomorrow. So there are
at least some future contingents.</p>

<p>
But is this enough to say that the Diodorean modal system is not
&lsquo;deterministic&rsquo;? Bobzien (1993, 73) rejects Denyer
(1981b), who claims that the system is not deterministic, as it allows
future contingents in the above senses. Bobzien argues that this sense
of future contingents is still deterministic, since determinism is
concerned with free action and actions are particular events at
particular times. Diodorus&rsquo; modal system, she claims, cannot
allow simultaneous possibilities for events at the same time. Although
it is unclear whether any ancient critic could have articulated the
point this way, Bobzien claims, where &lsquo;\(t)n\)&rsquo; is a rigid
designator for the present moment (in her case 12 noon on 3rd
September 1991), &lsquo;Dio is walking at \(t_n\)&rsquo; is not
Diodorean contingent, as this would mean that Dio would have to walk
and not walk at precisely that time, which is impossible, or we say,
as above, that &lsquo;Dio is walking at \(t_n\)&rsquo; is true at some
future time and false at some other future time. But we cannot say
that, since from \(t_n\) onwards, the matter is settled one way or
another. So, says Bobzien, Diodorean modalities are deterministic in
the sense that they do not allow present contingencies about specific
events.</p>

<p>
This dispute is important, since one key question is just how
&lsquo;deterministic&rsquo; Diodorus&rsquo; modal system is, but very
little literature addresses that question. On Denyer&rsquo;s view,
Diodorus is weakly deterministic, as it allows for future contingents,
on a particular understanding of them. &lsquo;It will be the case that
Dio walks&rsquo; is a future contingent, since there is a time further
in the future when Dio walks a time still further in the future when
he does not. For Bobzein, this is still deterministic, not because she
thinks that to be non-deterministic, you need future contingents with
robust counter-factual modalities, but rather because, even on a
Diodorean understanding, by the time some specific moment, \(t_n\), is
present, &lsquo;(possibly Dio is walking and possibly Dio is not
walking)&rsquo; is not true, so whether Dio is walking is not a
contingent matter at any present moment. Since non-determined actions
only take place in the present, and it is not contingent for Dio
whether he is walking at any present moment, \(t_n\), it is determined
whether Dio is walking or not.</p>

<p>
It does seem that Diodorus could hold on to present contingents.
Diodorus was a temporal atomist, in that he holds that time is
composed of discrete indivisible units of duration, which implies that
the timeline is non-dense, i.e. it is not the case that between any
two moments there is a third moment. He could accept Bobzein&rsquo;s
point &ndash; at any given atomic moment, \(t_n\), Dio walks or he
does not walk. If Dio walks at \(t_n\), it is fixed at \(t_n\) that
Dio walks. But this is precisely what we would expect, given Diodorus
atomism. It does not follow from this that Dio cannot be walking at
\(t_n\) and not walking at the next atomic moment, \(t_{n+1}\). And if
that turns out to be the case, then it is contingent at \(t_n\) that
Dio is walking, since it is possible that he walks (because he is in
fact walking at \(tn)\) and not necessary that he walks (because he is
not walking later). The only exception to this is the last moment of
time. If \(t_n\) is the last moment of time, it cannot be the case
that Dio is not walking at \(t_{n+1}\), and so, it is not contingent
that Dio is walking at \(t_n\).</p>

<p>
Diodorus&rsquo; atomism assists this sort of argument, since this
argument does not work if time is dense. If time is dense, then
between \(t_n\) and \(t_{n+1}\) there is a third moment, call it
\(t_{n+ 1/2}\). We are assuming that tn is the last moment of
Dion&rsquo;s walking, since \(t_{n+1}\) is the first moment of
Dion&rsquo;s not walking. So is Dio walking or not walking at \(t_{n+
1/2}\)? Either answer has a powerful argument against it. On the one
hand, Dio is not walking at \(t_{n+ 1/2}\), for \(t_n\) was the last
moment of his walking. But, on the other hand, Dio is <em>not</em> not
walking at \(t_{n+ 1/2}\), for \(t_{n+1}\) is the first moment of his
not walking.</p>

<p>
Diodorus cannot have continuous change. Suppose changes from Dio
walking to not walking between \(t_n\) and \(t_{n+1}\). Since there
are only temporal atoms, there can only be &lsquo;leaps&rsquo; between
Dio walking and not walking. Diodorus can certainly say that there are
synchronous possibilities. Whether this is enough for Dio to be acting
freely when he walks, is a wider issue. But it certainly does not rule
out Dio from acting freely on the grounds the present is fixed.</p>

<p>
More worrying for those who are concerned with human freedom might be
Diodorus&rsquo; commitment to the view that what will never happen is
impossible. If, as a matter of fact, Dio always walks from \(t_n\)
onwards, it is, at \(t_n\) impossible that Dio does not walk. Dio is
freely walking only if he could do otherwise. On Diodorus&rsquo; view,
Dion, while walking at \(t_n\), is not freely walking, since it is not
possible for him to do otherwise. Similarly, one might say that Dio is
sitting, but not freely sitting, if chained to the floor. That may be
right. But there is no reason to think that Diodorus must accept the
&lsquo;could do otherwise&rsquo; condition on free action.
Compatibilists reject that condition too. Diodorean modalities are
compatible with a variety of views about human freedom except,
perhaps, the most implausible sort of libertarianism.</p>

<p>
We can see this if we look at how Diodorean modality works with the
Lazy Argument. On Diodorus view, if it turns out that I pass my exam,
it turns out impossible that I failed. On the other hand, if it turns
out that I fail my exam, it turns out impossible that I passed. But
nothing about that determines how it will turn out. So, I am still
motivated to work hard, since what is not yet determined is whether I
will pass or fail. From an ethical perspective, this might lead into a
philosophical consolation, of sorts. It is not determined how things
will turn out, but once they have turned out a certain way, there is
no point worrying about it, since by then it could not have been
otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="Logi">3. Logic</h2>

<h3 id="Cond">3.1 Conditionals</h3>

<p>
Lots of sources point to intense debate in our period on the nature of
conditionals. An epigram of Callimachus jokes that the debate was so
widespread that even the crows on the rooftops were cawing about it
(Sextus <em>M1</em> 309.4&ndash;7 = D&ouml;ring 128 (part))! What
remains of this rich debate is somewhat murky, but it does allow us to
make some informed interpretations of Diodorus&rsquo; views on the
conditional. The main source is again, Sextus (<em>PH</em>
110&ndash;112), who distinguishes four conditionals in order of
strength: Philo&rsquo;s, Diodorus&rsquo;, Connection (which was
probably Chrysippus&rsquo; on the evidence of DL 7 73) and Meaning.
Sextus orders the conditionals in terms of logical strength, but it
unclear which was the first to arise chronologically (<em>pace</em>
(Sedley 1977, 101). It may be that Philo&rsquo;s arose first, and was
refined in response to something like the paradoxes of material
implication.</p>

<p>
In any case, a conditional is true, according to Philo just in case
&lsquo;it does not begin with a truth and end with a falsehood&rsquo;
(Sextus <em>PH</em> II 110. Translation Annas and Barnes, modified.
Cf. <em>M</em> II 114). For example, &lsquo;if it is day, I am
conversing&rsquo;, is true when both it is day and I am conversing.
Philo is usually interpreted as articulating the modern material
conditional (Sedley 1977, 101; Mates 1949, 234; Mates 1953, 43). That
is, where &lsquo;\(\to\)&rsquo; is the material conditional:</p>

<blockquote>

<dl class="partag">
<dt>(PHILO)</dt>
<dd>&lsquo;if \(p\) then \(q\)&rsquo; is a true Philo conditional iff
\((p\) \(\to\) \(q)\).</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>
Sextus then tells us that Diodorus conditional is one that
&lsquo;neither could nor can begin from truth and end in
falsehood&rsquo; (<em>PH</em> 2110 Trans. Annas and Barnes, modified.
Cf. <em>M</em> 2.115).</p>

<blockquote>

<dl class="partag">
<dt>(DIODORUS)</dt>
<dd>&lsquo;if \(p\) then \(q\)&rsquo; is a true Diodorean conditional
iff it (i) neither was possible nor (ii) is possible that \((p\) &amp;
not\(-q)\).</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>
Some scholars took Diodorus to be anticipating modern notions of
strict implication (e.g. Hurst, 1935, 485). That view has been
discredited, since the Diodorean conditional should be stronger than
the strict conditional: &lsquo;if \(p\) then \(q\)&rsquo; is a true
Diodorean conditional iff the proposition that \(p\) now strictly
implies the proposition that \(q\) and the proposition that \(p\) has
always strictly implied the proposition that \(q\). Instead, it is
common to follow Mates (Mates 1949) and hold that a conditional holds
in the Diodorean sense iff it holds in in Philo&rsquo;s sense all
times. That is where &lsquo;\(\to\)&rsquo; represents the material
conditional:</p>

<blockquote>

<dl class="partag">
<dt>(ALL-TIME)</dt>
<dd>&lsquo;if \(p\) then \(q\)&rsquo; is a true Diodorean conditional
iff at all times, \((p\)\(\to\)\(q)\).</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>
So &lsquo;if it is day, I am conversing&rsquo; turns out false, since
there are times when &lsquo;it is day&rsquo; is true, but &lsquo;I am
conversing&rsquo; is false (Cf. \(M 2 115)\). One quibble with this
common way to understand Diodorus&rsquo; conditionals is that
Philo&rsquo;s conditional is not obviously the material conditional,
since ancient propositions tend to be tensed and the material
conditional both is a tenseless proposition and conjoins tenseless
propositions. A more serious difficulty with Mates&rsquo; reading is
that it makes clause (ii) redundant. (i) on its own, read in line with
Diodorean possibility, would yield the ALL-TIME conditional (as
pointed out by Mates himself (Mates 1949, 238)). So why would Diodorus
formulate his conditional with the redundant clause? Third, for
Diodorus, if something is true at all times, it is necessarily true.
So, for Diodorus the ALL-TIME conditional will just be a strict
conditional. But we saw that Diodorus&rsquo; conditional should be
stronger than the strict conditional. All this has led some to suggest
that Diodorus&rsquo; conditional, while intended to be stronger that
Philo&rsquo;s, tried to be more neutral and so compatible with a range
of views of possibility, each of which would yield different accounts
of the conditional (Sedley 1977, 102).</p>

<h2 id="Onto">4. Ontology</h2>

<h3 id="SimpAtom">4.1 Simples and &lsquo;atomism&rsquo;</h3>

<p>
Simples are the basic constituents of of bodies, time, and space are
&lsquo;simples&rsquo; (<em>amer&#275;</em>) (D&ouml;ring 117F,
D&ouml;ring 120). Diodorus used the term amer&#275; in his ontology
(D&ouml;ring 116). Diodorean simples are physically indivisible and
metaphysically simple, in that it is not possible to divide them. In
contrast, Epicurus held that atoms are physically indivisible, but
could be divided into &lsquo;conceptual&rsquo; parts, such as a top
and a bottom. Diodorus denied that simples have such conceptual parts
(Sedley 1977, 87; Denyer 1981a, 36&ndash;37; D&ouml;ring 119; see also
D&ouml;ring 117A; D&ouml;ring 117C; D&ouml;ring 117D; D&ouml;ring
117E). Diodorus holds that there are partless minima of time and
minima of space (D&ouml;ring 120; Sextus <em>M</em>10,119). The
consensus is now that Diodorus is committed to atomism about time
(Denyer 1981a, 36&ndash;37; Muller 1988, 138; and Berryman 2016), but
this is rejected by Wehrli (1960, 5:63) and McKirahan (1979, 242).</p>

<p>
Diodorean simples have location but also extension. Diodorus&rsquo;
simples are &lsquo;very small&rsquo; (D&ouml;ring 117A; D&ouml;ring
117C; D&ouml;ring 117D; D&ouml;ring 117E). Being small implies being
extended. Likewise, simple spaces lack parts, but have extension.
Several of Diodorus&rsquo; arguments assume simple spaces precisely
the same size as simple bodies. If simple bodies are extended, so too
are simple spaces. Finally, simple times lack parts, but have duration
(Sorabji 1983, 19). Although they lack parts, Diodorean simples have
other properties, such as being &lsquo;imperceptible&rsquo;
(D&ouml;ring 119). Diodorean simples have relational properties. A
simple body occupies a simple space just in case the simple body is
spatially located at that simple place. Likewise, a simple body exists
at a simple time just in case the simple body is temporally located at
that simple time. Simple places can relate to each other. For example,
places can be ordered from first to second, and the same applies to
simple times. This point is stressed by (Sorabji 1983, 369&ndash;70;
Sextus <em>M</em>10,119&ndash;20). Finally, simples can form
complexes. In fact, they are the principles (<em>archai</em>) of
complexes (D&ouml;ring 116; D&ouml;ring 117A; D&ouml;ring 117C;
D&ouml;ring 117D; D&ouml;ring 117E; D&ouml;ring 117F).</p>

<h3 id="MotiForAtom">4.2 Motivation for atomism</h3>

<p>
What might have motivated Diodorean atomism? No Diodorean argument for
atomism is recorded so the debate is speculative, but interesting,
since it shows how different parts of Diodorus thinking could be
connected. Mau (1954, 28) and Sedley (1977, 88) both suggest that
Diodorus could frame an argument for atomism using his definition of
possibility. Such an argument would work like this:</p>

<p>
However, Denyer rejects this as a reconstruction of Diodorus
motivation (Denyer 1981a, 35&ndash;36). The atomism that results from
the above argument is not Diodorean atomism, since it allows simples
that are of different sizes. Suppose that you have two objects of
different sizes at the last moment of time. Neither will be further
divided. So, both are simples. But, by hypothesis, each has a
different size. But, according to Denyer, Diodorean simples are not
only small, but also all have the same size. If two simples had
different sizes, one would be equal in size to a part of the other.
But this is not allowed, since neither have parts. So, all simples
have the same size.</p>

<p>
Several responses are open to this. The first is that Diodorus only
relies dialectically on bodies and spaces having the same size in his
anti-change argument (see below). So he does not need to commit to all
simple bodies having the same size. Second, it may be plausible that
all simple bodies do have the same very small size, even on the above
argument. Grains of sand on a beach, through a long process of
erosion, are all small and roughly of the same size and shape. Given
an arbitrarily long time, erosion would create arbitrarily small
grains of arbitrarily similar size and shape. On some interpretations,
Diodorus&rsquo; Master Argument needs an assumption that there is no
first moment of time (Denyer, 1999). Roughly, if there were a first
moment, at that moment, there are no past truths, including necessary
past truths. So (MA1) would be false. But if there is no first moment
of time, there is an arbitrarily long time for erosion to occur. So we
have an indefinitely long time for such physical processes to act on
all bodies. Denyer himself holds that Diodorean atomism is established
by Diodorus arguments against motion and change (Denyer 1981a, 33).
But, since those arguments rely extensively on atomism, it is unclear
whether these arguments could motivate atomism without begging the
question.</p>

<h3 id="ArguAgaiPresChan">5.1 Arguments against present change</h3>

<p>
Diodorus&rsquo; atomism was instrumental in his arguments about
change, but Diodorus attitude towards change was sophisticated.
Diodorus denied that there is change in the present, but not that
there was change in the past (D&ouml;ring 121; D&ouml;ring 122;
D&ouml;ring 123). Some have thought this position is incoherent, since
past change entails present change at some time, an objection we will
consider below. For now, consider how Diodorus defended the claim that
there is no present change.</p>

<p>
The traditional scholarly narrative has been that Diodorus responds to
Zeno of Elea&rsquo;s arguments, perhaps positing simples as a response
to the Dichotomy paradox, but then arguing that, even in that case,
motion is impossible (Sedley 1977, 85&ndash;86; Denyer 1981a, 40, 43;
Sorabji 1983, 18, 369; and Muller 1985, 137). More recent scholarship
has tried to show that Diodorus rejected not only motion but also
present qualitative and existential change for both simples and
complexes (Duncombe 2023). A few examples should give a flavour of
Diodorus strategy, which involves using his atomism to support his
anti-change arguments. Here is an argument against present change of
simples, attributed to Diodorus by Sextus Empiricus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For the partless body must be surrounded in a partless place, and it
moves (<em>kin&#275;tai</em>) neither in that place (for it fills it,
and it is necessary that a thing which will move has a place larger
than it), nor a place that it is not in. For it [the body] is not yet
in that place in order that it [the body] might move in it [the
place]. Thus it does not move (Sextus, <em>M</em>10,86 = D&ouml;ring
123 (part); my translation drawing on Bury).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Sextus reports reasoning of this sort:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em indent">
<dt>P1.</dt>
<dd>Every simple body occupies a simple place [Premise]</dd>
<dt>P2.</dt>
<dd>Any simple body that moves, moves either (a) in a place it
occupies or (b) in a place it does not occupy [Premise]</dd>
<dt>P3.</dt>
<dd>If a simple body moves, it moves in a place larger than it
[Premise]</dd>
<dt>P4.</dt>
<dd>If a body and the place it occupies are simple, both are the same
size [Premise]</dd>
<dt>C1.</dt>
<dd>So, no simple body moves in the place it occupies [MP P3,P4]</dd>
<dt>P5.</dt>
<dd>No simple body moves in a place it does not occupy [Premise]</dd>
<dt>C2.</dt>
<dd>Therefore, no simple body moves. [MT, P2,C1,P5]</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Diodorus&rsquo; argument is valid, but premises 2, 3 and 4 seem false.
Premise 2 seems false because it is not exhaustive: a body may move
from a place it occupies to a place it does not occupy. But appealing
to his atomism, Diodorus could defend the premise. Moving from one
place to another implies being partly in one place and partly in
another in one moment. But since neither bodies, times or places have
parts according to Diodorus, nothing can be partly in another at some
moment. Premise 3 seems false because it seems rotary motion can take
place in a place precisely the same size as the thing rotating. But,
as Diodorus could argue, rotation depends on parts because the
rotating thing has a vertical axis and some point which rotates around
the vertical axis. But these would be separate parts to the rotating
thing, which is blocked by Diodorus atomism. Finally, premise 4 seems
doubtful: why should both simple body and simple place be the same
size? (Denyer 1981a, 36) offers an ingenious argument that all simples
are the same size. Suppose for reductio that two partless simples,
\(a\), and \(b\), differ in size. In that case one must be larger than
the other, say \(a\) is larger than \(b\). But if \(a\) is larger than
\(b, b\) is the same size of a part of \(a\). So \(a\) has parts. But
this contradicts our supposition.</p>

<p>
Diodorus deployed a slightly different strategy against existential
change:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
And the fact that nothing perishes follows from the fact that nothing
changes (<em>kineisthai</em>). For just as nothing changes
(<em>kineitai</em>) in the place where it is not, so too the living
being dies neither in the time when it lives nor in the time when it
does not live, so it never dies. (Sextus, <em>M</em>1, 312=D&ouml;ring
128 (part))</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This line of argument shifts to a slightly different strategy.
Diodorus&rsquo; argument against movement argues that there is no
movement because there is no place for movement to take place. This
argument against existential change is that things cannot perish or
die because there is no time when existential change can take place.
The argument reported by Sextus runs like this:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em indent">
<dt>P1.</dt>
<dd>Anything that dies, either (a) dies at a time when that thing
lives or (b) at a time when it does not live [Premise]</dd>
<dt>P2.</dt>
<dd>Nothing dies at a time when it lives [Premise]</dd>
<dt>P3.</dt>
<dd>Nothing dies at a time when it does not live [Premise]</dd>
<dt>C1.</dt>
<dd>Nothing dies at a time when it lives nor at a time when it does
not live [&amp;, P2,P3]</dd>
<dt>C2.</dt>
<dd>So, nothing dies [MT on P1,C1]</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This style of argument also relies on Diodorus&rsquo; atomism.
&lsquo;Dies&rsquo; could mean (a) being in the process of dying (b)
the result of that process. If we take a process reading, of course,
something can be in the process of dying at a time when it lives, so
premise (2) is false. If we take the result reading, anything that
dies, dies at a time it does not live, since the first moment of being
dead is the first moment of not being alive. But Diodorus&rsquo;
atomism collapses this distinction, since if time is atomic there is
no continuous process of dying, merely a series of moments, the last
of which is the last moment of being alive.</p>

<p>
These arguments against change of simples do not rule out change of
complexes, since even if simples cannot change, it does not follow
that wholes composed of complexes cannot change. Wholes may have
properties their parts do not have. So Diodorus needs another argument
against change for complexes. We have a detailed report of such an
argument in Sextus (<em>M</em> 10, 114&ndash;17), known as the
Predominance Argument. Diodorus did not simply argue that
&lsquo;simples cannot change; complexes are just unstructured bundles
of simples; so, complexes cannot change&rsquo;. He attempted a more
ambitious argument that a whole cannot change because change cannot
&lsquo;transmit&rsquo; from parts to the whole. But it is difficult to
make the argument intelligible and even remotely compelling (see
(Hankinson 2015) and (Duncombe 2023) for differing attempts to make
sense of this argument).</p>

<p>
The overall argument says that for a whole to change, it must change
all-out. But all-out change is impossible. So, a whole cannot change.
Why is all-out change impossible? All out change is change of all the
parts. It is impossible because all-out change entails predominant
change, that is, change of most of the parts. But predominant change
is impossible. Predominant change occurs when more than half of the
parts are changing, but a few are resting. Diodorus subjects
predominant change to a Sorites-style or little-by-little
argument.</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em indent">
<dt>P1.</dt>
<dd>A body changes by predominance iff more than half its parts are
changing and less than half its parts are unchanging [Premise]</dd>
<dt>P2.</dt>
<dd>Suppose there is a body, \(a_1\), of 2 changing and 1 unchanging
parts</dd>
<dt>C1.</dt>
<dd>\(a_1\) changes by predominance [From P1 and P2]</dd>
<dt>P3.</dt>
<dd>For any \(x\), if \(x\) is a body of \(n\) parts changes by
predominance and one part is added to \(x\), the body still changes by
predominance [Premise]</dd>
<dt>P4.</dt>
<dd>\(a_2\) is \(a_1\) with one unchanging part added [Premise]</dd>
<dt>C2.</dt>
<dd>\(a_2\) changes by predominance [From P4 and P5]</dd>
<dt>C3.</dt>
<dd>A body \(n\) with 2 changing and \(n\) unchanging parts changes by
predominance [Reiteration P4-C2]</dd>
</dl>

<p>
But now say, \(n= 9998\), we have \(a9998\), a body that changes by
predominance, but where far less than half of its parts change. Which
contradicts P1. So predominant change is impossible. Since predominant
change is necessary for all-out change, all out change is also
impossible. One example Sextus gives, which may well have been
Diodorus&rsquo; own, was a greying beard. Another example might be a
spinning top with a two part rotating flywheel and a one part
non-rotating stem. Adding parts to the stem will not stop the top
rotating, but eventually it seems absurd to say that the top is
rotating by predominance.</p>

<p>
It is hard not to agree with Sedley that this is one of
Diodorus&rsquo; &lsquo;feebler efforts&rsquo; (Sedley 1977, 92). As
Sextus points out (<em>M</em> 10, 118) the Sorites-style argument can
barely start, since with the addition of one non-moving part, there
are two moving and two non-moving parts and so P4 is false, and that
must be because P3 is false too. What&rsquo;s more, it is hard to see
why predominant change precedes all-out change. One approach to this
question distinguishes the transitive and intransitive senses of
&lsquo;changes&rsquo;. There is a sense of &lsquo;unchanging&rsquo;
which is the opposite of the transitive &lsquo;\(a\) changes
\(b\)&rsquo;. That is, &lsquo;\(a\) is unchanging&rsquo; would mean
&lsquo;a is not changing something else (but could itself be changed).
Opposite to the intransitive &lsquo;\(a\) changes&rsquo; would be
&lsquo;\(a\) is not itself changing&rsquo;. Diodorus could answer
Sextus objection if we take the first sense of unchanging to be at
stake throughout the argument. A two-part body with two parts changing
something else and one not changing anything else, but open to being
changed, is changing by predominance. It has, as it were, two changing
parts and one &lsquo;free rider&rsquo; not contributing to the change,
but not inhibiting it either. Adding further free riders will not
inhibit the change. But still, it seems absurd to say that a body
composed of 9998 free riders not contributing to the change and two
doing all the changing, is changing by predominance.</p>

<p>
This is perhaps the earliest Sorities or little-by-little argument
recorded. The little-by-little strategy was deployed originally with
&lsquo;changes&rsquo;, which is not usually considered a vague
predicate, and which makes the argumentative strategy limited in
power. But whatever the merits of this style of argument, we can see
that Diodorus rejects change quite broadly, not only movement of
simples, but also existential change and qualitative change, for
simples and complexes. But all of his arguments target present change,
and several rely on the indivisibility of the present moment.</p>

<h3 id="TrutAbouPastChan">5.2 Truths about past change</h3>

<p>
Although Diodorus argues against present change, he accepted that
there are some past truths about change:</p>

<blockquote>
But according to reason it [sc. the body] has changed
[<em>kekin&#275;tai</em>]. For that which is earlier observed in a
certain place is now observed in another place; precisely what would
not have come about unless it [the body] had changed
(<em>kin&#275;thentos</em>). (D&ouml;ring 123 (part))
</blockquote>

<p>
The argument seems valid:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em indent">
<dt>P1.</dt>
<dd>For a body \(a\), if \((a\) has occupied some place \(y)\) and
\((a\) occupies some place \(z)\), then \(a\) has moved [Premise]</dd>
<dt>P2.</dt>
<dd>\(a\) has occupied place \(y\) [Premise]</dd>
<dt>P3.</dt>
<dd>\(a\) occupies place \(z\) [Premise]</dd>
<dt>C1.</dt>
<dd>So, \(a\) has moved [MP on P1&ndash;P3]</dd>
</dl>

<p>
But Sextus thinks that something has gone wrong, since each past tense
proposition entails the truth of the corresponding present tense
proposition (<em>M</em>10, 91&ndash;2).</p>

<dl class="partag">
<dt><em>Sextus&rsquo; Thesis.</em></dt>
<dd>If it has been the case that \(p\) then it is the case that \(p\)
at some earlier time.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Plausible as this principle might seem, there are various
counterexamples. One class of counterexamples include temporal
duration in the past, such as &lsquo;The Peloponnesian War lasted 27
years&rsquo;, but there is no time at which &lsquo;the Peloponnesian
War is lasting 27 years&rsquo;. Diodorus, of course, needs
counterexamples that involve change in the past, and gives a class of
counterexamples that involve successive relations and relational
change. (H) &lsquo;Helen had three husbands&rsquo; is a past truth but
does not entail that &lsquo;Helen has three husbands&rsquo; was at
some time true. Helen had a succession of husbands, not three at the
same time. That is, Helen was a serial monogamist not a polygamist.
There is some present tense proposition that (H) corresponds to,
namely, &lsquo;there are three men, such that Helen married the first,
then later the second, then later the third&rsquo;. But this
proposition is not a problem for Diodorus, since it is not a present
truth about change, but rather a present proposition about what
exists, namely, three men that bore a relation to Helen. This
solution, of course, coheres well with Diodorus atomism and views
about change. On Diodorus&rsquo; view it is true that &lsquo;Achilles
moved&rsquo;, but never true that &lsquo;Achilles is moving&rsquo;.
That is, Achilles bears different relations to different places at
different times, but there is no time at which Achilles is moving from
one to the other. But what is now true is that there are two places
such that Achilles occupied each. Similarly, Helen bears different
relations to different men at different times, but there is no time
when she bears the relation to all three of them. All that is now true
is that there are three men, such that Helen married each.</p>

<h2 id="PhilLang">6. Philosophy of Language</h2>

<h3 id="AmbiMeanPara">6.1 Ambiguity, Meaning and Paradox</h3>

<p>
Ambiguity had seemed like a threat to making epistemic progress using
dialectic for Plato and the first generation of Socratics
(<em>Phaedrus</em> 237b-c; Antisthenes 151 = DL 6.3; Antisthenes 160 =
Epictetus <em>Diss</em>. 1.17.10&ndash;12), and for a philosopher who
made dialectic a specialism, reflection on ambiguity would be crucial.
The basic worry was that two agents engaged in dialectic might simply
mean different things by the same term, and so would fail even to
contradict one another. For example, if we are arguing over whether
Socrates is virtuous, we need to know whether &lsquo;Socrates&rsquo;
refers to this historical Socrates, Plato&rsquo;s Socrates or
Xenophon&rsquo;s Socrates. If you hold that &lsquo;Socrates is
virtuous&rsquo; and I hold that &lsquo;Socrates is not
virtuous&rsquo;, unless we refer to the same individual, we have not
even contradicted each other.</p>

<p>
Diodorus is sometimes attributed a &lsquo;Humpty Dumpty&rsquo; view of
language, where &lsquo;words mean what I take them to mean&rsquo;
(Nawar 2021, 610 cites Ammonius <em>In De Int.</em> 38.17&ndash;22;
Simplicius <em>In Cat</em>. 27.18&ndash;21), but the evidence suggests
that Diodorus is only committed to something weaker, namely, that no
term is ambiguous, that is no term has more than one meaning (cf.
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Categories</em> 1a1&ndash;15 and Atherton 1993,
153). &lsquo;Kid&rsquo; can mean an immature goat or a young human.
Here we get a sketch of Diodorus&rsquo; reasoning in (D&ouml;ring
111). The text distinguishes three claims:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(A1)</dt>
<dd>No word is ambiguous (i.e. each word has at most one
meaning).</dd>
<dt>(A2)</dt>
<dd>No one says or thinks anything ambiguous (i.e. each thought picks
out at most one thing).</dd>
<dt>(A3)</dt>
<dd>Each person says precisely what they think they say (i.e. each
thought precisely expresses speaker intentions).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
(A2) and (A3) are premises for (A1). It is unclear whether singular
terms and singular thoughts are at stake here, or whether Diodorus had
in mind whole statements. But just working through with statements and
thoughts the argument seems to go like this:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em indent">
<dt>P1.</dt>
<dd>Suppose that I say &lsquo;a kid has four legs&rsquo; but intend
&lsquo;a young goat has four legs&rsquo;</dd>
<dt>P2.</dt>
<dd>If &lsquo;kid&rsquo; is ambiguous, I said two things: &lsquo;a
young human has four legs&rsquo; and &lsquo;a young goat has four
legs&rsquo; [P1 and definition of ambiguity]</dd>
<dt>P3.</dt>
<dd>But I said precisely what I intended, i.e. &lsquo;a young human
has four legs&rsquo; [P1 and A3]</dd>
<dt>C1.</dt>
<dd>So, I said at most one thing i.e. &lsquo;a young human has four
legs&rsquo; [from P3, i.e. A2]</dd>
<dt>C2.</dt>
<dd>So, &lsquo;kid&rsquo; is not ambiguous [MT C1, P2]</dd>
</dl>

<p>
There are a few observations to make about this argument. The first
obvious question is about whether (A2) is true. Why can a thought not
be ambiguous? Why, for example, can it not simply be that if I think
&lsquo;a kid has four legs&rsquo; it is indeterminate which of two
thoughts I&rsquo;m thinking. If thoughts can be indeterminate, then
speaker intentions can be too, and so terms can be ambiguous. This
sort of worry goes back at least as far as Plato&rsquo;s
<em>Theaetetus</em> 209b-c. The answer may have to do with the fact
that to have a successful thought at all, it seems to need to be
determinate, because it needs to be about one thing, rather than
another. But in that case, why can I not be wrong about what I&rsquo;m
thinking about?</p>

<p>
Another point here is that P2 claims that I said two things, not that
I thought two things. This suggests a philosophy of language in which
words connect to the world via propositions rather than thoughts. If
some term is ambiguous, sentences that use the term express several
propositions. But A3 appears to reject this picture, making the
intentions of the speaker trump objective meanings. </p>

<p>
Is (A3) true? There seem to be cases where I can say something which I
do not intend. Suppose I say &lsquo;a philosopher is the largest
person in the agora&rsquo;, intending to pick out Socrates. Unbeknown
to me, Phaedo is also in the agora, and Phaedo, a philosopher, is
taller than Socrates. Arguably, I have said a truth, about Phaedo,
that I did not intend to say. One way to render this more plausible
would be to say that speaker meaning is decisive in determining
meaning: speaker meaning in roughly the Gricean sense that the meaning
is a matter of a speaker intending to induce a psychological state in
the hearer. Maybe this is what is going on with Diodorus. But there
are reason to be sceptical about that. For one thing, Diodorus seems
to hold that statements express thoughts, and the thoughts determine
what the sentence says. And second there is no clear reason to think
that Diodorus intends to produce some belief in the hearer, rather
than just express something. It seems that Diodorus takes a radically
internalist view of meaning. What I say does not depend at all on
external factors about the world. That seems in keeping with the
evidence we have about naming, which looks like it assumes speaker
intentions are sufficient to fix names.</p>

<h3 id="DiodNami">6.2 Diodorus on naming</h3>

<p>
Diodorus is sometimes thought to have a radical conventionalism about
naming, where not only are all names merely conventional labels for
what they name, but also speaker intentions are sufficient to fix that
convention. Roughly this would be because Diodorus holds that meaning
is speaker meaning and meaning wholly fixes denotation.</p>

<p>
Several sources report that Diodorus named his slaves after logical
particles, roughly translated as &lsquo;However&rsquo;, &lsquo;On The
One Hand&rsquo; and &lsquo;On The Other Hand&rsquo; (D&ouml;ring
112&ndash;115). These were the standard terms for introducing premises
in dialectical arguments. Since antiquity this has been seen as
evidence of Diodorus&rsquo; radical conventionalism about naming. He
also gave one of his daughters, Theognis, a masculine name
(D&ouml;ring 101).</p>

<p>
Simplicius (D&ouml;ring 113) and Ammonius (D&ouml;ring 112) give us
some information about the debate into which Diodorus inserted his
examples. It seems that the question was whether some terms have a
purely formal linguistic role. &lsquo;However&rsquo; presumably was a
putative example of a non-referring expression, with a purely formal
role of introducing a second premise in an argument. Diodorus made
&lsquo;however&rsquo; into a referring expression (of course, this is
not really a counterexample, since just because I can use a term as a
referring expression it does not follow that it naturally is a
referring expression). But in any case, we know that there was an
ancient debate about whether the genders of nouns are natural or not,
dating at least as far back as Protagoras (Aristotle <em>Rhetoric</em>
3.5. 1407b7&ndash;8 = DK A27 = LM D23; Aristotle, <em>Sophistical
Refutations</em> 14, 173b17&ndash;22 = DKA28 = LM D24. Cf.
Aristophanes <em>Clouds</em> 658ff. Thanks to Nicholas Denyer for
drawing my attention to these sources). Diodorus&rsquo; presumably
named one of his daughters Theognis in a similar way, to give a
counterexample to the claim that nouns have natural genders. If, after
all, we can apply a masculine name to a female person, then the gender
of the noun cannot be natural. (But again, this seems not to be an
on-target counterexample, since the naturalist will simply say that
you have used the name <em>incorrectly</em>).</p>

<h3 id="Para">6.3 Paradoxes</h3>

<p>
Most modern scholarship credits the discovery of the Veiled Paradox
and the Horns Paradox to Eubulides (based on DL 2 108). However,
Diogenes does not say that Eubulides invented these paradoxes, merely
that he posed them. In fact, Diodorus invented the Veiled Paradox and
the Horns Paradox: &ldquo;Diodorus &hellip; was thought by some to
have invented the Veiled Man and Horns arguments&rdquo; (DL 2
111,translation Mensch). This piece of evidence has been overlooked.
But even if we credit Eubulides with the invention of these paradoxes,
it seems likely that these were especially associated with Diodorus.
It is puzzling why Diodorus might invent these two, which are not the
most philosophically interesting, at least compared with the Liar and
the Sorites. But the Veiled and Horns pose a particular threat to
question-and-answer dialectic.</p>

<p>
You might think that each dialectical question should be answerable
with at least one of &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no&rsquo;. This is
comparable to the Principle of the Excluded Middle. Dialectical
portions of Plato&rsquo;s dialogues present Socratic dialectic this
way. However, the Horns seems to show that not every question has a
simple &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no&rsquo; answer. The Horns paradox
sketched at (DL VII, 187) probably went something like this. The
questioner asks: &lsquo;Have you lost your horns?&rsquo;. If the
answerer replies &lsquo;yes&rsquo;, that implies an absurdity, namely,
that the answerer had horns. If the answerer replies &lsquo;no&rsquo;,
that also implies an absurdity, namely, that the answerer has horns.
But from either answer, an absurdity follows. And not just an
absurdity: having horns was an insult implying cuckoldry. The question
does not have a non-absurd yes-or-no response, because the question
makes a false presupposition, namely, that the answerer had horns.</p>

<p>
On the other hand, you might think that each dialectical question
should be answerable with at most one of &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or
&lsquo;no&rsquo;. This is comparable to the Principle of
Non-Contradiction. But the Veiled seems to show that some questions
should be answered both &lsquo;yes&rsquo; and &lsquo;no&rsquo;. The
Veiled argument probably went like this (Lucian, <em>Philosophers for
Sale</em> 22 = LS 37L). The questioner asks: &lsquo;Do you know your
own father? The answerer replies, &lsquo;yes&rsquo;. The answerer then
asks, &lsquo;Do you know this veiled person?&rsquo;. The answerer
replies &lsquo;no&rsquo;. &lsquo;But&rsquo;, says the questioner,
&lsquo;this person is your father. So, you both know and do not know
your father&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Diodorus&rsquo; views on ambiguity could be seen in the context of the
threat these paradoxes posed to Socratic dialectic. If no term in
dialectic is ambiguous because each sentence precisely expresses the
speakers&rsquo; meaning, neither paradox can get a grip. The Veiled
paradox trades on the fact that two different terms, &lsquo;your
father&rsquo; and &lsquo;this veiled man&rsquo;, both mean your
father. But, according to Diodorus theory, each term means precisely
one thing, the thing the speaker intends. So, on Diodorus&rsquo;
theory &lsquo;your father&rsquo; and &lsquo;this veiled man&rsquo;
either (a) do not mean the same thing, or (b) the answerer already
intends both to refer to their father. But in either case, the paradox
is blocked. Likewise, with the Horns paradox, the sentence &lsquo;Have
you lost your horns?&rsquo; trades on the sentence presupposing two
different propositions: &lsquo;You had horns&rsquo; and &lsquo;you
have lost them&rsquo;. But, on Diodorus&rsquo; theory, each sentence
expresses precisely one proposition. This would block questions which
have false suppositions, like the Horns question.</p>

<h2 id="Conc">7. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
Scholars have tended to see parts of Diodorus as influential on the
Hellenistic schools, especially Stoic logic and fatalism, and possibly
also Epicurean atomism. Sometimes he is seen as forming a bridge from
Aristotelian to post-Classical philosophy. But the tendency has been
to think of Diodorus as engaged in a largely negative enterprise,
dialectical in the sense that it took premises accepted by his
opponents and derived conclusions unacceptable to his opponents. If
his arguments were influential, it was because of their negative
impact. But looking synoptically at the evidence, we can certainly see
a coherent world view, supported by structured arguments. The Master
Argument supports an anti-Aristotelian view of modality (although see
<em>De Caelo</em> 1, 11&ndash;12 for a view of modality similar to
Diodorus&rsquo;), in the spirit of a Megaric suspicion of unactualized
possibilities. This modal system, in turn, supports a view about fate
and even a certain atomism. That atomism, in turn, supports a view
about present change being impossible, but past change being possible.
Diodorus&rsquo; reflections on meaning and naming support a defence of
the possibility of dialectic for getting to truths. Thus scholars are
right to think of Diodorus as a dialectician not for familiar reasons
that he was interested in logic, or practiced philosophy through
discussion and argued from the assumptions of his opponents, but
because he espoused a set of substantive views associated with the
Dialectical School.</p>

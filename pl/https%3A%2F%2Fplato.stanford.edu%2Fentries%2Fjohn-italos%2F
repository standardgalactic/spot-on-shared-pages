<h1>John Italos</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon May 13, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
John Italos (fl. 1070s) was a prominent and controversial intellectual
figure in eleventh-century Byzantium. An immigrant from Byzantine
Italy, he made a stellar career in Constantinople succeeding Michael
Psellos as head of the imperially sponsored school of philosophy. His
dialectical method and combative temper made him a renowned figure in
the Eastern Mediterranean. Among his students counted the future
Constantinopolitan elite as well as foreigners from the Latin West,
the Near East, and the Caucasus. His meteoric rise and Platonic
teachings gained him not only admiration but also fierce opposition,
which led to his repeated investigation in 1076/77 and 1082.
Ultimately, an ecclesiastical synod condemned him for heterodoxy in
1082 and forced him to retire from public life. Italos&rsquo; legacy
is a contested one. He has been seen as a staunch heretic by those who
accept the condemnation at face value and as a Socratic free-thinker
by those who see him as a victim of political intrigue. The debate
over the significance of his condemnation has dominated the study of
Italos and has decisively shaped the reconstruction of his
teachings.</p>

<h2 id="LifeWork">1. Life and Work</h2>

<p>
Our knowledge of Italos&rsquo; life rests largely on the account of
Anna Komn&#275;n&#275;, who describes his origin and character in her
<em>Alexiad</em> (V.8&ndash;9), which was written in hindsight in the
1140s. She gives an overtly hostile account of the philosopher and
presents him as the exact opposite of what an acculturated Byzantine
was supposed to be (Arabatzis 2002). Notwithstanding her bias,
Komn&#275;n&#275;&rsquo;s account relates the key milestones of
Italos&rsquo; life, with the exception of his dates of birth and
death, which are unknown. Italos was probably born in southern Italy
in c. 1030, at a time when the region was still under Byzantine
control. He spent his formative years in the company of his father,
who was a soldier. As a battle-hardened youth, who had undergone some
kind of elementary education, Italos moved to Constantinople around
1050, possibly as a refugee. In the capital he received a literary
education and joined the circle of the polymath Michael Psellos.
Psellos praised Italos&rsquo; forceful use of argumentation, which
compensated for his lack of linguistic elegance (<em>Or. min.</em>
19). Elsewhere (<em>Or. min.</em> 18), he reprimanded his
student&rsquo;s utilitarian approach, which aided his dialectical
exploration and profitable advancement but precluded him from properly
examining and teaching certain disciplines, such as geometry.</p>

<p>
Italos&rsquo; argumentative fervor earned him both praise and
criticism. His alleged temperament (cf. Hunger 1987, 38) and strict
argumentativeness endeared him to his students, who included members
of the ecclesiastical hierarchy and the imperial court. Due to his
political network and Italian provenance, he was sent on a diplomatic
mission to the Normans in the mid-1070s. During his mission, he was
accused of treason, whereupon he fled to Rome. He was pardoned shortly
thereafter by Emperor Michael VII and returned to Constantinople.
Around the year 1076, he succeeded Psellos as Consul of the
philosophers (hypatos t&#333;n philosoph&#333;n), i.e., as the head of
the school of philosophy. About this time, he was accused of
heterodoxy, but the emperor, whose patronage he enjoyed, intervened on
his behalf and ensured that he was acquitted. Yet the bad repute
stayed with Italos. Following the usurpation of Emperor Alexios I in
1081, Italos was put on trial again and was found guilty of heterodoxy
in March 1082. Most significantly, his dialectical method and his
Platonic teachings were judged objectionable. Thereafter, Italos
disappeared from the public sphere. Although there is some evidence
that suggests he may have been partially rehabilitated (Magdalino
1996, 23, cf. <em>Alexiad</em> V.9.7), he was never reinstated in his
teaching position.</p>

<p>
It stands to reason to assume that many of Italos&rsquo; writings were
destroyed following his condemnation. The practice of destroying the
works of the anathematized is documented in the case of Italos&rsquo;
student Eustratios of Nicaea (Joannou 1954, 378); however, we lack
such explicit information in Italos&rsquo; case. Be that as it may,
what has come down to us are his <em>Quaestiones quodlibetales</em>, a
variety of logical treatises (<em>De dialectica</em>, <em>De
syllogismis</em>, <em>In Aristotelis Topicorum commentaria</em>,
<em>Synopsis minor in Porphyrii Isagogem</em>), a manual on rhetorics
(<em>De rhetorica</em>), a few scholia on Pseudo-Dionsyius, and
&ndash; possibly &ndash; an apologetic letter addressed to the
Patriarch (<em>Epistula apologetica ad patriarcham</em>). The epistle
describes a situation that resembles Italos&rsquo; condemnation: the
author complains that he was convicted in an unfair trial, in which
his statements were deliberately distorted. Yet there are some
incongruities with what we know of Italos&rsquo; two trials, which
call into question its authenticity (Gouillard 1985a). Likewise, the
authenticity of the summary on Porphyry&rsquo;s <em>Isagoge</em>
(<em>Synopsis minor in Porphyrii Isagogem</em>) has been impugned
(Rigo 2001, 65). But its succinct style, the explicit attribution to
Italos in the manuscript tradition, and the preference for the
Aristotelian example of &ldquo;goat-stag&rdquo; (traghelaphos; a
fictional animal), which Italos employs also in <em>Qu</em> 3 and
<em>Qu</em> 28 (cf. Romano 1994), speak in favor of its authenticity.
The text briefly defines the five voices (genus, species, difference,
property, and accident &ndash; the universals distinguished by
Porphyry) and discusses their interrelationship (Romano 1992).
Probably also by Italos are the three scholia on the first chapter of
Ps-Dionysios&rsquo; <em>De Coelesti Hierarchia</em> that are contained
in a single Florentine manuscript (Laur. plut. V.13) (Rigo 2006). The
scholia point out &ndash; among other issues &ndash; that the
celestial hierarchy is an intelligible realm that is completely devoid
of matter and thus does not undergo generation and corruption.</p>

<p>
Italos&rsquo; undisputed writings include <em>De rhetorica</em>. It
has been shown that this work is not an actual summary of
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Rhetoric</em> but rather a compilation from
commentaries and prolegomena that were available to Italos (Conley
1998; 2004). In particular, it is remarkable that Italos does not
mention <em>enthym&#275;mata</em> (rhetorical demonstrations), which
indicates that he did not have first-hand knowledge of the
<em>Rhetoric</em>. Similarly, Italos&rsquo; commentary on books II-IV
of Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Topics</em> (<em>In Aristotelis Topicorum
commentaria</em>) does not offer an independent exposition of the
Aristotelian work but draws heavily on Alexander of Aphrodisias&rsquo;
commentary (Wallies 1891; Kotzabassi 1999). Italos&rsquo; interest in
the <em>Topics</em> is evident also in his <em>De dialectica</em> and
<em>De syllogismis</em>. In the former work he defines dialectics as
the intermediary between the demonstrative and sophistic arts. Its
purpose is to train the mind and to reason well &ndash; relying on
common beliefs (endoxa) &ndash; whenever demonstrative proof cannot be
given (&sect;6). By drawing consistently on Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Topics</em> and <em>Prior Analytics</em>, he offers an
introduction to Aristotelian dialectics and syllogistic, which he
dedicated to the co-emperor Andronikos Doukas. He continued his
introduction in <em>De syllogismis</em>, which starts by
distinguishing the matter (premises) from the form (figures) of
syllogisms. He goes on to differentiate ten kinds (topoi) to construct
syllogisms (&sect;7), which he discusses in detail
(&sect;&sect;8&ndash;32) before providing a synopsis of
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Topics</em> II-VI (&sect;&sect;33-89). The
logical treatises show Italos as an author who &ndash; much like
Aristotle &ndash; shunned redundancy, expressing himself succinctly to
the point of occasional obscurity. They also show him as a teacher who
composed epitomes for the courtly intelligentsia.</p>

<p>
Italos&rsquo; most important work is his <em>Quaestiones
quodlibetales</em> (<em>Questions and Answers</em> or
<em>&#7944;&pi;&omicron;&rho;&#943;&alpha;&iota; &kappa;&alpha;&#8054;
&lambda;&#973;&sigma;&epsilon;&iota;&sigmaf;</em>). It comprises a
collection of 93 aporetic chapters, in which Italos discusses various
issues related to logic, epistemology, ethics, physics, and theology.
The collection stands in the tradition of eleventh-/twelfth-century
er&#333;tapokriseis (e.g., Michael Psellos&rsquo; <em>De omnifaria
doctrina</em>, Syme&#333;n S&#275;th&rsquo;s <em>Conspectus rerum
naturalium</em>). &Iota;t was not compiled by Italos himself, given
that it contains spurious works (<em>Qu</em> 59) and lecture notes by
his students (<em>Qu</em> 44). Yet the bulk of the miscellany is
authentic. It contains references to Italos&rsquo; oral teachings
(e.g., <em>Qu</em> 63, 68) and a number of works dedicated to members
of the imperial court. <em>Qu</em> 43 was written in response to an
inquiry by co-emperor Andronikos Doukas regarding a Homeric passage
(Trizio 2013), <em>Qu</em> 50 instructs Emperor Michael VII on the
post-mortem fate of the soul, and <em>Qu</em> 71 proves to an
unspecified emperor (possibly Alexios I) that the world is not
everlasting. The work also contains a letter to an unspecified
Abkhazian grammarian (<em>Qu</em> 64), who may be identified with the
Georgian philosopher Ioane Petritsi (Kechagmadze 1967). The
<em>Quaestiones</em> comprise a miscellany whose compositional
technique and variegated contents remain to be studied.</p>

<h2 id="Teac">2. Teachings</h2>

<p>
Italos&rsquo; extant writings are mostly didactic treatises written
for his students. The esoteric nature of these writings explains in
part their succinct and unadorned style. Moreover, the treatises
presume the reader&rsquo;s familiarity not only with the school
curriculum but also with Italos&rsquo; own views. As has been noted,
it is difficult to reconstruct a philosophical system on the basis of
didactic epitomes and commentaries alone (St&eacute;phanou 1957, 433).
Notwithstanding this limitation, the <em>Quaestiones</em> are our best
source for piecing together Italos&rsquo; teachings. Supplementary
sources are the trial records, the <em>Synodikon</em> anathemas, the
<em>Alexiad</em>, and the <em>Timarion</em>. These sources provide
crucial testimonies, but they are hostile towards the philosopher and
must be taken <em>cum grano salis</em>. The reconstruction of
Italos&rsquo; teachings largely rests on one&rsquo;s decision about 1)
the reliability of those hostile accounts and 2) the trustworthiness
of Italos&rsquo; own statements. For instance, the <em>Alexiad</em>
and the <em>Synodikon</em> anathemas both claim that Italos taught the
transmigration of souls and the eternity of Platonic ideas, while
holding a blasphemous attitude towards the saints. However, these
views cannot be corroborated with Italos&rsquo; own statements, unless
one allows for some degree of distortion and/or dissimulation. One way
of making sense of the discrepancies between Italos&rsquo; writings
and later testimonies is to assume that Italos took part in an
intellectual struggle between two factions: on the one end stood
radical Hellenizers and, on the other, orthodox fundamentalists (e.g.,
the authors of the <em>Synodikon</em> anathemas). Italos represented a
middle position, which sought to harmonize Hellenic learning with the
Christian faith (Masai 1956, 292). Owing to his tightrope position, he
was vilified by extremists on both sides. The following exposition of
Italos&rsquo; teachings on logic, the cosmos, ethics, the soul, and
God reflects his coherent and eclectic Christian Platonism.</p>

<h3 id="Logi">2.1 Logic</h3>

<p>
The greater part of the <em>Quaestiones</em> discusses logic. In
<em>Qu</em> 7, Italos explains that substances (ousiai) are
authyparkta, that is, they are entities that exist on their own,
independently from accidents. He follows Michael Psellos in holding
that, on the one hand, substances are created beings and thus
dependent on divine causality, yet on the other hand, they are
autonomous entities with regard to accidents (Walter 2021). A
recurrent issue is the nature of universals. Italos follows the
Alexandrian tradition in assuming three modes of existence for
universals: they exist as separate entities prior to the particulars
(<em>ante res</em>, pro t&#333;n poll&#333;n), they exist together
with the particulars (<em>in rebus</em>, en tois pollois), and they
exist after the particulars as abstractions of the mind (<em>post
res</em>, epi tois pollois). The latter derive from the apprehension
of common characteristics in the particulars. Given that all
universals exist in the mind of God (<em>ante res</em>), their absence
from particulars (<em>in rebus</em>) precludes only their existence in
our mind (<em>post res</em>) and not their absolute non-existence.
This tripartite mode of being, which was championed by Ammonius
Hermiae (d. c. 526), was adopted by John Italos. In <em>Qu</em> 5,
Italos discusses the differences between those three kinds, noting
that universals (<em>ante res</em>) exist in God&rsquo;s mind and that
they are the paradigms of perceptible individuals. He remarks that
universals in the particulars (<em>in rebus</em>) are themselves
particulars. In <em>Qu</em> 58, he argues that universals are neither
corporeal nor incorporeal and, thus, are not beings (but mere
concepts). Elsewhere (<em>Qu</em> 3 &amp; 4), however, he demonstrates
that universals are incorporeal in nature and do belong among beings.
Universals are beings that subsist in something else (enhypostata,
<em>Qu</em> 19) &ndash; i.e., either in the particular and/or in the
mind. Italos&rsquo; repeated discussion of universals testifies to the
importance of the topic in the school curriculum and to his adherence
to the moderate (or conceptual) realism of the Alexandrian tradition
(Benakis 1982, 85; Ierodiakonou 2007; <em>pace</em> Joannou 1956b,
140&ndash;146).</p>

<h3 id="Cosm">2.2 Cosmology</h3>

<p>
Italos&rsquo; indebtedness to the Alexandrian tradition is also
apparent in his cosmology. In <em>Qu</em> 71, he sets out to
demonstrate the non-eternity of the world, drawing extensively on John
Philoponus. The issue whether the world is everlasting or created in
the beginning of time was hotly debated among pagan and Christian
philosophers of Late Antiquity. John Philoponus (d. c. 570) devoted a
number of works to the dispute, refuting the arguments by Aristotle,
Porphyry, and Proclus, who all had argued in favor of an everlasting
world. Following the sixth century, discussions over the world&rsquo;s
eternity became rare. The debate was revived in the eleventh century
in the Constantinopolitan school of philosophy. Italos contributed to
the revival with a treatise (<em>Qu</em> 71) that argues that the
current world will come to an end and be reconstituted at the
resurrection, whereby the world&rsquo;s form will guarantee its
identity (Kraft/Perczel 2018). Italos advances a two-fold
argumentation. His first approach is to refute Aristotelian and
Proclean arguments and to show that the cosmos must have been created
by God&rsquo;s arbitrary will rather than by divine nature. His
refutations manifestly draw on Philoponus (Byd&eacute;n 2013, 168).
One key argument holds that all matter is corruptible and that the
notion of an incorruptible matter (i.e., aether) entails a logical
contradiction, as two different kinds of matter (corruptible and
incorruptible) would require a formal distinction that cannot be
attributed to formless matter. In <em>Qu</em> 42, he examines what
Plato and Aristotle had to say about the heavens and, in particular,
about the fifth element (quintessence, aether). Italos takes a
classical reconciliatory approach, arguing that both philosophers were
in agreement regarding the body of the heavens: while Plato associated
the heavens with a fifth mathematical figure (dodecahedron), Aristotle
focused on the physical qualities of the heavens, from which he
inferred a fifth element (aether). Italos concludes that it makes no
difference whether one talks about a fifth figure (sch&#275;ma) or a
fifth element (stoixeion) (Mariev/Marchetto 2017, 57&ndash;62).
<em>Qu</em> 42 is a hermeneutical exercise and may not fully reflect
Italos&rsquo; personal view because, for him, all matter is equally
indefinite and inherently non-existent; it is privation, non-being,
and the cause of the decay in (and of) the world. Elsewhere
(<em>Qu</em> 92), Italos examined in detail the Plotinian and Proclean
views of matter. It has been argued that this discussion presents
another scholastic exercise, in which Italos opposes two prominent
Neoplatonic theories of matter and shows their inconsistency
(St&eacute;phanou 1949, 92; Trizio 2014). Thus, it is important to
keep in mind the argumentative strategy of a given treatise when
interpreting and decoding Italos&rsquo; contentions. In regard to
<em>Qu</em> 71, Italos&rsquo; strategy was to refute eternalist
arguments in order to uphold Christian morals. This is made explicit
in his second approach, which asserts that Christian piety
necessitates the belief in the end of the world. An everlasting world
would preclude the last judgment, which is foundational for Christian
piety and ethics.</p>

<h3 id="Ethi">2.3 Ethics</h3>

<p>
Italos taught a coherent theory on ethics. In <em>Qu</em> 63, he
differentiates between different types of virtues: natural virtues,
which animals possess and, thus, do not really count as virtues;
ethical virtues, which are the first human ones, as they require
reason; and higher forms of virtues, which are essential for the union
with the One. Italos draws on Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Nicomachean
Ethics</em> (Book II) and establishes that ethical virtues constitute
a mean between two extremes. Ethical virtues include the four cardinal
virtues: prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance. These virtues
do not constitute a capacity or passion but a habitual state (hexis),
which is attained through the use of the rational part of the soul.
Italos uses Plato&rsquo;s tripartite division of the soul into reason
(logismos), passion (thymos), and desire (epithymia)
(<em>Republic</em> 435c&ndash;441c) and the chariot allegory
(<em>Phaedrus</em> 246a&ndash;254e) to describe the leading role that
reason holds in acquiring virtues. In <em>Qu</em> 81, he integrates
his views on ethical virtues into the larger framework of the
Neoplatonic hierarchy of virtues. Accordingly, Italos identifies
Aristotle&rsquo;s ethical virtues with Plotinus&rsquo; political
virtues. The political (or civic) virtues are the lowest kinds of
(human) virtues and are superseded by the purgative, contemplative,
and paradigmatic virtues (cf. St&eacute;phanou 1949, 104&ndash;107).
Italos closely follows here Plotinus (<em>Enn</em>. I.2) and Porphyry
(<em>Sentences</em>, chap. 32) and notes that the notion that
political virtue is a mean between extremes does not apply to the
higher forms of virtue. By subsuming Aristotelian ethics into the
Neoplatonic hierarchy of virtues, Italos promotes a Neoplatonic
anthropology: humans are rational souls that seek to return to the
intelligible and incorporeal God. Ethical (or political) virtues apply
to mankind&rsquo;s current embodied existence, which forms a mere
transitory stage in the preparation of the soul&rsquo;s return
(O&rsquo;Meara 2021, 145). Thus, when expounding Christ&rsquo;s
injunction to turn the other cheek (Matt. 5:39) in <em>Qu</em> 77, he
argues that what Christ meant was to renounce the worldly duality
(hylik&#275; dyada) of opinion and reason, matter and form. Overcoming
the dualistic (or binary) condition of embodied souls &ndash; a result
of the Fall &ndash; is the ultimate goal of ethical training.</p>

<h3 id="Psyc">2.4 Psychology</h3>

<p>
The nature of the soul constitutes a key issue for Italos; he examined
it repeatedly (St&eacute;phanou 1933). As a Christian, he believed in
the immortality of the soul, but as a Platonist he had to qualify that
belief. In <em>Qu</em> 36, Italos contests Plato&rsquo;s arguments
that the soul is immortal because it is a self-moving
(<em>Phaedrus</em> 245c&ndash;246a) and life-giving (<em>Phaedo</em>
105c&ndash;e) principle. The soul&rsquo;s dependence on the body
necessitates its corruptibility. If anything in the soul is immortal
then it must be something that operates independently from the body.
The only such thing is the intellect. Italos endorses
Aristotle&rsquo;s argument that only the intellect is unaffected by
the body and thus incorruptible (<em>De Anima</em> III.5).
Accordingly, Italos holds that the intellect survives the body&rsquo;s
death while the other parts of the soul perish. Man is essentially
intellect (nous) &ndash; a conviction that he reiterates throughout
his writings. For instance, in <em>Qu</em> 50 he reaffirms that only
the intellectual part of the soul is immortal. When the rational part
of the soul detaches itself from the body at the moment of death it
loses its ability to undergo motion and change. Italos follows Proclus
(<em>Institutio theologica</em> &sect;191) in asserting that the
post-mortem soul becomes inactive. Thus, the dead cannot experience
any further progress (epidosis, anabasis), and even the deceased
saints cannot perform miracles. That is why, his opponents counted
Italos among the so-called &ldquo;deadsoulers&rdquo;
(thn&#275;topsychitai) (Gouillard 1976, 311&ndash;312;
Krausm&uuml;ller 2015, 11&ndash;15). But Italos concedes that divine
grace could, in theory, overcome this incapacity and assist the
deceased in their quest for the remission of sin. <em>Qu</em> 86
explores further the perennial issue of the fate of the soul by
questioning the identity of our post-resurrection selves with our
current selves. Italos argues that identity is a formal principle;
corporeality and matter do not play any part in it. After all, our
bodies are in constant change and thus cannot safeguard our identity.
Italos was well aware of the food-chain argument (<em>Qu</em> 71) and
thus rejected the assumption that the resurrection occurs in the very
bodies that we currently live in. He held that form (eidos) is the
only principle of identity (St&eacute;phanou 1949, 93; Shchukin 2010,
120). At the resurrection this form will be clothed anew in matter,
taking on better, less corruptible properties that render the
resurrected body a spiritual entity. Italos is consistent in asserting
that man&rsquo;s embodied nature is due to the Fall and that the
rational soul strives to return to its original, prelapsarian state as
intellect. Put differently, Italos promoted a Christian Platonist
(dubbed &ldquo;Origenist&rdquo;) psychology and eschatology that
postulated a spiritual resurrection and the soul&rsquo;s gradual
return to its intelligible, divine origin (Kraft 2021).</p>

<h3 id="Theo">2.5 Theology</h3>

<p>
Italos&rsquo; (Neo-)Platonism is apparent also in his theology. The
notions of the hierarchy of causes and of the great chain of being
permeate his writings. In <em>Qu</em> 51, when explaining solar
eclipses, he asserts that the primary cause of the natural phenomenon
is God the Creator, while the secondary cause is the moon that covers
the sun (Pontikos 1992, 91). In <em>Qu</em> 68, he gives an account of
the three divine hypostases (of the great chain of being) and their
triple movement of rest, procession, return (mon&#275;, proodos,
epistroph&#275;). He identifies the three hypostases with the Trinity,
which he makes clear by describing the second hypostasis (nous) in
Christological terms. He alludes to John 8:42, thereby equating the
second hypostasis with Christ. It is true that the treatise starts by
claiming that he merely expounds the teachings of &ldquo;the best
theologians among the pagans&rdquo;. Yet the scriptural reference and
the fact that he used the same terminology in his confession of faith,
as recorded in the trial records (Gouillard 1985b, 145.164&ndash;168),
prove that Italos gives an overview of his own theology in <em>Qu</em>
68 (cf. Shchukin 2008, 250; <em>pace</em> St&eacute;phanou 1949,
91).</p>

<p>
Another section of his confession of faith (Gouillard 1985b,
147.218&ndash;149.223) has been shown to be an adaptation of the
Ps-Athanasian (<em>Quicumque</em>) creed, which was commonly used
among the Latins (Grumel 1938). It contains subtle modifications that
were understood at the time as indicative of a heretical Trinitology.
According to one modern interpretation, Italos followed Philoponus in
holding that God&rsquo;s unity cannot lie on the level of secondary
substance (natures or universals) but only on the level of primary
substance (hypostases or concrete beings). Accordingly, God&rsquo;s
unity is a <em>hypostatic</em> function, which could be viewed as
Tritheism, i.e., the view that three separate divine hypostases exist.
This contradicts the standard Cappadocian formula, according to which
God&rsquo;s oneness is due the common divine substance (or nature) of
the three hypostases. Thus, Italos sought to counterbalance his
Tritheism with a Sabellian solution, merging the three hypostases into
one and emphasizing their hypostatic union (Krausm&uuml;ller 2016).
Conversely, it has also been argued that Italos&rsquo; application of
philosophical terms was in complete harmony with Christian Trinitology
(Joannou 1956b; Clucas 1981; Niarchos 1996, 250&ndash;258). Such an
apologetic reading, however, brushes aside many of Italos&rsquo; more
subtle remarks.</p>

<p>
Yet another passage of his credo (Gouillard 1985b, 153.315&ndash;316)
stipulates to &ldquo;worship&rdquo; (latreuein) the icon of Christ.
The unexpected choice of the word &ldquo;worship&rdquo; (latreia)
should not be seen as a slip of tongue. Italos probably had Heb. 8:5
in mind and held that icons are mere sensible shadows of the
intelligible archetype (Christ), which need to be transcended by
worshipping the archetype (Shchukin 2008). Elsewhere (<em>Qu</em> 87),
Italos chose to quote virtually verbatim from John of Damascus&rsquo;
first speech of his <em>Orationes de imaginibus tres</em>, which
explores the different meanings of images (Nikolaou 2012). That
paraphrase shows no indication that he deviated from orthodox icon
theology and may have served an apologetic purpose.</p>

<p>
Many such ambiguities emerge from Italos&rsquo; writings. His
stringent and succinct arguments, the dialectical style, and the
fragmentary and esoteric nature of his extant writings pose a
challenge to the modern reader. The difficulty to reconstruct
Italos&rsquo; thought is further compounded by the hostile testimonies
and by the reasonable assumption that he used at least some degree of
dissimulation (Siniossoglou 2011, 82&ndash;85; Kaldellis 2012,
141&ndash;142). In view of these difficulties, it is not surprising
that we still lack a reliable critical edition of the
<em>Quaestiones</em>, which distinguishes Italos&rsquo; genuine
writings from his students&rsquo; lecture notes, on the one hand, and
from spurious works, on the other. A comprehensive study of
Italos&rsquo; thought, which remains a desideratum, will also have to
examine his philosophical progeny, Eustratios of Nicaea and Ioane
Petritsi, who are important witnesses to the thought of Italos&rsquo;
school.</p>

<h2 id="CondAfte">3. Condemnation and afterlife</h2>

<p>
Italos&rsquo; teachings aroused considerable attention among his
contemporaries and were subject of repeated debates. His views were
investigated twice by ecclesiastical synods; first in 1076/77, when he
was acquitted, and again in 1082, when he was anathematized. The
latter trial was a major event at the time. We know about it not only
from narrative sources, i.e., Anna Komn&#275;n&#275; (Reinsch/Kambylis
2001, 165&ndash;167) and Nik&#275;tas Ch&#333;niat&#275;s (Tafel 1832,
2&ndash;3), but also from legal and liturgical documents, i.e., the
trial records (Gouillard 1985b) and the <em>Synodikon of
Orthodoxy</em> (Gouillard 1967, 57&ndash;61). The <em>Synodikon</em>
is a liturgical text that was originally composed in the ninth century
to commemorate the restoration of icon veneration at the end of the
iconoclast controversy. It was repeatedly updated starting from the
second half of the eleventh century, with the condemnations against
Italos marking the first major addition. The condemnations consist of
ten articles (an eleventh, personal condemnation is contained in some
manuscripts), which claim that Italos held divergent views on
cosmology, theology, and eschatology. It is unlikely that all the
accusations were baseless, although we have to assume that they
contain simplifications and distortions of Italos&rsquo; actual
views.</p>

<p>
A key approach to Italos&rsquo; philosophy is to compare the
condemnations with his extant writings (St&eacute;phanou 1933;
Gouillard 1967, 194&ndash;200; Clucas 1981; Shchukin 2010). Scholars
are in disagreement as to whether Italos did, in fact, deviate from
the orthodox norms of his day. It matters little in this respect that
Michael Psellos vouched for Italos&rsquo; orthodoxy (<em>Or. min.</em>
19). Those who accept the veracity of the ecclesiastical verdict see
Italos as a subversive philosopher, whose teachings and methods
challenged the orthodox establishment with crypto-pagan wisdom
(Nicolaidis 2011, 64&ndash;67; Siniossoglou 2011, 82&ndash;85). But
those who disagree with the verdict see him as a dialectician who
explored theological issues with philosophical methods without,
however, endorsing any heretical view (Joannou 1956b; Clucas 1981).
Accordingly, it was Italos&rsquo; philosophical methodology &ndash;
and not any particular doctrine &ndash; that motivated his
condemnation (St&eacute;phanou 1949, 117; Ierodiakonou 2007,
24&ndash;28; Gutas/Siniossoglou 2017, 290&ndash;291). Italos&rsquo;
legacy ranges from a subversive heretic to a Socratic free-thinker.
The large discrepancy in interpretation is in part due to the nature
of the sources (didactic treatises and hostile testimonies). In part,
it is due to the assumption that Italos&rsquo; command of the Greek
language was deficient and that he cannot be held fully accountable
for his statements (Gouillard 1976, 309; Clucas 1981, 40). It is true
that Anna Komn&#275;n&#275;, Michael Psellos, and the
<em>Timarion</em> all criticize Italos&rsquo; lack of rhetorical
eloquence, but this can hardly be taken as a justification of the
claim that Italos could not have fully understood the meaning of his
own propositions. In fact, the extant writings do not substantiate the
view that he did not know Greek proficiently. To be sure, there are
occasional textual difficulties, but these are probably due to scribal
errors rather than to any linguistic shortcomings of the author.</p>

<p>
While views depart on whether Italos actually held heterodox views,
there is virtual unanimity in scholarship that he was condemned, at
least in part, for political reasons. As head of the school of
philosophy, Italos enjoyed the direct patronage of the imperial court
under the Doukas dynasty (1059&ndash;1081). When Emperor Alexios I
usurped the throne in 1081, those connections became disadvantageous.
Italos was seen as a threat to the early rule of Alexios I. His
daughter, Anna Komn&#275;n&#275;, later recalled that Italos &ndash;
allegedly &ndash; incited his students to insurrection
(<em>Alexiad</em> V.9.4; Buckley 2014, 125&ndash;129). Other political
considerations, such as Italos&rsquo; Latin origin and the
emperor&rsquo;s intention to distract public attention from military
setbacks, certainly disfavored the philosopher&rsquo;s position.
Moreover, factional rivalry within the school of philosophy (Anastasi
1975, 531) and the tacit socio-economic implications of his Christian
Platonism (Kraft 2021) further contributed to his downfall, which
should be seen as the outcome of a confluence of several factors.</p>

<p>
Italos&rsquo; trial in 1082 has been presented as a watershed event
not only in Italos&rsquo; career but also in the history of science.
Accordingly, the condemnation is thought to have inhibited further
philosophical exploration of theology and cosmology and contributed to
the scientific decline in the Eastern Roman Empire (St&eacute;phanou
1949, 119&ndash;121; Browning 1975, 15; Clucas 1981, 172&ndash;177).
This view can be seen as an inverted mirror image of the &lsquo;Pierre
Duhem thesis&rsquo;, which argued that the Condemnation of 1277 in the
Latin West led to the development of modern science. But while the
&lsquo;Duhem thesis&rsquo; has been met with substantial criticism,
the thesis that Italos&rsquo; condemnation foreclosed scientific
development in Byzantium still awaits refutation.</p>

<p>
After the condemnation, Italos disappeared from the public sphere. Yet
his legacy was not immediately forgotten. The <em>Timarion</em>, a
Lucianic satire of the twelfth century, presents a fictitious
narrative in which Italos is rejected by ancient Greek philosophers in
Hades for his incorrigible &ldquo;Galilean&rdquo; (Christian) mindset.
He is also said to be hated by the Christians. Thus, the
<em>Timarion</em> depicts Italos as a heretic, who is repelled by both
ancient philosophers and contemporary Christians. With regard to the
transmission history of his works, we have about two dozen manuscripts
that transmit his writings. Two of the earliest manuscript copies date
to the thirteenth century and are of southern Italian provenance (Vat.
gr. 316 and Marc. gr. Z.265). It has been suggested that Nicholas of
Otranto (d. 1235) may have brought Italos&rsquo; works from Byzantium
to Italy (Romano 1988). No work has yet been done on the reception
history of Italos in late Byzantium and beyond, although heuristic
comparisons with the late Byzantine philosophers Barlaam the Calabrian
(Magdalino 2017) and Gemistos Pl&#275;th&#333;n (Siniossoglou 2011),
as well as with Ibn Rushd (Lauritzen 2007, 82) and the Renaissance
(Duj&#269;ev 1939) have been made. The impact Italos had on medieval
intellectual history, if any, still remains to be established. In
modern times, Italos does not seem to have been read until his
rediscovery by nineteenth-century Russian and Georgian scholars
(Uspenskiy 1893, 14&ndash;18, 46&ndash;67; Bezobrazov 1896; Cereteli
1924 &amp; 1926). Thereupon, Hussey (1937, 89&ndash;94),
St&eacute;phanou (1949), Tatakis (1949, 210&ndash;215, 226&ndash;227),
and Joannou (1956b) introduced him to Western scholarship. In recent
decades, Italos has gained prominence among historians of the
Byzantine world, first and foremost because of his trial and its
assumed significance for the relationship between faith and reason in
the Greek Middle Ages. The examination of his philosophical views has
received less attention and is still in its infancy.</p>

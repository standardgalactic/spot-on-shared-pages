<h1>Ontological Arguments</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Feb 8, 1996; substantive revision Mon Jun 3, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Ontological arguments are arguments, for the conclusion that God
exists, from premises which are supposed to derive from some source
other than observation of the world&mdash;e.g., from reason alone. In
other words, ontological arguments are arguments from what are
typically alleged to be none but analytic, <em>a priori</em> and
necessary premises to the conclusion that God exists.</p>

<p>
The first, and best-known, ontological argument was proposed by Anselm
of Canterbury in the eleventh century CE. In his <em>Proslogion</em>,
Anselm claims to derive the existence of that than which no greater
can be conceived from the concept of <em>that than which no greater
can be conceived</em>. Anselm reasoned that, if such a being fails to
exist, then a greater being&mdash;namely, a <em>being than which no
greater can be conceived, and which exists</em>&mdash;can be
conceived. But this would be absurd: nothing can be greater than a
being than which no greater can be conceived. So a being than which no
greater can be conceived exists. And, very plausibly, if that than
which no greater can be conceived exists, then it is God and so God
exists.</p>

<p>
In the seventeenth century, Ren&eacute; Descartes defended a family of
similar arguments. For instance, in the <em>Fifth Meditation</em>,
Descartes claims to provide a proof demonstrating the existence of a
supremely perfect being from the idea of a supremely perfect being.
Descartes argues that there is no less contradiction in conceiving a
supremely perfect being who lacks existence than there is in
conceiving a triangle whose interior angles do not sum to 180 degrees.
Hence, he supposes, since we do conceive a supremely perfect
being&mdash;we do have the idea of a supremely perfect being&mdash;we
must conclude that a supremely perfect being exists. And, very
plausibly, if a supremely perfect being exists, then God exists.</p>

<p>
In the early eighteenth century, Gottfried Leibniz attempted to fill
what he took to be a shortcoming in Descartes&rsquo; view. According
to Leibniz, Descartes&rsquo; arguments fail unless one first shows
that the idea of a supremely perfect being is coherent, or that it is
possible for there to be a supremely perfect being. Leibniz argued
that, since perfections are unanalyzable, it is impossible to
demonstrate that perfections are incompatible&mdash;and he concluded
from this that all perfections can co-exist together in a single
entity.</p>

<p>
In more recent times, Kurt G&ouml;del, Charles Hartshorne, Norman
Malcolm, and Alvin Plantinga have all presented much-discussed
ontological arguments which bear interesting connections to the
earlier arguments of Anselm, Descartes, and Leibniz. Of these, the
most interesting are those of G&ouml;del and Plantinga; in these
cases, however, it is unclear whether we should really say that these
authors claim that the arguments are <em>proofs</em> of the existence
of God.</p>

<p>
Critiques of ontological arguments begin with Gaunilo, a contemporary
of Anselm. Perhaps the best known criticisms of ontological arguments
are due to Immanuel Kant, in his <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>.
Most famously, Kant claims that ontological arguments are vitiated by
their reliance upon the implicit assumption that
&ldquo;existence&rdquo; is a real predicate. However, as Bertrand
Russell (1946: 568) observed, it is much easier to be persuaded that
ontological arguments are no good than it is to say exactly what is
wrong with them. This helps to explain why ontological arguments have
fascinated philosophers for almost a thousand years.</p>

<h2 id="Taxo">2. Taxonomy</h2>

<p>
According to a modification of the taxonomy of Oppy 1995, there are
six <em>major</em> kinds of ontological arguments, viz:</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>Definitional ontological arguments;</li>

<li>Conceptual (or hyperintensional) ontological arguments;</li>

<li>Modal ontological arguments;</li>

<li>Meinongian ontological arguments;</li>

<li>Higher-order ontological arguments; and</li>

<li>&lsquo;Hegelian&rsquo; ontological arguments.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Examples of all but the last follow. These are mostly toy examples,
but they serve to highlight features of more complex ontological
arguments.</p>

<p>
First, a (toy) definitional ontological argument:</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li id="def1">God is a being which has every perfection. (Premise,
true by definition.)</li>

<li id="def2">Existence is a perfection. (Premise)</li>

<li id="def3">Hence God exists. (From
 <a href="#def1">i</a>,
 <a href="#def2">ii</a>)</li>
</ol>

<p>
Second, a (toy) conceptual ontological argument:</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li id="conc1">I conceive of a being than which no greater can be
conceived. (Premise)</li>

<li id="conc2">If a being than which no greater can be conceived does
not exist, then I can conceive of a being greater than a being than
which no greater can be conceived&mdash;namely, a being than which no
greater can be conceived that exists. (Premise)</li>

<li id="conc3">I cannot conceive of a being greater than a being than
which no greater can be conceived. (Premise)</li>

<li id="conc4">Hence, a being than which no greater can be conceived
exists. (From
 <a href="#conc1">i</a>,
 <a href="#conc2">ii</a>, and
 <a href="#conc3">iii</a>)</li>
 </ol>

<p>
Third, a (toy) modal ontological argument:</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li id="m1">It is possible that God exists. (Premise)</li>

<li id="m2">God is not a contingent being, i.e., either it is not
possible that God exists, or it is necessary that God exists.
(Premise)</li>

<li id="m3">Hence, it is necessary that God exists. (From
 <a href="#m1">i</a>
 and
 <a href="#m2">ii</a>)</li>
 
<li id="m4">Hence, God exists. (From
 <a href="#m3">iii</a>.
 See Malcolm 1960, Hartshorne 1965, and Plantinga 1974 for closely
related arguments.)</li>
</ol>

<p>
Fourth, a (toy) Meinongian ontological argument:</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li id="Me1">[It is analytic, necessary and <em>a priori</em> that]
Each instance of the schema &ldquo;The <em>F G</em> is
<em>F</em>&rdquo; expresses a truth. (Premise)</li>

<li id="Me2">Hence the sentence &ldquo;The existent perfect being is
existent&rdquo; expresses a truth. (From
 <a href="#Me1">i</a>)</li>
 
<li id="Me3">Hence, the existent perfect being is existent. (From
 <a href="#Me2">ii</a>)</li>
 
<li id="Me4">Hence, God is existent, i.e., God exists. (From
 <a href="#Me3">iii</a>.
 The last step is justified by the observation that, as a matter of
definition, if there is exactly one existent perfect being, then that
being is God.)</li>
</ol>

<p>
Fifth, a (toy) higher-order ontological argument:</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li id="h1">A God-property is a property that is possessed by God in
all and only those worlds in which God exists. (Definition)</li>

<li id="h2">Not all properties are God properties. (Premise)</li>

<li id="h3">Any property entailed by a collection of God-properties is
itself a God-property. (Premise)</li>

<li id="h4">The God-properties include necessary existence, necessary
omnipotence, necessary omniscience, and necessary perfect goodness.
(Premise)</li>

<li id="h5">Hence, there is a necessarily existent, necessarily
omnipotent, necessarily omniscient, and necessarily perfectly good
being (namely, God). (From
 <a href="#h1">i&ndash;iv</a>.)</li>
 </ol>

<p>
Of course, this taxonomy is not exclusive: an argument can belong to
several categories at once. Moreover, an argument can be ambiguous
between a range of readings, each of which belongs to different
categories. This latter fact may help to explain part of the curious
fascination of ontological arguments. Finally, the taxonomy can be
further specialised: there are, for example, at least four importantly
different kinds of modal ontological arguments which should be
distinguished. (See, e.g., Ross 1969 for a rather different kind of
modal ontological argument.)</p>

<p>
Other (in our view <em>minor</em>) categories of ontological arguments
that might be added to this taxonomy include:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal">

<li>mereological (or Spinozistic) ontological arguments and</li>

<li>experiential ontological arguments.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The former category might be exemplified in something like the
following (toy) argument:</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>I exist.</li>

<li>Therefore something exists.</li>

<li>Whenever a bunch of things exist, their mereological sum also
exists.</li>

<li>Therefore the sum of all things exists.</li>

<li>Therefore God&mdash;the sum of all things&mdash;exists.</li>
</ol>

<p>
And the latter might be exemplified in the following (toy) argument
(and see Rescher 1959):</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>The word &lsquo;God&rsquo; has a meaning that is revealed in
religious experience. (Premise)</li>

<li>The word &lsquo;God&rsquo; has a meaning only if God exists.
(Premise)</li>

<li>Hence, God exists.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Char">3. Characterisation</h2>

<p>
It is not easy to give a good characterisation of ontological
arguments. The traditional characterisation involves the use of
controversial notions&mdash;analyticity, necessity, and <em>a
priority</em>&mdash;and also fails to apply to many arguments to which
defenders have affixed the label &ldquo;ontological&rdquo;. (Consider,
for example, the claim that I conceive of a being than which no
greater can be conceived. This claim is clearly not analytic (its
truth doesn&rsquo;t follow immediately from the meanings of the words
used to express it), nor necessary (I might never have entertained the
concept), nor <em>a priori</em> (except perhaps in my own case, though
even this is unclear&mdash;perhaps even I don&rsquo;t know
independently of experience that I have this concept.)) However, it is
unclear how that traditional characterisation should be improved
upon.</p>

<p>
Perhaps one might resolve to use the label &ldquo;ontological
argument&rdquo; for any argument which gets classified as &ldquo;an
ontological argument&rdquo; by its proponent(s). This procedure would
make good sense if one thought that there is a natural
kind&mdash;ontological arguments&mdash;which our practice carves out,
but for which it is hard to specify defining conditions. Moreover,
this procedure can be adapted as a <em>pro tem</em> stop gap: when
there is a better definition to hand, that definition will be adopted
instead. On the other hand, it seems worthwhile to attempt a more
informative definition.</p>

<p>
Focus on the case of ontological arguments for the conclusion that God
exists. One characteristic feature of these arguments is the use which
they make of &ldquo;referential vocabulary&rdquo;&mdash;names,
definite descriptions, indefinite descriptions, quantified noun
phrases, etc.&mdash;whose ontological commitments&mdash;for
occurrences of this vocabulary in &ldquo;referential
position&rdquo;&mdash;non-theists do not accept.</p>

<p>
Theists and non-theists alike (can) agree that there is
spatio-temporal, or causal, or nomic, or modal structure to the world
(the basis for cosmological arguments); and that there are certain
kinds of complexity of organisation, structure and function in the
world (the basis for teleological arguments); and so on. But theists
and non-theists are in dispute about whether there are perfect beings,
or beings than which no greater can be conceived, or &hellip;; thus,
theists and non-theists are in dispute about the <em>indirect</em>
subject matter of the premises of ontological arguments.</p>

<p>
Of course, the premises of ontological arguments often do not deal
directly with perfect beings, beings than which no greater can be
conceived, etc.; rather, they deal with descriptions of, or ideas of,
or concepts of, or the possibility of the existence of, these things.
However, the basic point remains: ontological arguments require the
use of vocabulary which non-theists should certainly find problematic
when it is used in ontologically committing contexts.</p>

<p>
Note that this characterisation does not beg the question against the
possibility of the construction of a successful ontological
argument&mdash;i.e., it does not lead immediately to the conclusion
that all ontological arguments are question-begging (in virtue of the
ontologically committing vocabulary which they employ). For it may be
that the vocabulary in question only gets used in premises in ways
that carry no ontological commitment. Of course, there will then be
questions about whether the resulting arguments can possibly be
valid&mdash;how could the commitments turn up in the conclusion if
they are not there in the premises?&mdash;but those are further
questions, which would remain to be addressed.</p>

<h2 id="UsesGoal">4. Uses and Goals</h2>

<p>
Before we turn to assessment of ontological arguments, we need to get
clear about what the proper intended goals of ontological arguments
can be. Suppose we think of arguments as having advocates and targets:
when an advocate presents an argument to a target, the goal of the
advocate is to bring about some change in the target. What might be
the targets of ontological arguments, and what might be the changes
that advocates of these arguments aim to bring about in those
targets?</p>

<p>
Here are some proposals; no doubt the reader can think of others:</p>

<ul>

<li>The targets might be atheists, and the goal might be to turn them
into theists.</li>

<li>The targets might be agnostics, and the goal might be to turn them
into theists.</li>

<li>The targets might be theists, and the goal might be to improve the
doxastic position of theists.</li>

<li>The targets might be professional philosophers, and the goal might
be to advance understanding of the consequences of adopting particular
logical rules, or treating existence as a real predicate, or allowing
definitions to have existential import, or the like.</li>

<li>The targets might be undergraduate philosophy students, and the
goal might be to give them some sufficiently frustrating examples on
which to cut their critical teeth.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In the coming discussion, it will be supposed that the targets are
atheists and agnostics, and that the goal is to turn them into
theists. Suppose that an advocate presents an ontological argument to
a target. What conditions must that argument satisfy if it is fit for
its intended purpose? A plausible suggestion is that, minimally, it
should make the targets recognise that they have good reason to accept
the conclusion of the argument that they did not recognise that they
have prior to the presentation of the argument. Adopting this
plausible suggestion provides the following criterion: a successful
ontological argument is one that should make atheists and agnostics
recognise that they have good reason to believe that God exists that
they did not recognise that they have prior to the presentation of the
argument. Note that this criterion has a normative dimension: it
adverts to what atheists and agnostics <em>should</em> do when
presented with the argument.</p>

<p>
There is an important discussion to be had about whether we should
suppose that the targets of ontological arguments are atheists and
agnostics and that the goal is to turn them into theists. It is simply
beyond the scope of this entry to fully pursue that discussion here.
We conclude this section by mentioning just one straw in the wind.</p>

<p>
Towards the end of his presentation of his modal ontological argument,
Plantinga writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Our verdict on these reformulated versions of St. Anselm&rsquo;s
argument must be as follows. They cannot, perhaps, be said to
<em>prove</em> or <em>establish</em> their conclusion. But since it is
rational to accept their central premise, they do show that it is
rational to accept that conclusion. (1974: 221)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, it seems, Plantinga is supposing that the targets of ontological
arguments are those who think that it is not rationally permissible to
believe in God. Moreover, it seems reasonable to think that his
ambition is to bring them to think that it is rationally permissible
to believe in God. But the difficulty here is that the reasons that we
have for supposing that his arguments are insufficient to bring
atheist and agnostics to belief in God carry over quite
straightforwardly to reasons for supposing that his arguments are
insufficient to bring those who think that it is not rationally
permissible to believe in God to belief that it is rationally
permissible to believe in God. Atheists think that at least one
premise in his argument is false. Agnostics are undecided about at
least one premise in his argument. And those who think that it is not
rationally permissible to believe in God think that there is at least
one premise in his argument in which it is not rationally permissible
to believe.</p>

<p>
Perhaps it might be objected that Plantinga supposes, instead, that
the targets of ontological arguments are theists.
However&mdash;setting aside the point that it is not at all clear what
such arguments could do for theists&mdash;it is unclear why Plantinga
supposes that the status of the claim that it is rationally
permissible to believe that God exists is importantly different from
the status of the claim that God exists <em>for</em> theists. After
all, theists for whom Plantinga thinks that the argument might do some
useful work believe all of the premises <em>and</em> believe that all
of the premises are such that it is rationally permissible to believe
them. What could be the source of the asymmetry which brings it about
that, while the argument fails to show to these theists that God
exists, it succeeds in showing to these theists that it is rationally
permissible to believe in God?</p>

<p>

 <a href="#Moda">Section 8</a>
 below.</p>

<h2 id="Desc">5. Descartes</h2>

<p>
Descartes presents what have come to be called &lsquo;Cartesian
ontological arguments&rsquo; in various places: <em>Meditation V</em>,
many of the <em>Replies</em> (including the <em>First</em> (Caterus),
the <em>Second</em> (mostly Mersenne), and the <em>Fifth</em>
(Gassendi)), <em>Discourse IV</em>, and <em>Principles XIV</em>.
Although there is little that is uncontroversial in the discussion of
Cartesian ontological arguments, even the most casual reading of the
texts reveals that the following argument has some relevance:</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>God has every perfection.</li>

<li>Independent existence is a perfection.</li>

<li>(So) God exists.</li>
</ol>

<p>
While it is now quite common to claim that Descartes was not advancing
any argument in favour of the existence of God in the texts in
question&mdash;see, for example, the entry on
 <a href="../descartes-ontological/">Descartes&rsquo; ontological argument</a>&mdash;it
 is clear that, insofar as there is a valid argument for the existence
of God that is properly associated with the Cartesian texts, it is
something like the argument just given.</p>

<p>
A natural objection to this argument is that the conclusion follows
trivially from the first premise alone. While the argument is
valid&mdash;albeit possessed of a redundant premise&mdash;it is
obvious that it can play no role in persuading informed atheists and
agnostics to change their views. After all, informed atheists deny
that God has every perfection on the ground that God does not exist,
i.e., on the ground that there is no God that has so much as one
perfection, let alone all of them. Equally, informed agnostics do not
accept that God has every perfection by dint of not accepting that God
exists, i.e., by dint of not accepting that there is a God that has so
much as one perfection, let alone all of them.</p>

<p>
One response to this objection is to reject the claim that it follows
from the non-existence of God that there are no true sentences of the
form &lsquo;God has [such and such perfection]&rsquo;. To go this way
is to suppose that there are non-existent beings that nonetheless can
be truly claimed to have properties. That is the way of Meinong. We
shall return to consider it below.</p>

<p>
Another response to this objection is to claim that the first premise
really doesn&rsquo;t do justice to the argument that is properly
associated with the Cartesian texts. On this kind of view, the
argument is better represented like this:</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>By definition, God has every perfection</li>

<li>Independent existence is a perfection.</li>

<li>(So) God exists.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This won&rsquo;t do. The argument is now clearly invalid. The most
that we can conclude, from the premise set is: (By definition) God has
independent existence. And it simply does not follow from this that
God exists. No informed agnostic or atheist, when presented with an
argument that begins with the claim that, by definition, God is the
being that has every perfection, will reach any conclusion other than
that there is no being that has every perfection (on the grounds that
there is no God).</p>

<p>
There are other fixes to which one might turn. Perhaps we might follow
recent discussion which claims that all that Descartes wants to commit
himself to, initially, is that it is obvious to intuition that God has
every perfection.</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>Intuitively, God has every perfection.</li>

<li>Independent existence is a perfection.</li>

<li>(So) God exists.</li>
</ol>

<p>
On the most natural reading of this argument, it suffers from the same
liability as the very first argument that we associated with the
Cartesian text: given that we accept that <em>p</em> follows from
intuitively <em>p</em>, it is clear that informed agnostics and
atheists reject that claim that intuitively, God has every perfection.
And, on what seems a less natural reading of the argument, which takes
it to be saying something like the following:</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>It seems intuitive to me (Descartes) that God has every
perfection.</li>

<li>Independent existence is a perfection.</li>

<li>(So) God exists.</li>
</ol>

<p>
the argument is obviously invalid. Why should informed agnostics or
atheists be in the least bit impressed by what seems intuitive to
<em>Descartes</em> on the question whether God has every
perfection?</p>

<p>
There is a general lesson that we can extract at this point. If we
represent our Cartesian argument in the following way:</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>[Operator] God has every perfection.</li>

<li>Independent existence is a perfection.</li>

<li>(So) God exists.</li>
</ol>

<p>
then we can raise the following question: what could possibly go in
for <em>[Operator]</em> that would both (a) yield a claim that is
acceptable to informed agnostics and atheists, and (b) deliver a valid
argument? It is tempting to suggest that, at least setting Meinongian
considerations to one side, it is obvious that there isn&rsquo;t
anything that can fit this bill.</p>

<p>
There is a very large and complicated literature on Cartesian
ontological arguments. Apart from the discussion in the SEP entry on
 <a href="../descartes-ontological/">Descartes&rsquo; ontological argument</a>,
 readers might like to consider: Nolan (2018).</p>

<h2 id="ProsII">6. <em>Proslogion II</em></h2>

<p>
There is an enormous literature on the material in <em>Proslogion
II&ndash;IV</em>. Some commentators deny that Anselm tried to put
forward any proofs of the existence of God. Even among commentators
who agree that Anselm intended to prove the existence of God, there is
disagreement about where the proof is located. Some commentators claim
that the main proof is in <em>Proslogion II</em>, and that the rest of
the work draws out corollaries of that proof (see, e.g., Charlesworth
1965). Other commentators claim that the main proof is in
<em>Proslogion III</em>, and that the proof in <em>Proslogion II</em>
is merely an inferior first attempt (see, e.g., Malcolm 1960). Yet
other commentators claim that there is a single proof which spans at
least <em>Proslogion II&ndash;III</em> (see, e.g., Campbell 1976 and
Tapp &amp; Siegwart 2022) and, perhaps, the entire work (see, e.g., La
Croix 1972). In what follows, we ignore this aspect of the controversy
about the <em>Proslogion</em>. Instead, we focus just on the question
of the analysis of the material in <em>Proslogion II</em> on the
assumption that there is an independent argument, for the existence
(in reality) of that than which no greater can be conceived, that is
given therein.</p>

<p>
Here is one translation of the crucial part of <em>Proslogion II</em>
(due to William Mann [1972: 260&ndash;1]; alternative translations can
be found in Barnes 1972, Campbell 1976, Charlesworth 1965, and
elsewhere):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Thus even the fool is convinced that something than which nothing
greater can be conceived is in the understanding, since when he hears
this, he understands it; and whatever is understood is in the
understanding. And certainly that than which a greater cannot be
conceived cannot be in the understanding alone. For if it is even in
the understanding alone, it can be conceived to exist in reality also,
which is greater. Thus if that than which a greater cannot be
conceived is in the understanding alone, then that than which a
greater cannot be conceived is itself that than which a greater can be
conceived. But surely this cannot be. Thus without doubt something
than which a greater cannot be conceived exists, both in the
understanding and in reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There have been many ingenious attempts to find an argument which can
be expressed in modern logical formalism, which is logically valid,
and which might plausibly be claimed to be <em>the</em> argument which
is expressed in this passage. As a first effort, we might suppose that
the argument might be represented as follows:</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li id="pro1">When the fool hears the words &lsquo;that than which no
greater can be conceived&rsquo; he understands those words.
(Premise)</li>

<li id="pro2">Whatever is understood exists in the understanding.
(Premise)</li>

<li id="pro3">(So) That than which no greater can be conceived exists
in the understanding. (From
 <a href="#pro1">i</a>,
 <a href="#pro2">ii</a>)</li>

<li id="pro4">If that than which no greater can be conceived exists in
the understanding, it can be conceived to exist in reality.
(Premise)</li>

<li id="pro5">That than which no greater can be conceived is greater
if it exists in reality than if it exists only in the understanding.
(Premise)</li>

<li id="pro6">It is impossible to conceive of something greater than
that than which no greater can be conceived. (Premise)</li>

<li id="pro7">(So) That than which no greater can be conceived exists
in reality. (From
 <a href="#pro3">iii</a>,
 <a href="#pro4">iv</a>,
 <a href="#pro5">v</a>,
 and
 <a href="#pro6">vi</a>.)</li>
 </ol>

<p>
The obvious difficulty with this representation is that it is not
exactly clear how we are meant to get to
 <a href="#pro7">(vii)</a>
 from
 <a href="#pro3">(iii)</a>,
 <a href="#pro4">(iv)</a>,
 <a href="#pro5">(v)</a>,
 and
 <a href="#pro6">(vi)</a>.
 We might hope to confront this difficulty by
&lsquo;translating&rsquo; Anselm&rsquo;s argument into a different
idiom. However, attempts to recast Anselm&rsquo;s argument in modal
terms or Meinongian terms seem not to do justice both to
Anselm&rsquo;s argumentative ambitions and to other sections of the
<em>Proslogion</em>.</p>

<p>
If we stick with a formulation that stays close to the original text,
then there are many other questions of interpretation that remain to
be addressed. In particular, the key vocabulary that is used in
framing this argument raises many issues. What is it for one thing to
be &lsquo;greater&rsquo; than another? What is required for it to be
true that something &lsquo;can be conceived&rsquo;? What is meant by
&lsquo;the understanding&rsquo;? What is it for something to
&lsquo;exist in the understanding&rsquo;? How is &lsquo;existence in
the understanding&rsquo; related to being something that &lsquo;can be
conceived&rsquo;? Can the very same thing &lsquo;exist in the
understanding&rsquo; and &lsquo;exist in reality&rsquo;? If so, does
it have the very same properties &lsquo;in the understanding&rsquo;
and &lsquo;in reality&rsquo;? Since we certainly appear to understand
the expression &lsquo;the really existent tallest inhabitant of the
planet Mars&rsquo;, does Anselm think that the really existent tallest
inhabitant of the planet Mars exists in the understanding? If so, does
he think that, in the understanding, the really existent tallest
inhabitant of the planet Mars has the property of really existing? If
so, does he think that it follows that the really existent tallest
inhabitant of the planet Mars has the property of really existing?
Would Anselm be uncomfortable with <em>a priori</em> commitment to the
<em>real</em> existence of Martians? Would he deny that we understand
the expression &lsquo;the really existent tallest inhabitant of the
planet Mars&rsquo;? Would he say that, even though, in the
understanding, the really existent tallest inhabitant of the planet
Mars has the property of really existing, nonetheless it does not
follow that that the really existent tallest inhabitant of the planet
Mars has the property of really existing? And so on.</p>

<p>
The important point here is that, until we are given answers to the
questions raised in the previous paragraph, we have no way of
determining whether anyone can safely accept Anselm&rsquo;s
theoretical framework. It is not true that the only important question
is whether Anselm&rsquo;s conclusion follows from his premises.
Another equally important question is what else follows from the
(perhaps tacit) theory that informs Anselm&rsquo;s construction of the
argument. If that theory has absurd consequences, then the validity of
the argument is inconsequential.</p>

<p>
The literature on <em>Proslogion II&ndash;IV</em> is so vast that it
could easily have an entry devoted solely to it. Important recent
contributions to the literature include: Campbell (2018); Holopainen
(2020); Leftow (2022); Speaks (2018); and Tapp &amp; Siegwart (2022).
Finally, see Smith (2014) for an Anselmian causal-cum-ontological
argument.</p>

<h2 id="Mein">7. Meinong</h2>

<p>
It is very natural to affirm both of the following things:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="affirm1">(1)</dt>
<dd>Santa Claus has a white beard.</dd>
<dt id="affirm2">(2)</dt>
<dd>Santa Claus does not exist.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
However, if we affirm both
 <a href="#affirm1">(1)</a>
 and
 <a href="#affirm2">(2)</a>,
 then it seems that we are committed to the claim that there are
non-existent beings. What makes (1) true is that there is a being,
Santa Claus, that has a white beard. What makes (2) true is that that
being is non-existent.</p>

<p>
As Russell noted, naive theories about non-existent beings are apt to
end in contradiction. Perhaps we can happily accept that the tall
Martian is tall (for a Martian) while also accepting that the tall
Martian is non-existent. But we contradict ourselves if we say that
the existent Martian is existent while also maintaining that the
existent Martian is non-existent.</p>

<p>
The general point here is that, when we think about which assignments
of properties to beings could receive our <em>a priori</em>
endorsement, we have to put limitations on the class of properties
that figure in those assignments. While we might be happy with the
idea that we know <em>a priori</em> that the tall Martian is tall (for
a Martian), we know that we cannot be happy with the idea that we know
<em>a priori</em> that the existent Martian is existent. Of course, it
should not be thought that existence is the only problematic property:
we can no more give <em>a priori</em> endorsement to any of the
following:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="affirm3">(3)</dt>
<dd>The possible round square is possible.</dd>
<dt id="affirm4">(4)</dt>
<dd>The necessary round square is necessary.</dd>
<dt id="affirm5">(5)</dt>
<dd>The actual round square is actual.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The upshot for ontological arguments is clear. If your theory commits
you to a distinction between being and existence, then, while that
theory alone may give you that it is true that Santa Claus has a white
beard, that theory alone does not give you that God is a perfect being
(if, for example, perfection requires existence, or necessary
existence, or the like). A proponent of the simple Cartesian argument
that we considered earlier cannot properly claim that the truth of the
first premise&mdash;&lsquo;God has every
perfection&rsquo;&mdash;simply falls out of the general (Meinongian)
theory of being and existence while also insisting that the second
premise is true.</p>

<p>
Moreover, it should be noted that we cannot avoid this conclusion by
preferring a theoretical framework in which, because essence is prior
to existence, claims like &lsquo;Santa Claus has a white beard&rsquo;
are made true by essences. While it might be true that it falls out of
this kind of theory that &lsquo;The tallest Martian is tall (for a
Martian)&rsquo; is made true by the essence of the tallest Martian, it
cannot be true that &lsquo;The necessary tallest Martian is
necessary&rsquo; is made true by the essence of the necessary tallest
Martian. Of course, it is open to theists to claim, <em>on other
grounds</em>, that there is a divine essence; but while that can
entitle them to suppose that our Cartesian ontological argument is
sound, it is plainly insufficient to entitle them to suppose that our
Cartesian ontological argument is such as ought to persuade agnostics
and atheists to accept its conclusion.</p>

<p>
The point that we have just made extends to other ontological
arguments. In particular, it extends to Meinongian interpretations of
Anselm&rsquo;s argument. While, as we noted above, it is not entirely
clear how to understand talk about &lsquo;the understanding&rsquo;,
etc., it is tempting to interpret it in a Meinongian light. However,
if we do that, then the formulation of the argument requires
assumptions&mdash;rejected by atheists and agnostics&mdash;that do not
simply fall out of the general Meinongian theoretical framework.</p>

<p>
For further discussion of Meinongian ontological arguments, see, for
example: Dummett (1983 [1993]); Oppenheimer &amp; Zalta (1991); Oppy
(1996); Priest (2018); and Salmon (1987). And, for Meinongianism
itself, see the entry on
 <a href="../nonexistent-objects/">non-existent objects</a>
 and the literature cited therein.</p>

<h2 id="Moda">8. Modal</h2>

<p>
The modal ontological argument (MOA) proceeds from God&rsquo;s
<em>possible</em> existence to God&rsquo;s <em>actual</em> existence.
While different variations of the argument exist (e.g., Malcolm 1960,
Hartshorne 1965, Plantinga 1974), they typically share four parts:</p>

<ul class="jfy">

<li>The first part is a <em>characterisation</em> of the being to be
argued for. Some MOAs focus on a <em>maximally great being</em>, where
a being is maximally great if and only if it exists necessarily and is
essentially omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect (Plantinga
1974). Other MOAs focus on a <em>perfect being</em>, where a being is
perfect if and only if it essentially possesses every perfection and
essentially lacks every imperfection (Bernstein 2014). Still other
MOAs focus simply on <em>God</em> (McIntosh 2021). The precise
characterisation at play will influence the justification of the
second and third parts.</li>

<li>The second part is the <em>possibility premise</em>, which asserts
that the characterised being is metaphysically possible.
(<em>Metaphysical possibility</em> is here understood minimally as the
broadest kind of objective, non-epistemic possibility.)</li>

<li>The third part is the <em>necessity premise</em>, which asserts
that the characterised being would be a <em>metaphysically necessary
being</em>&mdash;in any possible world in which the being exists, it
is necessary that said being exists.</li>

<li>The fourth part is a modal logic that (a) accurately captures
metaphysical modality and (b) is strong enough to validate an
inference from the <em>possible</em> necessary existence of \(x\) to
the <em>necessary</em> existence of \(x\) (or, minimally, to the
<em>existence</em> of \(x\)). Typically used is S5, whose
characteristic axiom is \(\Diamond p \rightarrow \Box\Diamond p\),
which in turn entails \(\Diamond\Box p \rightarrow \Box p\) (Rasmussen
2018: 180). But a weaker system like B validates \(\Diamond\Box p
\rightarrow p\) and could therefore be used instead (Leftow
2005).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Thus, with God as our characterised being and S5 as our modal logic, a
standard formulation of the MOA runs:</p>

<dl class="sentag indent">
<dt id="S5-1">i.</dt>
<dd>Possibly, God exists. (Possibility premise)</dd>
<dt id="S5-2">ii.</dt>
<dd>Necessarily, if God exists, then it is necessary that God exists.
(Necessity premise)</dd>
<dt id="S5-3">iii.</dt>
<dd>(Hence) It is necessary that God exists. (From
 <a href="#S5-1">i</a>,
 <a href="#S5-2">ii</a>)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
According to
 <a href="#S5-2">(ii)</a>,
 it&rsquo;s true in any possible world in which God exists that it is
necessary that God exists. According to
 <a href="#S5-1">(i)</a>,
 there&rsquo;s some possible world in which God exists. From
 <a href="#S5-1">(i)</a>
 and
 <a href="#S5-2">(ii)</a>
 it follows that there&rsquo;s some possible world in which it is
necessary that God exists&mdash;i.e., it&rsquo;s possibly necessary
that God exists. By S5, \(\Diamond\Box p \rightarrow \Box p\). Hence,
it&rsquo;s necessary that God exists. By axiom M (\(\Box p \rightarrow
p\)), it follows that God exists.</p>

<p>
Naturally, there are three ways to challenge the MOA so construed,
each corresponding to the final three parts articulated earlier.
First, one can challenge the inference from
 <a href="#S5-1">(i)</a>
 and
 <a href="#S5-2">(ii)</a>
 to
 <a href="#S5-3">(iii)</a>
 by challenging whether the modal logic underlying the argument
accurately captures metaphysical modality. (For some such challenges,
see Chandler 1976 and Salmon 1989. For defences of S5&rsquo;s
metaphysical adequacy, see Pruss &amp; Rasmussen 2018: 14&ndash;29,
Williamson 2016, Hale 2013, and Leftow 1991: 6&ndash;14). Second, one
can challenge the necessity premise. While some characterisations
(e.g., <em>maximally great being</em> as defined above) render the
premise definitionally true, others require substantive argumentation.
For example, if the characterisation at play is <em>perfect
being</em>, then the MOA proponent must argue that <em>necessary
existence</em> is a perfection. Similarly, if the characterisation at
play is <em>God</em>, then the MOA proponent must justify the claim
that God would be a necessary being. (Against this claim, see
Swinburne 2012. Against Swinburne and for God&rsquo;s necessity, see
Rasmussen 2016.) Third, one can challenge the possibility premise by
arguing either that the characterised being is metaphysically
impossible or that its metaphysical possibility hasn&rsquo;t been
adequately justified. Falling into this third category is perhaps the
most important objection to the MOA: the symmetry problem.</p>

<p>
To draw out this problem, consider the following <em>Reverse MOA</em>
(<em>RMOA</em>):</p>

<dl class="sentag indent">
<dt id="RS5-1">i*.</dt>
<dd>Possibly, God doesn&rsquo;t exist.</dd>
<dt id="RS5-2">ii.</dt>
<dd>Necessarily, if God exists, then it is necessary that God
exists.</dd>
<dt id="RS5-3">iii*.</dt>
<dd>(Hence) It is necessary that God doesn&rsquo;t exist.
 (<a href="#RS5-1">i*</a>,
 <a href="#RS5-2">ii</a>)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Like the MOA, the RMOA is valid in S5. To see this, notice that
 <a href="#RS5-1">(i*)</a>
 is the negation of
 <a href="#S5-3">(iii)</a>
 and that
 <a href="#S5-3">(iii)</a>
 follows from
 <a href="#S5-1">(i)</a>
 and
 <a href="#S5-2">(ii)</a>
 in S5. Hence,
 <a href="#RS5-1">(i*)</a>
 and
 <a href="#RS5-2">(ii)</a>
 together entail the negation of
 <a href="#S5-1">(i)</a>&mdash;i.e.,
 they entail that it is <em>impossible</em> that God exists. This
impossibility, in turn, is logically equivalent to
 <a href="#RS5-3">(iii*)</a>.</p>
 
<p>
But
 <a href="#RS5-3">(iii*)</a>
 is incompatible with
 <a href="#S5-3">(iii)</a>,
 and
 <a href="#S5-2">(ii)</a>
 is the same in both arguments. Thus, assuming
 <a href="#S5-2">(ii)</a>
 and S5,
 <a href="#S5-1">(i)</a>
 and
 <a href="#RS5-1">(i*)</a>
 are incompatible. And yet
 <a href="#S5-1">(i)</a>
 and
 <a href="#RS5-1">(i*)</a>
 seem epistemically on par&mdash;it seems intolerably arbitrary to
privilege one over the other absent further considerations.
What&rsquo;s needed is some principled reason favouring one over the
other, i.e., a consideration that <em>breaks symmetry</em> between
them. <em>Absent</em> such a symmetry breaker, however, the MOA is
dialectically toothless&mdash;quite clearly, if you don&rsquo;t
already accept the claim that God exists, you won&rsquo;t agree that
 <a href="#S5-1">(i)</a>
 is more acceptable than
 <a href="#RS5-1">(i*)</a>
 absent some symmetry breaker. Thus, without a symmetry breaker, the
MOA makes no headway in the dispute between theists and
non-theists.</p>

<p>
The natural solution to the symmetry problem, of course, is to offer a
symmetry breaker favouring
 <a href="#S5-1">(i)</a>
 over
 <a href="#RS5-1">(i*)</a>.
 Categorisation problems loom on the horizon here&mdash;for example,
many such symmetry breakers appeal to premises that aren&rsquo;t <em>a
priori</em>, and so they threaten MOA&rsquo;s status as a properly
<em>ontological</em> argument. Furthermore, even if they only appeal
to <em>a priori</em> premises, symmetry breakers may represent
distinct ontological arguments <em>in their own
right</em>&mdash;distinct, that is, from the MOA. Notwithstanding
these concerns, the MOA debate has centred around symmetry breaking,
and hence symmetry breakers merit consideration here.</p>

<p>
For further discussion of the most influential
MOA&mdash;Plantinga&rsquo;s MOA&mdash;see (e.g.) Adams (1988),
Chandler (1993), Oppy (1995: 70&ndash;78, 248&ndash;259), Tooley
(1981), van Inwagen (1977), and Rasmussen (2018). For a recent
re-casting of the modal ontological argument using only a standard
extension of system K, see Hausmann (2022).</p>

<h2 id="Gdel">9. G&ouml;del</h2>

<p>
We begin with a representative G&ouml;delian ontological argument.
This argument&mdash;like all G&ouml;delian ontological
arguments&mdash;is couched in terms of the notion of a positive
property. The conclusion of the argument is that there is a being
whose essential properties are all and only the positive properties.
The argument has the following premises:</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li id="pp1">A property \(A\) is positive only if its negation \(\neg
A\) is not positive.</li>

<li id="pp2">If \(A\) is positive and \(A\) entails \(B\) then \(B\)
is positive.</li>

<li id="pp3">Having as essential properties all and only the positive
properties is positive.</li>

<li id="pp4">Necessary existence is positive.</li>
</ol>

<p>
From
 <a href="#pp1">(i)</a>
 and
 <a href="#pp2">(ii)</a>,
 we can infer that any collection of positive properties is possibly
jointly instantiated. Given
 <a href="#pp3">(iii)</a>,
 we can then infer that having as essential properties all and only
the positive properties is possibly instantiated. Given
 <a href="#pp4">(iv)</a>,
 we can then infer that having as essential properties all and only
the positive properties is possibly necessarily instantiated. And
then, assuming that the modal logic is S5, we infer that there is a
necessarily existent being that has all and only the positive
properties. (See Pruss 2018a for discussion of ways in which this
representative argument can be improved. These improvements have no
bearing on the subsequent discussion in this section.)</p>

<p>
Perhaps the most important point to note, for discussion of this
argument, is the following: no property that is necessarily
uninstantiated is positive. Suppose that \(A\) is necessarily
uninstantiated but positive. Since \(A\) is necessarily
uninstantiated, for any \(B\), \(A\) entails \(B\) and \(A\) entails
\(\neg B\). But by
 <a href="#pp2">2</a>&mdash;since
 any property entailed by a positive property is itself
positive&mdash;\(B\) is positive and \(\neg B\) is positive. But, by
 <a href="#pp1">1</a>,
 if \(B\) is positive, then \(\neg B\) is not positive. Contradiction.
Hence, if \(A\) is necessarily uninstantiated, then \(A\) is not
positive.</p>

<p>
In the context of necessary being theism, it is controversial between
theists and atheists which properties are necessarily uninstantiated.
Atheists who suppose&mdash;as many do&mdash;that omnipotence,
omniscience, perfect goodness, and so forth, are necessarily
uninstantiated <em>deny</em> that omnipotence, omniscience, perfect
goodness, and so forth, are positive (on the assumption that positive
properties obey both 1 and 2). Moreover, some&mdash;though not
all&mdash;atheists deny that necessary existence is positive (on the
assumption that positive properties obey both
 <a href="#pp1">1</a>
 and
 <a href="#pp1">2</a>).
 Unless we have an independent, non-question-begging way to discern
which properties are positive, this looks like game over for
G&ouml;delian ontological arguments.</p>

<p>
A significant part of the recent literature has tried to motivate
particular ways of understanding the notion of a positive property. We
might take the relevant axioms to provide a partial definition of
positivity; but those axioms provide no guidance when it comes to
substantive content. Pruss (2018a) discusses five candidate
substantive proposals:</p>

<ul class="hanging">

<li><em>Comparison</em>. A property \(A\) is positive iff for any
\(x\), it is better for \(x\) to have \(A\) then for \(x\) to lack
\(A\).</li>

<li><em>Excellence</em>. A property \(A\) is positive iff for any
\(x\), having \(A\) in no way detracts from the excellence of \(x\),
but having \(\neg A\) does in some way detract from the excellence of
\(x\).</li>

<li><em>Anti-Negativity</em>. A property \(A\) is positive iff \(\neg
A\) is negative.</li>

<li><em>Leibniz</em>. A property is positive iff \(A\) is entailed by
a (possibly trivial) conjunction of simple, absolute properties,</li>

<li><em>No Limitations</em>. A property \(A\) is positive iff \(A\)
does not entail being limited and \(\neg A\) does entail being
limited.</li>
</ul>

<p>
One obvious problem with all of these proposals, in the context of the
important point noted above, is that they do not give definitive
guidance when it comes to controversial cases in which some hold that
a property is necessarily uninstantiated and others do not. Consider
necessary omnipotence. If it is impossible for anything to be
necessarily omnipotent&mdash;and if we are holding onto the assumption
that positive properties are non-trivially closed under
entailment&mdash;then:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<li>it is clearly not the case that it is better to be necessarily
omnipotent than to be not necessarily omnipotent;</li>

<li>it is clearly not the case that being necessarily omnipotent does
not detract from excellence in any way;</li>

<li>it is clearly not the case that not being necessarily omnipotent
is negative;</li>

<li>it is clearly not the case that being necessarily omnipotent is
entailed by a (possibly trivial) conjunction of simple, absolute
properties; and</li>

<li>it is clearly not the case that not being necessarily omnipotent
entails being limited.</li>
</ol>

<p>
While there are other difficulties that confront all of these
proposals, there is no need to engage in exploration of those
difficulties here.</p>

<p>
Perhaps there is one final point worth making. There is nothing that
we have said here that suggests that one cannot rationally suppose
that</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">

<li>the positive properties are non-trivially closed under entailment,
and</li>

<li>necessary existence, necessary omnipotence, necessary omniscience
and necessary perfect goodness are all positive properties.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Nor does anything in what we have said suggest that one who rationally
supposes these things cannot find the various claims intuitive. What
matters here is only that, given the conditions that we have set for
determining whether or not arguments are successful, what certain
<strong>theists</strong> find intuitive has no bearing on the
<em>success</em> of G&ouml;del&rsquo;s ontological argument.</p>

<p>
The literature on G&ouml;del and G&ouml;del&rsquo;s ontological
argument is vast. Notable contributions include: Adams (1995);
Anderson (1990); Hazen (1998); Kova&#269; (2003); Pruss (2009, 2018a);
Pruss &amp; Rasmussen (2018: ch. 8); Sobel (1987, 2004); and
&#346;wi&#281;torzecka [ed.] (2015).</p>

<h2 id="Hege">10. Hegel</h2>

<p>
There is a large literature on Hegel and &lsquo;the ontological
argument&rsquo;. As noted by Redding and Bubbio (2014: 467&ndash;8),
Hegel was clearly attracted to Anselm&rsquo;s <em>Proslogion</em>
argument. However, Hegel thought that Kant had shown that
Anselm&rsquo;s <em>Proslogion</em> argument is fatally flawed. But
Hegel also thought that the fatal flaw that Kant had identified could
be overcome. Assessing this last claim of Hegel&rsquo;s is not easy.
In particular, as many people have noted, Hegel nowhere gives an
explicit formulation of the premises and conclusion of &lsquo;the
ontological argument&rsquo; that he endorses. Given the conception of
argument with which we have been working, it is not clear that there
is any such thing as &lsquo;the ontological argument&rsquo; that Hegel
endorsed.</p>

<p>
Redding and Bubbio attempt to</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
point a way towards a reconstruction of the [ontological argument]
from the framework within which Hegel makes his diagnosis [of the
incompleteness of the Proslogion argument]. (2014: 466)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
However, they do not give an explicit formulation of the premises and
conclusion of &lsquo;the ontological argument&rsquo; that Hegel is
alleged to endorse. Instead, they outline some important parts of
Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy, and claim that something that might be taken
to be the conclusion of &lsquo;the ontological argument&rsquo; fits
comfortably with that outline.</p>

<p>
The interpretation of Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy is, of course,
controversial. As noted in Redding (2020), we can distinguish between
at least:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>the traditional metaphysical view of Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy
(Taylor 1975; Rosen 1984);</li>

<li>the &lsquo;non-metaphysical&rsquo; Kantian view of Hegel&rsquo;s
philosophy (Pippin 1989; Pinkard 1994; Brandom 2002; McDowell 2006);
and</li>

<li>the revised metaphysical view of Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy (Stern
2002; Houlgate 2005; Kreines 2006; Yeomans 2012).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Moreover, the interpretation of Hegel&rsquo;s writings about religion
and God are also controversial: perhaps depending upon which of his
writings we emphasise, we may take him to be Christian, pantheist, or
atheist.</p>

<p>
According to Redding and Bubbio:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The speech of act of mutual forgiveness, says Hegel, &lsquo;is God
manifested in the midst of those who know themselves in the form of
pure knowledge&rsquo;. In the human act of forgiveness, God is
fleetingly given corporeal existence, and what looks like human acts
provide the occasion of the self-actualisation of the divine. Indeed,
Hegel seems to conceive of the apparently human act of proving the
existence of God in the same way. It is an act in which God passes
from &lsquo;mere&rsquo; concept into existing &lsquo;idea&rsquo;. And
it is fitting that this happens within the medium proper to
Hegel&rsquo;s God&mdash;thought. (2014: 482)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
What should those who identify as atheists or agnostics make of this?
They can clearly acknowledge that there are human acts of mutual
forgiveness. But, in the light of the history of religion, theology,
etc., they will likely have not the slightest temptation to invoke God
or the divine when we make this acknowledgement. Moreover, and
consequently, they will simply dismiss talk about God&rsquo;s passing
from &ldquo;&lsquo;mere&rsquo; concept to existing
&lsquo;idea&rsquo;&rdquo;: whatever content you might want to
attribute to that talk, it simply does not touch atheists and
agnostics. The notion that there is an argument here that ought to
persuade atheists and agnostics to revise their worldviews seems
utterly forlorn. This is not to deny that, from within a Hegelian
perspective, these claims might be seen to be utterly compelling. No
doubt there are people who suppose that in human acts of forgiveness,
God passes from &lsquo;mere&rsquo; concept to existing
&lsquo;idea&rsquo;. But those people have a range of controversial
theoretical commitments that are not shared by atheists and agnostics
(nor by a great many theists, we might add).</p>

<h2 id="Paro">11. Parodies</h2>

<p>
There is a large literature discussing parodies of ontological
arguments, beginning with Gaunilo&rsquo;s &lsquo;perfect island&rsquo;
objection to Anselm&rsquo;s <em>Proslogion II</em> argument. It is
important to note, at the outset, that particular parodies are tied to
particular formulations of ontological arguments, and are intended
only to raise questions about the probative value of those particular
formulations of ontological arguments.</p>

<p>
Consider our earlier formulation of Anselm&rsquo;s <em>Proslogion
II</em> argument:</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li id="A1">When the fool hears the words &lsquo;that than which no
greater can be conceived&rsquo; he understands those words.
(Premise)</li>

<li id="A2">Whatever is understood exists in the understanding.
(Premise)</li>

<li id="A3">(So) That than which no greater can be conceived exists in
the understanding. (From
 <a href="#A1">i</a>,
 <a href="#A2">ii</a>)</li>

<li id="A4">If that than which no greater can be conceived exists in
the understanding, it can be conceived to exist in reality.
(Premise)</li>

<li id="A5">That than which no greater can be conceived is greater if
it exists in reality than if it exists only in the understanding.
(Premise)</li>

<li id="A6">It is impossible to conceive of something greater than
that than which no greater can be conceived. (Premise)</li>

<li id="A7">(So) That than which no greater can be conceived exists in
reality. (From
 <a href="#A3">iii</a>,
 <a href="#A4">iv</a>,
 <a href="#A5">v</a>,
 and
 <a href="#A6">vi</a>.)</li>
 </ol>

<p>
We can formulate a perfect island parody as follows:</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li id="i1">When the fool hears the words &lsquo;that island than
which no greater island can be conceived&rsquo; he understands those
words. (Premise)</li>

<li id="i2">Whatever is understood exists in the understanding.
(Premise)</li>

<li id="i3">(So) That island than which no greater island can be
conceived exists in the understanding. (From
 <a href="#i1">i</a>,
 <a href="#i2">ii</a>)</li>

<li id="i4">If that island than which no greater island can be
conceived exists in the understanding, it can be conceived to exist in
reality. (Premise)</li>

<li id="i5">That island than which no greater island can be conceived
is greater if it exists in reality than if it exists only in the
understanding. (Premise)</li>

<li id="i6">It is impossible to conceive of some island greater than
that island than which no greater island can be conceived.
(Premise)</li>

<li id="i7">(So) That island than which no greater island can be
conceived exists in reality. (From
 <a href="#i3">iii</a>,
 <a href="#i4">iv</a>,
 <a href="#i5">v</a>,
 and
 <a href="#i6">vi</a>.)</li>
 </ol>

<p>
Since the arguments have the same logical form, either they are both
valid or they are both invalid. If they are both invalid, then the
<em>Proslogion II</em> argument fails. If they are both valid, then,
if the <em>Proslogion II</em> argument is to succeed, there must be a
premise pair concerning which atheists and agnostics suppose that the
premise in the first argument is true but the premise in the second
argument is false. Which premise pair could that be?</p>

<p>
Arguably, not the first. Which atheists and agnostics are going to
suppose that, while the words &lsquo;that than which no greater can be
conceived&rsquo; are understood, the words &lsquo;that island than
which no greater island can be conceived&rsquo; are not understood?
(If you think that islands&mdash;unlike beings in general&mdash;do not
admit of comparison in terms of greatness, we can change the example.
The parody does not need to be formulated in terms of islands. It can,
for example, be formulated in terms of scores on a test for which
there is a maximum possible score: &lsquo;that score on this test than
which no greater score on this test can be conceived&rsquo;.)</p>

<p>
Definitely not the second, since it is the same for both
arguments.</p>

<p>
Arguably, not the third. As noted above, all we need for the purposes
of the parody is some category for which we think that existence in
reality is great-making compared to mere existence in the
understanding. It is not clear why atheists and agnostics should think
that existence in reality (as compared to existence in the
understanding) is great-making for that than which no greater can be
conceived and yet not great-making for that island than which no
greater island can be conceived. But, in any case, which atheists and
agnostics are going to accept that existence in reality (as compared
to existence in the understanding) is great-making for that than which
no greater can be conceived and yet not great-making for that score on
this test for which no greater score on this test can be
conceived?</p>

<p>
And surely not the fourth. Which atheists or agnostics would accept
that nothing is greater than that than which no greater can be
conceived and yet deny that no island is greater than that island than
which no greater can be conceived?</p>

<p>
The upshot seems pretty clear: it cannot be that Anselm&rsquo;s
<em>Proslogion II</em> argument, as formulated for the purposes of
this discussion, is a successful argument for its conclusion because
(a) it has nothing to recommend it to atheists and agnostics that does
not equally recommend the conclusion of the island parody argument to
atheists and agnostics, and yet (b) we <em>all</em> know that the
conclusion of the island parody argument is false (if not absurd).</p>

<p>
Perhaps one will object that, in the relevant sense, while we do
understand the words &lsquo;that than which no greater can be
conceived&rsquo;, we do not understand the words &lsquo;that island
than which no greater island can be conceived&rsquo;. Perhaps, for
example, we might suggest, following Plantinga, that, since we know
<em>a priori</em> that there is no intrinsic maximum for the greatness
of islands, we can attach no sense to the words &lsquo;island than
which no greater island can be conceived&rsquo;. According to
Plantinga, any island, no matter how great, can be improved by the
addition of more palm trees. While there is an intrinsic maximum for
knowledge&mdash;knowing everything&mdash;there is no intrinsic maximum
for the number of palm trees on an island. There are at least the
following three points to make here. First, it seems false that the
addition of palm trees is guaranteed to add to the greatness of an
island. For any island, there comes a point where the addition of more
palm trees overcrowds the island with palm trees, and so detracts from
its greatness. (Of course, the point here generalises to any other
kinds of things that might be taken to conduce to the greatness of
islands. There is nothing that might conduce to the greatness of
islands for which it is guaranteed that, no matter how much you have,
more will be better.) Second, the greatness of islands will inevitably
involve a trade-off between various things that contribute to
greatness of islands. We simply do not know <em>a priori</em> that
there is no distribution of these things that is an intrinsic maximum
for the greatness of islands. Third, even if these objections are
waived, until we have a satisfactory detailed theory of existence in
the understanding, conceivability, etc., we have no grounds for moving
from these points to the claim that we do not understand the words
&lsquo;that island than which no greater island can be
conceived&rsquo; when we hear them. (For more on these
responses&mdash;and for other responses&mdash;see Oppy 2017:
54&ndash;56.)</p>

<p>
The discussion to this point illustrates the general strategy that is
pursued by those who look for parodies of a given ontological
argument. Such people have been presented with an argument for the
existence of God. What they seek is an argument, with the same logical
form as the argument that has been presented to them, that has at its
conclusion either that something exists whose existence is
incompatible with the existence of God or that something exists whose
existence is recognised by all to be absurd, and yet whose premises
are all no less acceptable to those who frame the parody than the
corresponding premises in the ontological argument that has been
presented to them. (Of course, the discussion in preceding paragraphs
is an instance of the second kind: the conclusion of the argument is
something that is recognised on all hands to be absurd.)</p>

<p>
Why might someone offer a parody of an ontological argument rather
than either a criticism of the logic or premises of that ontological
argument? If someone can show that an ontological argument is invalid,
then their best objection to the ontological argument is to
demonstrate its invalidity. And, if someone can show even to
proponents of an ontological argument that the argument has one or
more false premises, then their best objection to the ontological
argument is to show the falsity of one or more of its premises. But,
often enough, an opponent of a given ontological argument may not be
able to do either of those things. However, if they can provide a
successful parody of the argument, then they still have an adequate
objection to the argument. For an argument like Anselm&rsquo;s
<em>Proslogion II</em> argument, where the background theory and the
logic are greatly underspecified, it may well be that parody offers
the most immediate way to make it clear to proponents of the argument
that there is nothing in the argument that ought to give pause to
atheists and agnostics.</p>

<p>
Even in cases where opponents of given ontological arguments suppose
that they can demonstrate invalidity or falsity of premises, there may
still be at least academic interest in parodies of those arguments.
However, it seems doubtful that there could be more than academic
interest in providing parodies in such cases.</p>

<h2 id="GeneObje">12. General Objections</h2>

<p>
Objections to ontological arguments take many forms. Some objections
are intended to apply only to particular ontological arguments, or
particular forms of ontological arguments; other objections are
intended to apply to all ontological arguments. It is a controversial
question whether there are any successful general objections to
ontological arguments.</p>

<p>
One general criticism of ontological arguments which have appeared
hitherto is this: none of them is <em>persuasive</em>, i.e., none of
them provides those who do not already accept the conclusion that God
exists&mdash;and who are reasonable, reflective, well-informed,
etc.&mdash;with either a <em>pro tanto</em> reason or an
all-things-considered reason to accept that conclusion. Any reading of
any ontological argument which has been produced so far which is
sufficiently clearly stated to admit of evaluation yields a result
which is invalid, or possesses a set of premises which it is clear in
advance that no reasonable, reflective, well-informed, etc.
non-theists should accept, or has a benign conclusion which has no
religious significance, or else falls prey to more than one of the
above failings.</p>

<p>
As we have seen in the discussion that we have given above, for each
of the families of arguments introduced in our initial taxonomy, there
are good reasons for thinking that none of the extent arguments that
belong to those families are successful.</p>

<p>
Even if the forgoing analyses are correct, it is important to note
that no argument has been given for the conclusion that no ontological
argument <em>can</em> be successful. Even if all of the kinds of
arguments produced to date are unsuccessful&mdash;i.e., not such as
ought to give non-theists reason to accept the conclusion that God
exists&mdash;it remains an open question whether there is some other
kind of hitherto undiscovered ontological argument which does succeed.
(Perhaps it is worth adding here that there is fairly widespread
consensus, even amongst theists, that no known ontological arguments
for the existence of God are successful, in the sense in which we are
here understanding what it is for an argument to be successful. Most
categories of ontological argument have some actual defenders; but
none has a large following.)</p>

<p>
Many other objections to (some) ontological arguments have been
proposed. All of the following have been alleged to be the key to the
explanation of the failure of (at least some) ontological
arguments:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>existence is not a predicate (see, e.g., Kant; Smart 1955; Alston
1960);</li>

<li>the concept of god is meaningless/incoherent/inconsistent (see,
e.g., Findlay 1948);</li>

<li>ontological arguments are ruled out by &ldquo;the missing
explanation argument&rdquo; (see Johnston 1992);</li>

<li>ontological arguments all trade on mistaken uses of singular terms
(see, e.g., Barnes 1972);</li>

<li>existence is not a perfection (see almost any textbook in
philosophy of religion);</li>

<li>ontological arguments presuppose a Meinongian approach to ontology
(see, e.g., Dummett 1983 [1993]); and</li>

<li>ontological arguments are question-begging, i.e., presuppose what
they set out to prove (see, e.g., Rowe 1989).</li>
</ol>

<p>
There are many things to say about these objections: the most
important point is that almost all of them require far more
controversial assumptions than non-theists require in order to be able
to reject ontological arguments with good conscience. Trying to
support most of these claims merely in order to beat up on ontological
arguments is unlikely to be a productive undertaking.</p>

<p>
Of course, all of the above discussion is directed only to the claim
that ontological arguments are dialectically inefficacious&mdash;i.e.,
they give reasonable non-theists no reason to change their views. It
might be wondered whether there is some other use which ontological
arguments have&mdash;e.g., as Plantinga claims, in establishing the
reasonableness of theism. This seems unlikely. After all, at best
these arguments show that certain sets of sentences (beliefs, etc.)
are inconsistent&mdash;one cannot reject the conclusions of these
arguments while accepting their premises. But the arguments themselves
say nothing about the reasonableness of accepting the premises. So the
arguments themselves say nothing about the (unconditional)
reasonableness of accepting the conclusions of these arguments. Those
who are disposed to think that theism is irrational need find nothing
in ontological arguments to make them change their minds (and those
who are disposed to think that theism is true should take no comfort
from them either).</p>

<h2 id="ConcObse">13. Concluding Observations</h2>

<p>
It will be useful to collect together some of the main points that
have been made in the preceding discussion:</p>

<ul class="jfy">

<li>There are many different extant kinds of ontological
arguments.</li>

<li>Some ontological arguments display potential entailments between
the possibility of God&rsquo;s existence (or non-existence) and the
necessity of God&rsquo;s existence (or non-existence). These
entailments put a spotlight on an open, general question: under what
conditions can one reasonably believe something of the form, &lsquo;it
is possible that <em>F</em>&rsquo; without merely deriving that
conclusion from &lsquo;it is actual that <em>F</em>&rsquo;?</li>

<li>There are significant challenges to extant ontological arguments,
and they may cast doubt on whether any current arguments provide
atheists and agnostics with good or compelling reasons to become
theists.</li>

<li>It remains an open question whether there are hitherto
undiscovered ontological arguments that would provide atheists and
agnostics with good or compelling reasons to become theists (just as
it remains an open question whether there are hitherto undiscovered
parodies of ontological arguments that would provide theists with good
or compelling reasons to become atheists or agnostics).</li>

<li>It may well be that theists have&mdash;or can have&mdash;good
reasons for thinking that there are sound ontological arguments. That
is: it may well be that there are valid ontological arguments all of
whose premises are such that theists can reasonably deem them
intuitive.</li>

<li>It remains an open question whether theists can give a plausible
account of a way in which arguments can be successful on which it
turns out that at least one extant ontological argument is successful.
&lsquo;Plausibility&rsquo; constrains the account in <em>at least</em>
the following way: it is not plausible that &lsquo;God exists and
\(2+2=4\) therefore God exists&rsquo; is a successful argument, even
though all monotheists accept that it is (classically) sound.</li>

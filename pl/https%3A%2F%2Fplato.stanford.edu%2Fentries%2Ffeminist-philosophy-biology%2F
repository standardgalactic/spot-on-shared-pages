<h1>Feminist Philosophy of Biology</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Jun 22, 2011; substantive revision Sat Apr 6, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Feminist philosophers of biology bring the tools of feminist theory,
and in particular the tools of feminist philosophy of science, to
investigations of the life sciences. While the critical examination of
the categories of sex and gender (which will be explained below) takes
a central place, the methods, ontological assumptions, and
foundational concepts of biology more generally have also enjoyed
considerable feminist scrutiny. Through such investigations, feminist
philosophers of biology reveal the extent to which the theory and
practice of particular scientific disciplines and research programs
(and, indeed, their philosophical study) are intertwined with both
value judgments and social hierarchies.</p>

<p>
This entry is divided into five sections. The introductory section (a)
discusses some of the challenges of defining feminist philosophy of
biology, (b) puts it in context and in conversation with non-feminist
philosophy of biology, and (c) defines the pivotal concepts of sex and
gender. The second section explores the variety of motivations and
epistemic perspectives found within feminist philosophy of biology. In
section three we discuss feminist analyses of some foundational
concepts within philosophy of biology and philosophy of science more
generally, such as biological determinism, reductionism, and
essentialism. The fourth section considers, in some depth, two central
examples of feminist analysis of biological research: (a) sexual
selection and (b) sociobiology/evolutionary psychology. The entry
concludes with a discussion of opportunities for further research.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="Intr">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
Feminist philosophy of biology bears much in common with non-feminist
philosophy of biology, which is highly interdisciplinary and has
unclear boundaries. Major contributors include scientists as well as
philosophers. There are two general and often closely related
approaches to the practice of philosophy of biology. First,
philosophers of biology use philosophical methods to analyze topics of
central importance in the biological sciences, such as natural
selection, fitness, adaptation, and the nature of genes. Second,
philosophy of biology addresses central topics in the philosophy of
science, such as reductionism, laws of nature, and theory change, from
the perspective of the biological sciences instead of physics as is
more traditional in philosophy of science. Philosophy of biology is
often informed by a naturalistic approach, meaning that the work is
closely tied to the actual history and practice of the science in
question. It is not uncommon for philosophers of biology, at least at
some point during their careers, to become significantly involved with
the science itself, either in terms of conducting biological research
or collaborating with biologists on research or pedagogical
projects.</p>

<p>
The boundaries of feminist philosophy of biology are similarly fuzzy.
It is not clear whether many of the authors cited in this entry would
primarily consider themselves philosophers of biology, science studies
scholars, or scientists. Moreover, biologists and philosophers with
other distinct but related progressive political commitments (e.g.,
Richard Lewontin and Stephen Jay Gould) have offered critiques of
various mainstream projects that share much with feminist criticisms
and some philosophers might be identified with either camp (e.g., John
Dupr&eacute; and Helen Longino). This blurring of the line between
feminist and nonfeminist philosophy of biology is increasingly the
case, as many critiques of biology and philosophy of science by
feminists are increasingly accepted by the mainstream. Not
surprisingly, the two general approaches to philosophy of biology are
also advanced in feminist philosophy of biology.</p>

<p>
First, many feminist philosophers of biology are concerned with
biological concepts and knowledge claims, particularly regarding sex
and gender (see the entry on
 <a href="../feminism-gender/">feminist perspectives on sex and gender</a>),
 as well as the influence of gender ideology on biological research.
Due to the importance of these concepts to what follows and the
frequent confusions and controversies associated with them, it is
worth clarifying what exactly we mean by them. In no small part
informed by queer theorists like Judith Butler (1990), the categories
of sex and gender themselves, as well as their relationship with
sexuality, have become increasingly contentious. Here, we adopt Sari
van Anders&rsquo; definitions of gender, sex, and gender/sex
(2015).</p>

<p>
As a self-identified feminist neuroendocrinologist, van Anders&rsquo;
approach starts from a commitment to both anti-oppression goals and
scientific rigor. Dissatisfied with simplistic measures of sexual
orientation, like the Kinsey scale, she specifies a series of distinct
measures that comprise an individual&rsquo;s sexual configuration.
Among these are sex, gender, and gender/sex. Sex roughly captures
biological, bodily features that are related to evolved reproductive
role. Importantly, this is not a binary category but admits of
considerable variation (including trans people) even as male and
female define the conceptual starting point (2015, Table 2; 1190).
Gender captures &ldquo;[a]spects of masculinity, femininity, and
gender-diversity that are situated as socialized, learned, and
cultural&rdquo; (2015, Table 2).</p>

<p>
To these standard definitions and in deference to both the
developmental interactions between the biological and the social and
the experiential realities of our own bodies, van Anders adds
gender/sex, which captures,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[w]hole people/identities and/or aspects of women, men, and people
that relate to identity and/or cannot really be sourced specifically
to sex or gender. (2015, Table 2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Clearly, the first measure, sex, can be applied to all sexual
organisms (though van Anders&rsquo; focus is strictly on the human).
Whether the concepts of gender and gender/sex admit of nonhuman
applications is considerably more controversial, though Meynell and
Lopez have argued that they may (2021). The matter of the sex (or,
indeed, gender) of desired or actual partners in sexual activity is a
separate axis of sexual configuration from the individual&rsquo;s sex,
gender, or gender/sex. Van Anders&rsquo; work exemplifies the kind of
novelty, subtlety, and rigor, that a careful development of biological
concepts driven by the insights and anti-oppression commitments of
feminist theory can produce, as well as shoring up contentious terms
by delineating their scope and adding a third category for the many
ambiguous cases that confront us. Importantly, and consistent with her
commitment to inclusivity and justice, the operational definitions of
gender/sex and sex both include trans categories (as, of course, does
gender) (2015, Table 2).</p>

<p>
Though not all feminist philosophers of biology adopt van
Anders&rsquo; approach, the vast majority are alive to the
impossibility of sharply demarcating sex and gender for biologically
cultural animals like humans. With sophisticated accounts of sexual
diversity in hand, feminist analysis is often performed as a control
(in a sense to be explained below) to test for the unrecognized
influence of traditional or pernicious gender politics and ideology on
the production of knowledge, in existing knowledge claims, and in the
choices of research projects. These gender values can include sexism
(devaluation, in practice primarily of women, based on traditional
stereotypes of gender roles) and androcentrism (a focus on men or
males and the neglect or exclusion of women, females, or other
non-men/males), but extend to the imposition of a sex binary on sexual
organisms or the disappearance of those sexual phenomena that do not
neatly fit the binary.</p>

<p>
As we will explain in more detail below, feminist investigations of
the relationships between gender values, and the practices and
products of the biological sciences can take place in a range of
epistemological projects. Some projects focus on removing gender bias;
others focus on developing an understanding of the role of social
values, including gender values, in biological research; and others,
like van Anders&rsquo;, attempt to reconfigure basic concepts and
change how science is done. Many of these projects engage specific
cases or research programs in the life sciences and there is a degree
of overlap between feminist philosophy of biology and various feminist
critiques of medicine, psychology, and the social sciences.</p>

<p>
Similarly, the second central project in non-feminist philosophy of
biology&mdash;consideration of foundational topics in biology,
philosophy of biology and philosophy of science&mdash;is also
addressed by feminists, albeit typically with a focus on whether these
topics are gendered or otherwise incompatible with or unfriendly to
feminist insights. Discussions that contextualize the complex relation
between sex and gender in terms of nature and nurture more generally
(e.g., Keller 2010) exemplify this research as do feminist critiques
of reductionism, determinism, essentialism (see
 <a href="#DeteReduEsse">section 3.1</a>)
 and the nature of objectivity (see the entry on
 <a href="../feminism-epistemology/">feminist epistemology and philosophy of science</a>).
 As we will discuss below, some feminist philosophers of biology
contend that gendered (and other) values are not only historically
intertwined with particular theories or knowledge claims, but,
epistemically also support and are supported by them (Fehr 2004;
Longino 1990). When feminists first tackled these issues in the 1970s,
1980s, and 1990s, their arguments and approaches were often rejected,
ignored, or derided, but a number of these views are now widely
accepted in the mainstream of philosophy of biology. There is also
significant feminist work regarding scientific objectivity that is at
least partially motivated by the presence and power of unacknowledged
gendered assumptions, including androcentrism and sexism, in
biological sciences ranging from genetics and cell biology, to
sociobiology (for example Keller 1985; Longino 1990, 2002; Haraway
1989; Harding 1986). This has grounded a larger discussion of the role
of values in the sciences, which were, traditionally, lauded as
&ldquo;value-free&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="MotiEpisPersMeth">2. Motivations, Epistemic Perspectives, and Methods</h2>

<h3 id="Moti">2.1 Motivations</h3>

<p>
Work in feminist philosophy of biology can be motivated by a number
of, often interrelated, goals. These include countering biological
arguments supporting women&rsquo;s (and others&rsquo;) oppression,
correcting essentialist approaches in the life sciences that elide the
true diversity that exists within a given species, especially with
respect to gender, sex, and gender/sex and facilitating the production
of maximally accurate and ethically responsible accounts of female
biology and gendered topics of study in the biological sciences.
Feminist philosophers of biology also engage parallel and intersecting
issues related to axes of oppression beyond sex and gender (see, e.g.,
Gannett 2004).</p>

<h4>2.1.1 Anti-oppression motivations</h4>

<p>
The science of biology is of importance to many feminists because
women&rsquo;s biology has been used to rationalize women&rsquo;s
oppression. There is a wide range of biological arguments supporting
the oppression of women. Take for example Edward H. Clarke&rsquo;s
nineteenth century argument that intensive study would physically harm
women by diverting energy from their uteruses to their brains. He
claimed that higher education would result in women with
&ldquo;monstrous brains and puny bodies &hellip; [and] abnormally weak
digestion&rdquo; (Clarke 1874: 41). Of course, the development of
biological theories to explain and tacitly justify the subjection of
women long precedes this (see Schiebinger 1989, esp. Ch. 10) and can,
indeed, be traced back to Aristotle (Deslauriers 2022).
Unsurprisingly, this kind of argument regarding women&rsquo;s
&ldquo;natural&rdquo; inferiority has been a focus of feminist
philosophy of biology (see for example Hubbard 1990). Similarly,
evolutionary arguments that can provide foundational support for
sexist or oppressive practices, for example, arguments for the
adaptive nature of violence against women (see Thornhill &amp; Palmer
2000 for a readable account of this research program), have drawn
intense feminist scrutiny (for example see papers in Travis 2003a).
Harvard past-president Lawrence Summers was not the first person to
use biological arguments about the different distributions of
intelligence among men and women to justify the absence of women from
positions of social power and from higher powered careers (Wilson
1978; Summers 2005). Here also, there is a significant feminist
response (Bleier 1984; Fausto-Sterling 1985 [1992]; Fehr 2008).</p>

<h4>2.1.2 Against dimorphism</h4>

<p>
Feminists have pointed out that much of the political power of these
sorts of biological arguments arises from problematic assumptions
about dimorphism grounded in essentialism and determinism (see
 <a href="#DeteReduEsse">section 3.1</a>).
 Two distinct (even &ldquo;opposite&rdquo; or complementary) sexes are
simply assumed and any apparent continuity between them, such as
people with various intersex conditions, is either denied or treated
as an exception that proves the rule (Fausto-Sterling 2000b;
Jordan-Young 2010). A close connection between female biology&mdash;in
terms of genes, hormones, and physiology&mdash;and women&rsquo;s
psychological attributes and social positions are also assumed,
effectively collapsing traits best understood as gender/sex or even
gender traits (such as toy preference, see Meynell 2012) into
biologically determined sex traits. The general notion is that
biology, as opposed to culture, is monolithic, admitting of no real
variation, and fixed. As a result some contend that any political
activity designed to change or improve women&rsquo;s condition is
trying to create an &ldquo;unnatural&rdquo; system that is doomed to
fail. This position, while common in nineteenth and early twentieth
century biology, can still be found in the work of some more
contemporary biologists, including some early and influential work in
sociobiology (Wilson 1978) and much contemporary evolutionary
psychology (see
 <a href="#SociPsyc">section 4.2</a>,
 below). As a result, feminists have been strongly motivated to
analyze particular claims about female biology, to interrogate the
assumption that genetic or biological nature implies fixity, and to
reveal the wide range of interacting biological and social causes of
women&rsquo;s (and others&rsquo;) phenotypes, including their
psychological attributes and social positions. In
 <a href="#ConcThemFemiPhilBiol">section 3</a>
 we will discuss biological determinism and essentialism in more
detail.</p>

<h4>2.1.3 Getting the biology right</h4>

<p>
Finally, much feminist philosophy of biology is also very concerned
with getting the biology right. Many feminist philosophers of biology
were initially trained as scientists and are interested not just in
critiquing, but also in improving the practice of science, especially
as it relates to sex, gender, and gender/sex. Feminist philosophers
have documented the impact of feminism on improving the practices of
the biological sciences. For example, Donna Haraway&rsquo;s book
<em>Primate Visions</em> (1989) documents the influence that the
incorporation of feminist women in primatology had on the study of
primate behavior and animal behavior more generally. Haraway shows
that feminist primatologist Jeanne Altmann, instigated a quiet but
powerful methodological revolution. In one of the most cited papers in
the study of animal behavior, &ldquo;Observational study of behavior:
Sampling methods&rdquo; (1974), Altmann evaluated a range of sampling
methods and in doing so developed a method, focal-animal sampling,
that undermined previous research generating sexist accounts of
leadership and control, and enabled research on female primates and on
novel topics such as mothering. Altmann, troubled by the androcentrism
and less than rigorous methodologies that she found in primatology,
brought her perspectives as a woman, a feminist, a mother, and a
mathematically trained scientist to bear on improving research
methods. Focal animal sampling provides an effective method for
studying the social behavior of female primates and has become an
important approach in animal behavior research in general.
Haraway&rsquo;s description of Altmann&rsquo;s contributions to
primatology and animal behavior provides an example of the positive
impact of feminism and feminist scientists on the practices and
products of scientific research (see also Strum &amp; Fedigan
2000).</p>

<p>
In sum, motivations for conducting research in feminist philosophy of
biology include the drive to challenge biological justifications of
women&rsquo;s oppression, including the dimorphic assumptions upon
which they rest, and improve the practices and products of biological
research, particularly on sex, gender, and gender/sex.</p>

<h3 id="EpisPers">2.2 Epistemological Perspectives</h3>

<p>
Getting the biology &ldquo;right&rdquo; can mean different things and
there is a range of epistemological positions and objectives held by
feminist philosophers of biology. Objectives include revealing gender
bias in biological accounts of sex and gender, analyzing science as a
social, value-laden practice, and exploring how the social and
material situation of biologists affects knowledge production.
Importantly, this includes challenging pervasive traditional
ontological assumptions about dimorphism and the inevitability of
women&rsquo;s inferior social status as well as providing ontological
frameworks, research questions, and methods that produce more
accurate, more rigorous, and less politically pernicious science.
Since early work on feminism and science tended to focus on the life
sciences, much of the feminist philosophy of biology produced in the
1980s and 1990s helped to shape and inform both feminist philosophy of
science and feminist epistemology (see entry on
 <a href="../feminism-epistemology/">feminist epistemology and philosophy of science</a>).</p>
 
<h4>2.2.1 Bias</h4>

<p>
The largest body of work in feminist philosophy of biology concerns
revealing sexist and androcentric bias with the goal of eliminating
it. Central and early work in the field documented the presence of
assumptions of female passivity and male activity in a wide range of
biological accounts of sex and gender. Examples include critique of
research on sex determination (Birke 1986; Bleier 1984), fertilization
(Martin 1991), human evolution (Bleier 1984; Fausto-Sterling 1985
[1992]; Hubbard 1990) and the discipline of primatology (Hrdy 1986,
1997, and Haraway 1989). (The ubiquity of this trope might owe
something to its Aristotelian origins [Deslauriers 2022]). Feminist
research on sexist bias in biology focuses on eliminating myths of
female biology that are colored by contemporary social values and
facilitating the production of biological research that more
accurately reveals the facts about sex, gender, and gender/sex. In
this sense a feminist perspective is seen as a sort of control, with
the goal of removing bias&mdash;specifically sexist and androcentric
social values&mdash;from scientific research. For example, the Biology
and Gender Study Group (1988: 61&ndash;62) write that,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We have come to look at feminist critique as we would any other
experimental control. Whenever one performs an experiment, one sets up
all the controls one can think of in order to make as certain as
possible that the result obtained does not come from any other source.
One asks oneself what assumptions one is making. Have I assumed the
temperature to be constant? Have I assumed that the pH doesn&rsquo;t
change over the time of the reaction? Feminist critique asks if there
may be some assumptions that we haven&rsquo;t checked concerning
gender bias. In this way feminist critique should be part of normative
science. Like any control, it seeks to provide critical rigor, and to
ignore this critique is to ignore a possible source of error.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The Biology and Gender Study Group (BGSG) point out that old models of
sex determination simply assumed that female developmental patterns
were neutral and passive, while male developmental patterns required
some sort of active switch to initiate their development (1988). They
refer with approval to the 1980s work of Eva Eicher and Linda
Washburn, who created a developmental model that did not make the
sexist assumption of female passivity <em>and</em> was based on
genetic evidence. In this model both male and female development had
passive and active components. Further, Eicher and Washburn
demonstrate that although there had been significant research on
testes determination, there had been practically no work on ovary
determination. As a result of this androcentrism, claims about the
passivity of female sexual development were made in the absence of
evidence. The BGSG sees Eicher and Washburn as an example of a
feminist-influenced critique of cell and molecular biology because
they controlled for gender bias. This allowed them to be &ldquo;open
to different interpretations of one&rsquo;s data&rdquo; and gave them
&ldquo;the ability to ask questions that would not have occurred
within the traditional context&rdquo; (1988: 68). This focus on bias
more or less conforms to Sandra Harding&rsquo;s notion of spontaneous
feminist empiricism (1986); it leaves traditional scientific
epistemology more or less intact, merely adding a new control and
urging scientists to do better by their own standards.</p>

<p>
This approach is considered insufficient by many feminist philosophers
(see the entry on
 <a href="../feminism-epistemology/">feminist epistemology and philosophy of science</a>).
 Sarah Richardson (2010), for one, is critical of tendencies to focus
solely on revealing and removing bias, while acknowledging the value
of case studies of gender bias. She points out that there is
institutional pressure to work on bias. Because it has been customary
in the philosophy of science to see good science as value neutral,
analyses of bias fall clearly within a traditional philosophical
approach. However, even in the face of these professional incentives,
she argues that a primary or sole focus on bias is a limiting
epistemic position. It fails to take into account feminist work, in
epistemology and philosophy of science, that considers <em>how</em>
values, including gender values, not only limit but also facilitate
knowledge production. Such an account complicates the traditional view
that values should be identified solely in order to guard against
their impact and leads to a second epistemic perspective, analyses of
science as a social value-laden practice.</p>

<h4>2.2.2 Science as a social value-laden practice</h4>

<p>
Helen Longino has developed an influential social account of
scientific knowledge production, critical contextual empiricism (1990,
2002). This view is informed by her early work with Ruth Doell
(Longino &amp; Doell 1983) on a case study of biological models of the
role of hormones in the development of sexual behavior. Longino points
out that there is an inferential gap between a theory and the evidence
researchers use to assess that theory. She argues that researchers
close the gap between evidence and theories with background
assumptions of which they may not be aware. Background assumptions
include both epistemic and contextual values, and contextual values
can include gendered social values (and, of course, those associated
with other axes of oppression). She argues that scientific communities
maximize objectivity and justification when they include members who
differ from one another in terms of the background assumptions they
hold and take dissenting views seriously. This diversity of critical
perspectives facilitates awareness and critical evaluation of the
background assumptions (including those that are sexist and
androcentric) that inform research practices. Communities can then
decide whether or not those assumptions are acceptable given their
research goals. Using examples including the evolution of human sex
differences, behavioral endocrinology, and neurobiology, Longino
demonstrates that gendered assumptions structure a range of research
programs in biology. She writes</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The long standing devaluation of women&rsquo;s voices and those of
members of racial minorities means that such [racist and sexist]
assumptions have been protected from critical scrutiny. (1990:
78&ndash;79)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The implication is that these racist and sexist assumptions, had they
received critical scrutiny, would have been deemed unacceptable. The
importance of non-epistemic values in science has, increasingly, been
embraced by non-feminist philosophers of biology (e.g., Kitcher 2001;
Reydon &amp; Ereshefsky 2022), though there have long been politicized
progressive voices in philosophy of biology interested in tackling the
role of these values in the biological sciences (e.g., Gould 1981;
Hull 1986; Lewontin 1992; Dupr&eacute; 1993).</p>

<p>
Treating science as a value-laden practice also prompts us to question
whose interests are served by our scientific projects and practices
and how science would be different in more just social relations.
These kinds of considerations take many different forms, depending on
the research in question, and work in this area often further blurs
the boundaries of philosophy of biology, reaching towards other
sciences, such as archaeology and medicine. For instance, Alison Wylie
has shown how collaborative research with Indigenous communities can
enrich both the evidential base and critical standards of various
research projects involving Indigenous research subjects, while better
serving the goals of Indigenous people (2015). As another example,
Kristen Intemann and Inmaculada de Melo-Mart&iacute;n use the case of
HPV vaccine research to show how the aims of research influence the
definition of the research problem, evidentiary standards, and
methodology (2010). As yet another example, Fran&ccedil;oise Baylis
has argued that, given the implications for the future evolution of
our species, human gene editing that may affect the germ-line should
be limited and guided by values and policies reflecting a broad
societal consensus (2019).</p>

<h4>2.2.3 Situated knowledge</h4>

<p>
Donna Haraway introduced the concept of &ldquo;situated
knowledge&rdquo;, an idea that has become very influential in academic
feminism, including feminist epistemology (1988). In her book
<em>Primate Visions</em> (1989) she explores the ways that primatology
constructs political narratives about the categories of nature,
gender, and race, and the ways that those categories are integrated
with particular perspectives situated in social and material
locations. She also reveals the ways that feminist primatologists have
turned primatology into what some call a feminist science (see also
Fedigan 1997).</p>

<p>
Treating knowledge as situated undermines the idea of a generic
epistemic subject who, through using scientific methods, can inhabit
an impartial view from nowhere. The knowing subject, including the
biologist, is recognized as culturally located and embodied, meaning
that one has a particular material, historical, and social location
(for example one&rsquo;s location can include being a woman, feminist,
scientist, Anglo American, heterosexual,&hellip;). This means the
perspectives from which we know and the knowledge we produce are
partial, both in the sense of being incomplete and in the sense of
being infused with one&rsquo;s own peculiar interests and preferences.
One&rsquo;s perspective does not just influence one&rsquo;s interests,
the questions one asks and the methods, theories and strategies that
one uses to answer those questions; it also influences one&rsquo;s
ontology, in terms of the objects and kinds of things that one
investigates.</p>

<p>
The point here is not just that feminist perspectives are partial but
that non-feminist perspectives are partial too. Indeed, even a
generally accepted and well-evidenced theory may turn out to be
profoundly flawed, resting on politically pernicious or empirically
dubious assumptions, if these assumptions are shared by all rival
hypotheses. Kathleen Okruhlik&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gender and the Biological
Sciences&rdquo; (1994) neatly demonstrates the inadequacy of the
widely held view that empirical methods, carefully applied, can
protect scientific results from being infected by biases. This view
implies that feminist scruples can be disregarded, so long as one
carefully attends to the observed facts and ensures that the theory
one adopts best accounts for the observations. To illustrate the
point, Okruhlik suggests we consider the possibility that, within a
patriarchal society, all proposed theories of female behavior might be
infused by sexism. In such a society,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[n]on-sexist [rival hypotheses] will never even be generated. Hence
the theory which is selected by the canons of scientific appraisal
will simply be the best of the sexist rivals; and the very
<em>content</em> of science will be sexist, no matter how rigorously
we apply objective standards of assessment in the context of
justification. In fact, the best of the sexist theories will emerge
more and more highly <em>confirmed</em> after successive tests. (1994
[1998: 202])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Whereas traditional non-feminist views of objectivity position such
partiality as a flaw to be overcome to the greatest degree possible,
feminists view situatedness as an unavoidable epistemic reality that
can be pernicious or productive, but can only do mischief when it is
ignored or denied. We can see a productive kind of situated knowledge
in Jeanne Altmann&rsquo;s working from the perspective of a woman, a
mother, and a feminist to develop methodologies that allowed for the
systematic study of the often low-drama interactions among female
primates and between mothers and their offspring. Another example from
<em>Primate Visions</em> (Haraway 1989) is Adrienne Zihlman&rsquo;s
critique of associations of sexual dimorphism with, usually male,
dominance. Zihlman, who is best known for her development, with Nancy
Tanner, of Woman the Gatherer theory of early human evolution,
consciously developed a feminist stance toward gender and science.
Zihlman argued that sexual dimorphism was not a unitary phenomenon.
Different species can be sexually dimorphic not only to different
degrees, but in different ways, including bone length and structure,
tendencies to build muscle or fat tissue, and/or canine size. These
different kinds of sexual dimorphism can be related to differences in
aggressive capacities and differences in foraging strategies, both of
which had been associated with evolutionary accounts of gender
differences. Zihlman&rsquo;s stance as a feminist scientist allowed
her to focus on heterogeneity and complexity of sexual dimorphism and
undermined associations of general sexual dimorphism with male
dominance.</p>

<p>
The appreciation of the inescapable partiality and situatedness of
knowledge grounds a widespread epistemic pluralism among feminist
philosophers of biology. This arises not only out the recognition of
the different social and epistemic contexts in which research is
conducted, but also the complexity, contingency, and heterogeneity of
biological phenomena themselves (discussed in the next section).
Feminist philosophers of biology are often willing to countenance
multiple explanations for the same phenomena and may see this as a
virtue that arises from attending to these ontological and/or
epistemic possibilities (assuming, of course, that the explanations
are well-formulated and well-evidenced) (Longino 2002; Fehr 2004). For
example, feminists have critiqued &ldquo;man-the-hunter&rdquo;
theories of human evolution because they focus on a single cause,
hunting, of a complex and varied evolutionary history (Bleier 1984).
They point out that while hunting played a role, gathering was likely
the primary source of nutrition, and that the reciprocal interaction
of many factors, such as the development of language and culture,
likely played important roles in the evolution of human beings.</p>

<p>
As discussed in this section, epistemic perspectives in feminist
philosophy of biology range across work on gender bias, considerations
of biology a social and value-laden practice, and the idea of situated
knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="ConcThemFemiPhilBiol">3. Conceptual Themes in Feminist Philosophy of Biology</h2>

<h3 id="DeteReduEsse">3.1 Determinism, Reductionism, and Essentialism</h3>

<p>
Although determinism, reductionism, and essentialism are conceptually
distinct, they often work together as ontological assumptions
grounding methodological and interpretative approaches in the
biological research programs that inspire and deserve feminist
critique. Determinism can be broadly construed simply to mean that
every event is determined by some prior set of causes, rather than,
say, being the result of mere chance. However, the cases that
typically interest feminist philosophers of biology are those in which
a single causal factor (or a small set of well-circumscribed factors)
is treated as the only relevant or interesting cause of a given
effect. This tends to go along with the implication that the causal
factor and its inevitable effect are, in some sense, essential to the
organism&mdash;so much so that, in some cases, even when the effect is
not present, it along with its putative cause are nonetheless taken to
determine the true essence of the organism and the absent effect is
asserted to be in some sense present, albeit in a suppressed or
distorted form. These essential causal determinants are almost always
thought to be internal to the organism and are thus treated
reductively. Genes, chromosomes, hormones, and brains are taken to
determine our sexually dimorphic human nature, and, indeed, nonhuman
natures too. Environmental influences such as local ecology, learning,
and social structures are undervalued or treated as noise obscuring
the &ldquo;real&rdquo; or &ldquo;important&rdquo; causes.</p>

<p>
Regarding genetics and molecular biology, researchers such as Evelyn
Fox Keller (2000), Bonnie Spanier (1995) Ruth Hubbard (1990) and Anne
Fausto-Sterling (1985 [1992]) have pointed out the logical and
empirical distance between an organism having a particular genotype
and expressing a particular phenotype, including behaviors.
Non-feminist philosophers of biology have also developed criticisms of
biological determinism (an influential example is Richard
Lewontin&rsquo;s book <em>Biology as Ideology</em> [1992]) and this
rejection of reductive determinism has become increasingly mainstream
through the developmental turn of biological research programs like
developmental systems theory and evo-devo (see entries on
 <a href="../evolution-development/">evolution and development</a>;
 <a href="../biology-philosophy/">philosophy of biology</a>;
 <a href="../reduction-biology/">reductionism in biology</a>;
 and
 <a href="../theories-biological-development/">theories of biological development</a>).</p>
 
<p>
At the heart of this critique is a rejection of a deterministic view
of the causal relationship between genes and the particular proteins
that result in phenotypes, called the Central Dogma. According to
common descriptions of the Central Dogma, information flows from DNA
to RNA to protein, and not in the other direction. DNA specifies
messenger RNA in a process called transcription. Messenger RNA plays a
role in specifying the amino acid sequence of a protein. Feminist and
non-feminist philosophers of biology, along with many biologists, have
pointed out that this causal chain is extremely complicated and that a
particular genotype can result in different phenotypes in different
contexts. There are gene regulation mechanisms that turn genes on and
off, and control the rate of transcription. There are hereditary
mechanisms whereby once a portion of DNA is rendered inactive in a
cell it remains inactive in all of that cell&rsquo;s descendants. The
cellular environment affects what DNA is transcribed and the fate of
particular DNA transcripts. A sequence of DNA does not uniquely
specify a particular protein. The machinery of the cell processes the
RNA transcript. During this processing different portions of an RNA
strand can be spliced out resulting in different end products, which
means that the same DNA sequence can result in different proteins and
different phenotypic traits. The nature of the relationship between a
sequence of DNA and the traits of an organism is complicated. Although
genes make a difference in an organism&rsquo;s phenotype, they are not
the sole causes determining that phenotype. Simple pictures of genetic
determinism are not supported by molecular biology.</p>

<p>
These insights about the contingency of genetic expression are often
passed over in evolutionary explanations. However, it is clear that
even if a trait is the result of evolution by natural selection, or in
other words is an adaptation, it does not follow that the trait is
uniformly expressed in a population or static in an individual over
time. In addition to this, some adaptive traits are almost always
present and others require very specific environmental conditions in
order to develop. One could have the genetic correlate of a trait and
that trait could be the result of natural selection, and yet changing
the environment could eliminate the expression of that trait.
Moreover, many traits admit of a range of different possible
expressions depending on the developmental context. Some, including
feminists, have pointed to the importance of these &ldquo;norms of
reaction&rdquo; for understanding the diversity found within
populations and appreciating their contingency (Fausto-Sterling 1997;
Meynell 2008; Jordan-Young 2010).</p>

<p>
The diversity of populations is not only driven by developmental
contingencies but evolutionary processes also. This may seem
paradoxical given that natural selection explanations, though
stochastic from generation to generation, are often treated
deterministically over evolutionary time, producing the adaptations
that are considered characteristic of a particular species. However,
some traits have adapted to past environmental conditions and
don&rsquo;t enhance the fitness of their bearers in current
conditions. Under non-selective conditions, traits tend to diversify,
as random mutations that are adaptively neutral multiply over
generations. Some traits give their bearers a fitness advantage, but
are not the result of natural selection and hence are not adaptations.
Some of these may be by-products of other selection processes.
Elisabeth Lloyd has made a compelling argument that the (human) female
orgasm is one such case&mdash;a &ldquo;fantastic bonus&rdquo; of the
selection pressures on male orgasm and the developmental homology of
the penis and clitoris (2005). In her book, <em>The Case of the Female
Orgasm</em>, Lloyd takes on multiple natural selection accounts,
claiming they are androcentric&mdash;assuming, contra the evidence,
that female sexual response mirrors that of males&mdash;and
adaptationist&mdash;rejecting out of hand the possibility that an
interesting trait, like the female orgasm, could be anything other
than the result of natural selection. Simple, reductive, deterministic
stories of the &ldquo;function&rdquo; of the female orgasm belie the
complexity, contingency and diversity of this trait in the human
species. Finally, it is worth remembering that natural selection
itself can only work on a population that is diverse enough to have
traits that are sufficiently distinct that there is a fitness
difference between them. Reductionist, determinist, and essentialist
explanations are thus not supported by evolutionary biology,
developmental biology, or genetics. Any apparent gap between nature
and nurture can justly be considered a &ldquo;mirage&rdquo; (Keller
2010) and any accounts of a static and universal &ldquo;nature&rdquo;
of a given species (or sex) should be considered suspect until proven
otherwise.</p>

<p>
Similar reductionist, determinist research programs can be found in
sex difference research, which reaches from chromosomes to hormones to
brains and behavior. This research typically assumes sex dimorphism
and then seeks data to confirm it. Often, despite the existence of
multiple members of the population who defy easy classification as
either male or female (however these are being defined in the
particular study at hand) and despite the data revealing considerable
overlap between the sexes in whatever is being measured, the results
are interpreted as revealing two essentially different kinds: the male
chromosome and the female chromosome; male hormones and female
hormones; the male brain and the female brain.</p>

<p>
Sarah Richardson in <em>Sex Itself: The Search for Male and Female in
the Human Genome</em> (2013), reveals the way that &ldquo;gender
valences&rdquo; have informed the discovery and study of sex
chromosomes. Episodes in this history include the rise and fall of the
XYY &ldquo;supermale&rdquo; (2013: 81&ndash;102) and the mosaicism of
those with two X chromosomes (one of which must be &ldquo;turned
off&rdquo; in each cell) being charged with creating beings who are
&ldquo;mysterious, contradictory, complicated, emotional and
changeable&rdquo; (2013: 109).</p>

<p>
The story of sex chromosomes is intimately linked with sex hormones,
brains, and behavior (Birke 1986; Longino &amp; Doell 1983; Longino
1990). In an early model of the role of hormones in rat development,
which Longino and Doell called the linear-hormonal model, prenatal and
perinatal hormone levels are assumed to be the basis for behavioral
sex differences. The assumption is that a gene on the Y chromosome
triggers the development of testes, and that the hormones released by
these brand new testes affect the structure of the rodent brain during
a critical developmental period. The presence of testes and the
hormones that they produce were assumed to cause the male brain to
develop such that the male performs &ldquo;stereotypical&rdquo; male
sexual behavior; in the absence of testes and the hormones that they
produce the female brain develops in such a way as to cause the female
to perform &ldquo;stereotypical&rdquo; female behavior. Longino points
out that in this explanatory model it is assumed that there is a
&ldquo;unidirectional and irreversible sequence of (biochemical)
events&rdquo; (Longino 1990: 135) and, as we will see, it continues to
shape brain organization theory (discussed below).</p>

<p>
Rejecting the linear-hormonal model, Birke was an early defender of an
interactionist model. She points out that research is beginning to
embrace a much more complex picture of the causes of sexual behavior,
a picture that involves interactions among the mother, the fetus, the
physiological and social environment as well as the genes, the
internal anatomy and the brain structure of the developing fetus. Rat
fetuses are influenced by factors such as the sex of other members of
the litter, the mother&rsquo;s environment, and the mother&rsquo;s
hormonal states. Birke writes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Even before birth&hellip; it is difficult to separate the individual
pup and its hormones from a network of complex processes. (Birke 1986:
97)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
After birth, factors such as the pup&rsquo;s own hormones, maternal
care (which is differential depending on the sex of the pup), the
physical environment and the other pups influence adult sexual
behavior. When the pup becomes an adult, factors in its physical and
social environment as well as its hormonal states and its own behavior
influence its sexual behavior. The interactionist model does not
ignore low level causes, such as genes or hormones, it simply refuses
to privilege them over what may be thought of as higher level
environmental and social causes of behavior.</p>

<p>
More recently, Sari van Anders, Jeffrey Steiger, and Katherine Goldey
have put interactionist views to the test, investigating
&ldquo;gender&rarr;testosterone pathways, highlighting
the&hellip;effects of socialization on human biology&rdquo; (2015:
13805). Measuring changes in testosterone levels in men and women
after &ldquo;wielding power&rdquo; in &ldquo;gender-stereotypical
ways&rdquo;, they found that &ldquo;wielding power significantly
increased testosterone regardless of how it was done&rdquo; (2015:
13807), at least in women. These results suggest that the
linear-hormonal model is inadequate as sex-typical behaviors acquired
through gender socialization (like competition and wielding power)
&ldquo;can contribute to variation in human testosterone levels&rdquo;
(2015: 13808).</p>

<p>
Uniting many sex difference research programs is an assumption that
gendered behavior is caused by differences between male and female
brains. There is a long history of feminist engagement with biology
that has been used to support determinist arguments involving
differences in male and female brains, and the effects of sex hormones
on the expression of behavioral traits. Much recent work in this area
has come to be known as neurofeminism (though not everyone employs
this moniker), which includes the feminist practice of neuroscience
and feminist scholarship on neuroscience (Fine 2010; Bluhm et al.
2012; Schmitz &amp; H&ouml;ppner 2014; Rippon 2019). Neurofeminism,
like other areas of feminist philosophy of biology, has both critical
and constructive elements and includes research on the influence of
gendered social values on neuroscience and ways that neuroscientific
research reifies harmful gendered social values and structures.</p>

<p>
Feminist interventions in brain science involve careful analysis of
studies used to support determinist arguments. Bleier (1984), in
classic work in this area, demonstrates the futility of separating
nature from nurture, or in other words the structural and hormonal
aspects of brain development from social learning and environmental
influences on brain development. She points out that the fetal and
postnatal development of the brain is highly influenced by
environmental inputs, that humans are very good at learning, and that
the human brain exhibits high levels of developmental plasticity.
Plasticity remains an important area of neurofeminist research
(Schmitz &amp; H&ouml;ppner 2014). Responding to the increasing number
of studies since the 1980s and 90s showing the biology of the brain
responding to cultural and social forces over the course of a
person&rsquo;s life, neurofeminists argue that notions of genetic or
evolutionary neuroscientific determinism are untenable. For example,
DesAutels (2015) argues that observed sex differences in judgments,
behaviors, and traits are better explained by differences in the
psychologies of people who are in oppressed or oppressing groups,
rather than sex-based brain differences.</p>

<p>
Feminist philosophers of biology, such as Bleier (1984) and
Fausto-Sterling (1985 [1992]), reveal a series of problems with
studies that purport to find sex differences in brain anatomy, brain
lateralization, and hormones that are correlated with gender
differences in behavioral traits and abilities. These critiques
include pointing out that (1) for most of the behavioral traits in
question there is more overlap than difference among populations of
men and women, (2) these studies are often based on limited data and
insufficient sample sizes, (3) these studies often involve unwarranted
extrapolation from rodent models to humans, (4) there are complexities
to the biological conversion of androgens to estrogens in the body
that make it difficult to interpret <em>in vivo</em> experiments, and
finally (5) there is a tendency to discount social causes of putative
differences between the sexes (see also Fehr 2004). More recently
Robyn Bluhm&rsquo;s (2013a, 2013b) careful analysis of fMRI research
on sex differences in the expression and control of human emotion
reveals problematic methods, data, and evidential inferences in a
research program strongly influenced by gender stereotypes.</p>

<p>
The reductive, determinist, essentialist tendencies of sex difference
research are nowhere more pronounced than in brain organization
theory, which repeats the linear-hormonal model. Its central
assumption is that the hormonal cascade, triggered by chromosome
differences, that shape genitals into two distinct forms <em>in
utero</em> also produces two types of brains&mdash;male and
female&mdash;that produce distinct behaviors. In her book <em>Brain
Storm: The Flaws in the Science of Sex Difference</em> (2010), Rebecca
Jordan-Young examines the many shortcomings of this research program
(see also Roy 2016 for critical analysis of the role of difference in
neurofeminist research). Despite the sheer volume of studies
purporting to find correlating sex differences at each of these
levels, Jordan-Young&rsquo;s careful and exhaustive analysis shows
fundamental methodological and interpretive errors. For instance, a
lack of consistency in the definition and operationalization of
central concepts, such as sex-typical desire, means that results that
initially appear to be mutually enforcing simply because they find
some correlation between an atypical female hormonal profile and
non-feminine sexual behavior (2010: 109&ndash;43) are clearly
contradictory on closer examination.</p>

<p>
Sexual minorities, especially those engaging in same-sex sexual
behavior, are of particular interest in brain organization theory
because their behaviors are assumed to be atypical for their sex, thus
some genetic or hormonal factor is assumed to be the cause. Because
intersex folks have atypical genitalia or atypical chromosomal and
hormonal profiles affecting their development (see Fausto-Sterling
2000b for a useful overview of intersex conditions), they are also of
particular interest. Catherine Clune-Taylor has shown how brain
organization theory now shapes the standard treatments of people with
intersex conditions (2019). She argues, &ldquo;contemporary intersex
management both reifies the normalcy of cisgendered life and
materially constitutes it as such&rdquo; (2019: 691).</p>

<p>
Feminists are concerned with reductionism, determinism and
essentialism, particularly in their application to the sex binary,
because they have been used to deny and suppress human diversity,
particularly sexual and gender diversity. Within our society, those
types that are deemed to truly exist are frequently placed in a value
hierarchy and their members are (at best) expected or (at worst)
coerced to perform specific social roles and behave in certain ways,
curtailing their freedom. Furthermore, treating sex and sexuality
differences as determined by simple binary genetic mechanisms that
determine simple binary hormonal mechanisms that determine brain
function and ultimately behavior is taken to imply that many
traits&mdash;from competitiveness, to sexual precocity, to color
preferences&mdash;that might reasonably be assumed to be entirely
culturally driven gender traits are biologically given sex traits.
This seems to preclude the possibility of more just and equitable
social arrangements on anything quicker than an evolutionary
timescale, and probably not even then. Of course, it is not simply the
fact that these reductionist, determinist, and essentialist
assumptions are politically noxious that inspires feminist critique.
They are also generally false. As John Dupr&eacute; notes &ldquo;The
biological determinism associated with [sex and gender essentialism]
is no longer scientifically defensible&rdquo; (2021: 57). This is why
they are also widely criticized by nonfeminist philosophers of
biology, as exemplified by David Hull&rsquo;s critique of reductionism
(1972, 1974) (see the entry on
 <a href="../reduction-biology/">reductionism in biology</a>
 for a thorough review) or Paul Griffith&rsquo;s critique of
innateness and folk essentialism (2002).</p>

<h3 id="Meta">3.2 Metaphor</h3>

<p>
There is significant feminist work on the role of gender-laden
language, and in particular of metaphor, in biology. Evelyn Fox Keller
has done significant work on &ldquo;Master Molecule&rdquo;
characterizations of DNA (1983, 1985). She has also argued that
cultural norms enter into evolutionary biology, particularly
mathematical ecology, due to a slippage between technical and
colloquial uses of the word &ldquo;competition&rdquo;, and that the
language of reproductive autonomy supports a bias towards
individualism in biology (Keller 1992b). Emily Martin (1991) and the
Biology and Gender Study Group (1988) both have shown that romantic
metaphors play a confounding role in biological descriptions of
fertilization. In some cases, supporting false assumptions of female
passivity, the egg is cast in the role of Sleeping Beauty that is
awakened by the valiant sperm, which struggled to beat out its rivals
and awaken the egg. In stories that acknowledge the activity of the
egg, it is cast in the role of femme fatale, snagging the hapless
sperm and dragging it into its clutches. Both sets of stories cohere
with female stereotypes and neither of them clearly describes the
reciprocal interactions between the egg and the sperm during
reproduction.</p>

<h2 id="FemiAnalPartAreaBiolRese">4. Feminist Analyses of Particular Areas of Biological Research</h2>

<p>
This section focuses on two areas of biological research that have
received extensive feminist analysis, sexual selection theory, and
sociobiology/evolutionary psychology. These topics are of central
importance in feminist philosophy of biology and illustrate many of
the concepts discussed above.</p>

<h3 id="SexuSele">4.1 Sexual Selection</h3>

<p>
Feminist interventions regarding evolutionary models of sexual
selection are important for at least two reasons. First, the role of
female organisms in evolution was generally neglected or
misrepresented by biologists until the late twentieth century. Second,
these models provide theoretical foundations for many biological
accounts of human nature that support sexist and androcentric
stereotypes, in particular accounts that portray women as passive and
coy, and men as active and promiscuous.</p>

<h4>4.1.1 What is sexual selection?</h4>

<p>
Evolution by natural selection happens when there are heritable
differences among types of organisms in a population and, as a result
of these differences, some types leave more offspring than others.
This leads to changes in the frequencies of those different types of
organisms in a population. Darwin described sexual selection in terms
of &ldquo;the advantage which certain individuals have over other
individuals of the same sex and species, in exclusive relation to
reproduction&rdquo; (1871: vol. 1 256).</p>

<p>
In other words, this advantage need not be one of physiological or
mechanical efficiency or longevity, but rather concerns increasing
reproductive potential. Darwin notes two kinds of sexual selection:
male-male competition and female choice. This twofold characterization
of sexual selection remains standard in current biological literature
ranging from academic publications to textbooks to the popular press.
Darwin writes that &ldquo;the male is generally eager to pair with any
female&rdquo; whereas females tend to choose the most attractive
partner (1874: 226). Darwin considered the competition among males
&ldquo;for the possession of the other sex&rdquo; to result in the
improvement of sensory and locomotory features and the development of
strong passions (1872: 69).</p>

<p>
This theme is carried through in his discussion in <em>Sexual
Selection in Relation to Man</em>, in which hunting, defense of self
and community, and competition for mates result in the development of
men&rsquo;s &ldquo;observation, reason, invention or
imagination&rdquo; (1874: 564). Women obtain these traits because they
inherit them from their fathers. Darwin writes that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is, indeed, fortunate that the law of the equal transmission of
characters to both sexes prevails with mammals; otherwise it is
probable that man would have become as superior in mental endowment to
women, as the peacock is in ornamental plumage to the peahen. (Darwin
1874: 565)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Whereas Darwin believed that male-male competition was generally
thought to improve the species, female choice resulted in the
development of beauty without utility:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a great number of male animals&hellip; have been rendered beautiful
for beauty&rsquo;s sake. (Darwin 1872: 161)</p>

<p>
the most refined beauty may serve as a charm for the female, and for
no other purpose. (Darwin 1871: vol. 2 92)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In this view, the expensive and dangerous displays of the peacock are
the result of the preference of females for males with the most
beautiful display. It is worth noting that Darwin developed his
notions of female choice to account for traits that seemed to be
maladaptive from the perspective of natural selection alone.</p>

<p>
Several feminist scholars, most especially Ruth Hubbard (1990), have
clearly pointed out the close parallels of Darwin&rsquo;s account of
eager males competing with one another for access to reticent and
choosy females with Victorian gender values (see also, Fausto-Sterling
1985 [1992]). It is also noted that the activity of choice Darwin
ascribed to females is caused by a female preoccupation with beauty
and as such often has negative consequences for both male survival and
the species itself. Nonetheless, feminists have revealed that Darwin
was exceptional for theorizing that female choice in animals had any
evolutionary consequences at all. For example, as Helena Cronin (1991)
points out, Darwin&rsquo;s contemporaries, especially Alfred Russell
Wallace,</p>

<ol>

<li>were skeptical that females (with the exception of humans, Fichman
2004: 268&ndash;9) had an aesthetic sense,</li>

<li>believed that if they did have one, it was unlikely to be stable
enough to result in evolutionary change,</li>

<li>believed that female choice, if it did exist, would be swamped out
by natural selection, and finally</li>

<li>believed that the excessive male displays were likely the result
of the excess vigor possessed by male animals and not female
choice.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Darwin&rsquo;s theories of sexual selection and especially of female
choice languished for nearly a century.</p>

<p>
Contemporary thought regarding sexual selection is heavily influenced
by the work of biologists Angus Bateman and Robert Trivers. Bateman
(1948) hypothesized that variance in reproductive success would be
greater among males than among females. Female reproduction is limited
by the number of eggs a female produces and during a single
reproductive cycle a female uses the sperm from one or a small number
of copulations. According to Bateman&rsquo;s view, once the female has
garnered the sperm needed to fertilize her eggs, she does not benefit
from further mating. As a result a female ought to be picky about who
she mates with and since, according to the theory, sperm is never in
short supply, all females are assumed to produce about the same number
of offspring. Male reproduction, on the other hand, is limited by the
number of females that a male can inseminate. A male becomes
reproductively fit by inseminating as many females as possible. This
results in competition among males for access to females, with some
males mating with many females and some males mating with few or no
females. Bateman conducted an experiment with fruit flies in which he
found higher variance in male reproductive success than female
reproductive success. (It should be noted that recently a failure to
replicate Bateman&rsquo;s findings and the identification of various
methodological problems with the study have cast doubt on these
findings [Tang-Martinez 2012].)</p>

<p>
Trivers (1972) added considerations of parental care to
Bateman&rsquo;s argument. Trivers argues that females generally invest
more than males in reproduction, not only in terms of creating large
eggs, but also in the development and care of offspring. As a result,
females ought to be even choosier regarding mates and become an even
more limited resource for males. Again, it follows that males are
motivated to mate with as many females as possible and females are
motivated to resist male advances in the hope of choosing the best
mate possible. This is correlated with and reinforces stereotypes of
males as active, promiscuous, and competitive, and females as passive,
coy, and nurturing. The rhetoric of the coy female and the promiscuous
male is decreasing but is still common among many accounts of sexual
selection.</p>

<p>
Feminist philosophers of biology are deeply concerned about the
wholesale application of this model of sexual selection without
empirically testing its underlying assumptions and investigating the
relationship between the underlying foundations of the model and
cultural assumptions regarding gender. Whether or not it is intended
to do so by researchers in the field, this model can offer support to
current gender inequities. As Hubbard (1990: 110) points out,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
from the seemingly innocent asymmetries between eggs and sperm flow
such major social consequences as female fidelity, male promiscuity,
women&rsquo;s disproportional contribution to the care of children,
and the unequal distribution of labour by sex.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This model also provides a basis for arguments that rape is an evolved
reproductive strategy among human males (Thornhill &amp; Palmer 2000).
And E. O. Wilson (1978: 103) proposes that because of arguments based
on this model even with identical education for men and women and
equal access to all professions, men are likely to maintain
disproportionate representation in political life, business, and
science.</p>

<h4>4.1.2 Feminist interventions</h4>

<p>
The traditional theoretical perspective on sexual selection described
above is an elegant model. However, it relies on several assumptions
in order to be applicable to actual cases. Hrdy (1986) has described
three broad categories of assumptions needed to successfully apply
this model to real situations. The first assumption is that <em>male
investment in the production of offspring is small relative to female
investment</em>. Ruth Hubbard (1990) points out that the challenge
here is determining the appropriate way to characterize and measure
investment. Eggs are larger than sperm. So, if one simply considers
gamete size, male investment is smaller. However, males do not use a
microscopic eyedropper to dispense one sperm at a time. Hubbard
questions whether investment ought to be measured at the level of the
individual gamete. When one includes the total amount of energy and
resources that are need to produce sperm and semen, the energy
required to develop and maintain secondary sexual characteristics
(differences between the sexes that are not directly linked to the
reproductive system), the costs of male-male competition, the costs
that males of many species invest in defending a territory, and the
effort that the males of some species put into parental care, male
costs may turn out to be higher than researchers have historically
expected. These male costs may be further increased if one measures
them over an individual&rsquo;s lifetime as opposed to a single
reproductive event. It is important for researchers to justify their
characterization of what counts as investment.</p>

<p>
The second assumption is that <em>there is greater variance in male
than female reproductive success</em>. While this is the case for many
species, it is an empirical matter whether or not this applies to
other species. In some species, variance in female reproductive
success is higher than has been assumed and in some species, variance
in male reproductive success is lower than is often assumed. Hrdy
(1981 [1999], 1986) points out that there has been a lack of attention
to ways that a female can end investment in a particular reproductive
attempt, for example, female birds abandoning nests or spontaneous
abortion among some species of mammals. Attention also needs to be
paid to the effects of a female&rsquo;s physiological condition and
social status on her reproductive output. Hrdy demonstrates that
female primates have an impressive array of active strategies that
they employ to control their own reproduction. For example,
competition and systems of social alliances among female primates can
lead to unexpected variance in female reproductive success. Hubbard
(1990) allows that theoretically there could be greater variance in
reproductive success among men than among women, but claims that
generally most societies have the same number of men and women
producing children and do not operate using a few
&ldquo;super-studs&rdquo;. Hubbard points out that it remains to be
demonstrated that weaker men, however one would measure this
characteristic, have fewer children than powerful men and that women
tend to have similar numbers of children.</p>

<p>
The final assumption is that <em>the only evolutionary benefit of sex
for females is fertilization</em>. As Sterelny and Griffiths (1999)
report, the power of the model decreases as the gap between sex and
reproduction increases. Hrdy (1986), focusing on primatology, points
out that once the notion of female promiscuity and the idea that there
can be more reasons for mating than simply gathering sperm from one
high quality male, were considered, several new hypotheses regarding
the benefits of female promiscuity emerged. Some of these hypotheses
are still linked to reproduction, although the picture is more
complicated than issues of female choice and male competition. For
example, the diverse paternity hypothesis predicts that in
unpredictable and changing environments a female&rsquo;s lifetime
reproductive success can be improved by producing offspring with
different fathers. Other hypotheses are not directly related to
reproduction. Examples include the hypothesis that multiple matings
and orgasms are physiologically beneficial to females and the
hypothesis that females have sex with subordinate males to stop these
males from leaving the social group. Hrdy writes that, &ldquo;all but one of
these hypotheses&hellip;were arrived at by considering the world from
a female&rsquo;s point of view&rdquo; (1986: 127).</p>

<p>
She points out that when this change in perspective was happening,
primarily in the 1970s, there was an increase in the proportion of
women primatologists and that these women were paying attention to
female primates. She doubts that it is just chance that led women
scientists to look at female behaviors, writing in 1986 that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
it is disconcerting to note that primatologists are beginning to find
politically motivated females and nurturing males at roughly the same
time that a woman runs for vice president of the United States and
Garry Trudeau starts to poke fun at &ldquo;caring males&rdquo; in his
cartoons. (1986: 137)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
More recent research on sexual selection has embraced a wider range of
perspectives. In particular there is a growing body of feminist
research on topics such as male mate choice, female-female
competition, and the active female role in evolutionary reproductive
conflicts between the sexes (see Hrdy 1981 [1999] and Gowaty 1992,
1997b). Joan Roughgarden offers an alternative to sexual selection,
social selection theory, that focuses on the direct ecological
benefits of social behavior, including animal mating behavior (2004,
2009). These ecological benefits refer to the ways that social
interactions can improve the number of offspring that an individual
can raise. This theory can account for the empirical evidence that has
been used to support sexual selection. It does not treat same sex
sexuality as anomalous because these social interactions can provide
ecological benefits that support reproductive success. This theory is
the subject of lively debate (e.g., Milam et al. 2011). Ornithologist
Richard Prum (2017) has recently argued for a more Darwinian approach
to sexual selection, highlighting the importance of the aesthetic and
female choice, while questioning the mainstream orthodoxy that assumes
that ornamental traits simply display good genes and emphasizing
individual freedom and beauty as evolutionary drivers. Whether his
account is successful or his critique of contemporary sexual selection
theory is entirely fair has been up for debate (see, e.g., Patricelli,
Hebets, &amp; Mendelson 2019). Certainly, sexual selection theory is
an active field of research, in which there is significant opportunity
for further feminist analyses.</p>

<h3 id="SociPsyc">4.2 Sociobiology/Evolutionary Psychology</h3>

<p>
Broadly speaking, <em>sociobiology</em>, which arises out of work in
population genetics, population ecology and ethology, is the
evolutionary study of human and non-human social behavior.
Sociobiologists postulate that some behaviors are traits, just like
height or hair color, that are subject to evolution by natural
selection. Ideally, to show that a behavior is an evolutionary
adaptation, researchers must demonstrate that (1) the behavior is
heritable, (2) there is or was behavioral variability among
individuals in a population, and (3) that differential reproduction,
caused by the presence of the behavior in question, led to an increase
in the frequency of individuals tending to exhibit that behavior in a
population. Since researchers cannot go back in time to directly
observe the evolution of current behaviors, they most often rely on
indirect evidence. Sociobiology is most often associated with E.O.
Wilson, either his more general work exemplified in his book
<em>Sociobiology a New Synthesis</em> (1975) or <em>On Human
Nature</em> (1978), which focuses on human sociobiology. There is
feminist work in sociobiology such as Sarah Hrdy&rsquo;s work on
mother-infant relations (1981 [1999], 1986).</p>

<p>
<em>Evolutionary psychology</em> is sometimes described as psychology
that is informed by evolutionary theory and sometimes described as the
latest version of sociobiology. Evolutionary psychology differs from
sociobiology in several respects. Instead of looking for adaptive
explanations for particular behaviors, evolutionary psychologists
develop adaptive hypotheses for psychological mechanisms that generate
behaviors and tend to assume a modular theory of mind. Whereas there
is incredible diversity of human behavior, many evolutionary
psychologists postulate a smaller number of mechanisms or modules that
are responsible for a range of behaviors. Much work in evolutionary
psychology relies on evolutionary theoretical foundations and
psychological empirical methods. Major themes in evolutionary
psychological research include studies of social exchange (Cosmides
1989; Cosmides &amp; Tooby 1992; Tooby &amp; Cosmides 1992), family
dynamics and conflict (including violence against stepchildren [Daly
&amp; Wilson 2005] and wives [M. Wilson &amp; Daly 1998]), and human
mate choice and sexual jealousy (Buss 1994 [2003], 2005).</p>

<p>
There are two major feminist concerns with much sociobiological and
evolutionary psychological research on sex and gender. First the
research presents a picture of human nature that exhibits
androcentric, sexist, and capitalist social values. Feminist
philosophers of biology have been motivated to carefully analyze this
research and have found significant methodological problems. For
example, Elisabeth Lloyd (2003) reveals adaptationist assumptions, as
well as failures to demonstrate heritability or the action of natural
selection in evolutionary psychological accounts of sexual
assault.</p>

<p>
A second category of feminist concern regarding much research in
sociobiology and evolutionary psychology involves problematic
assumptions of a coarse causal connection between genes and behavior.
These assumptions, coupled with the assertion that human behaviors are
the result of natural selection, makes it seem as though, as Ruth
Bleier (1984: 15) puts it, &ldquo;we had best resign ourselves to the
more unsavory aspects of human behavior&rdquo;. The worry is that
these studies of the evolution of human behavior cast behaviors such
as violence against women, wives, and children, and the sexual
division of labor as biologically determined, hence making attempts at
social change seem futile.</p>

<p>
For example, sociobiologist, David Barash writes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
There is good reason to believe that we are (genetically) primed to be
much less sexually egalitarian than we appear to be (1979: 47)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
and</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Because men maximize their fitness differently from women, it is
perfectly good biology that business and professions taste sweeter to
them, while home and child care taste sweeter to women. (1979:
114)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When it comes to sex, sociobiologist E.O. Wilson writes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It pays for males to be aggressive, hasty, fickle and
undiscriminating. In theory it is more profitable for females to be
coy, to hold back until they can identify males with the best
genes&hellip; Human beings obey this biological principle faithfully.
(1978: 125)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Feminist and non-feminist philosophers of biology have identified a
range of problems common among much research in sociobiology and
evolutionary psychology. (The list below is primarily drawn from
Bleier 1984; see also Fausto-Sterling 1997, 2000a; Fausto-Sterling et
al. 1997; Buller 2005; Kitcher 1985; and Sterelny &amp; Griffiths 1999
offer good overviews and introductions to the non-feminist
literature.) These problems include kinds of bias as well as
methodological challenges.</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>
<em>Androcentrism.</em> Historically female primates were studied only
in their interactions with males or with infants. Women primatologists
(see Haraway 1989) and sociobiologists (Hrdy 1986) who carefully
observed females, as well as other members of primate groups,
discovered new information that overthrew previously held beliefs
regarding dominance hierarchies, mate selection, and female-female
competition by focusing on female-female interactions.</p> </li>

<li>

<p>
<em>Ethnocentrism</em>. Much research on human behavior focuses on
identifying and explaining behavioral traits that are universal among
humans and have a cross-cultural meaning. For example, Buss argues
that love is cross-cultural (1994 [2003]) and Margo Wilson and Martin
Daly that marriage is cross-cultural (1992). However, human beings
live in a wide variety of cultural and environmental contexts. John
Dupr&eacute; writes</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Anthropologists describe systems of marriage that are monogamous,
polygamous, occasionally polyandrous, hypergamous or hypogamous (women
marrying up or down although equal status is said to be the commonest
case), between people of the same sex, and is some cases as not
involving sexual relations at all. (2001: 59)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This makes it difficult to imagine what the cross-cultural universal
could be. It also makes it very easy to make false assumptions about
the nature of such a phenomenon based on a particular cultural
perspective.</p> </li>

<li>

<p>
<em>Anthropocentrism</em>. There is room for unrecognized or implicit
social values to enter into research when researchers make comparisons
among species. It is easy to create circular arguments when
researchers use loaded terms, defined in the context of particular
human language and culture, to describe animal behavior and then use
those descriptions to argue that human behaviors are innate because
they are found in animals. For example, it is common to refer to
&ldquo;harems&rdquo; and &ldquo;prostitution&rdquo; when describing
the behavior of non-human primates. There is an extensive literature
on the evolution of rape, with rape being &ldquo;observed&rdquo; in
flowers, scorpion flies, some species of fish and ducks, and then
these observations are used to draw conclusions about the biological
nature of rape in humans. An obvious problem is that rape in humans is
defined as sex in the absence of consent or that is against the
victim&rsquo;s will. The same notion of consent or will in flowers,
flies, fish, and ducks is absent.</p> </li>

<li>

<p>
<em>Lack of attention to limitations inherent in studying humans.</em>
Human behavior is a fraught area of study. On one hand it is seductive
because there is a deep interest in trying to understand why we behave
as we do. One the other hand, if researchers are trying to understand
social behavior in general, there is little to recommend human beings
as experimental subjects. First, it is unethical to perform the
necessary controlled experiments on humans. Furthermore, such
experiments are impractical because we live too long for researchers
to conveniently follow the development and evolutionary consequences
of particular behavioral traits and tendencies. In addition, a common
evolutionary investigative technique is to compare traits among
closely related species. However as Sterelny and Griffiths (1999)
point out, human beings are evolutionary orphans. Even though there
are several species of non-human primates that are extensively
studied, they are simply not as numerous, nor do they form as closely
a related group of species with humans, as can be found in, for
example, groups of social ant or bee species. Finally, human behavior
is complicated by intentionality, language and culture, which make
comparisons between human and non-human animals challenging. For
example, refer back Martin&rsquo;s (2003) critique of evolutionary
explanations of rape. The notion of consent means something very
different in a human as opposed to an animal context. As a result of
limitations inherent to studying the evolution of human behavior, it
is more challenging to draw conclusions about human behavior than
about the behavior of many other groups of animals, and conclusions
about human beings might need to be more tentative than conclusions
about other organisms.</p> </li>

<li>

<p>
<em>Lack of attention to changing environments.</em> There is a lack
of good information about the environment, including the social
environment, in which humans evolved. We know that there are
differences among the environments in which people currently live and
between current environments and early human environments. Postulating
evolutionary adaptations only makes sense in reference to a particular
environment because adaptations are responses to particular
environmental challenges. A behavior may be an adaptation to a past
environment and not benefit individuals in a current environment.
Alternatively, a behavior may benefit an individual without being the
result of natural selection for that benefit. As a result, conclusions
drawn about the evolution of human behavior need to be tentative.</p>
</li>

<li>

<p>
<em>Adaptationism (Failure to adequately consider causes of evolution
other than natural selection).</em> Causes of evolution other than
natural selection must be tested. For example, even if there are
behaviors that are correlated with specific genes it does not follow
that the behavior is the result of natural selection and hence is an
adaptation. Genes commonly have multiple effects and it is possible
for natural selection to select for only one of those effects. In this
case the other effect will increase in frequency in the population
even though it is not selected for. A similar case can occur when two
genes are linked on the same chromosome. In this way a behavior may be
very common not because it confers an evolutionary advantage, but
because it is associated with a different beneficial trait. Other
causes of evolution include random drift, mutation, and immigration of
individuals between populations. Recall that Elisabeth Lloyd
identified adaptationism as a problem with Thornhill and
Palmer&rsquo;s arguments about the evolution of rape (2003) and most
accounts of the evolution of the female orgasm (2005).</p> </li>

<li>

<p>
<em>Lack of clear definitions of behavior.</em> Behavioral traits need
to be clearly defined. For example, it is postulated that males are
naturally more aggressive than females. What counts as aggression is
unclear. Is it going to war, or punching another individual, or having
very active adrenal function? The appropriate grain of analysis is not
clear. If one lives in a culture in which males are considered more
aggressive than females, then one may notice the higher proportion of
men rather than women who commit violent crimes and not notice cases
of females fighting to defend their offspring or competing with each
other for resources. The issue of defining traits is not only a matter
of clarity. Ontology is at stake because for evolutionary hypotheses
to explain what exists in the world, our definitions must divide up
the world into traits that are passed from generation to generation
and on which natural selection can act.</p> </li>

<li>

<p>
<em>Problematic choice of comparison species</em>. The data one can
gather and the conclusions one can draw about human behavioral
evolution from non-human primates are highly dependent on the primate
species to which one attends. For example, in mid-twentieth century
primatology researchers chose species for study, such as savanna
baboons, which had social structures that seemed similar to humans. In
the 1970s feminist primatologists were instrumental in convincing the
scientific community that chimpanzees were a more appropriate species
for modeling key transitions in human evolution. This switch in model
organism was supported by molecular phylogenetic, comparative
anatomical, and paleontological data, but it was also a strategic
feminist move, as chimpanzees are matrifocal creatures with complex
social lives. This facilitated a research focus on mothering, which
was consistent with the focus on maternal thinking and social
motherhood in that period of western feminism (Haraway 1989). There
are at least two kinds of recommendations that arise here. First, if
one is focusing on removing bias, then one should take care not to
falsely generalize across the diversity that can be found among
primate species (Hrdy 1986). Second, one needs to take responsibility
for one&rsquo;s choice of model organism, because it will have an
impact on the kinds of knowledge that one can produce (Haraway
1989).</p> </li>
</ul>

<p>
Evolutionary research regarding human behavior is especially difficult
to do well. It is very easy to take an aspect of human social behavior
that seems universal to a particular group of researchers, for example
male aggression, and create a compelling but unsupported story about
why that behavior enhances the survival and reproduction of
individuals exhibiting it and hence &ldquo;explains&rdquo; why it is
currently &ldquo;universal&rdquo;. In particular, there is little
analysis of just what it is that makes these stories seem compelling
or even plausible. It is important to note that these just-so stories
predominantly support the social status quo and traditional Western,
capitalist, patriarchal &ldquo;virtues&rdquo; ranging from a tendency
to be entrepreneurial and the inevitability of hierarchical social
arrangements, to the naturalness of male promiscuity and violence
against women. Although some feminists are very pessimistic about the
possibility of conducting non-sexist research on the evolution of
human behavior, there is not a general view within feminist philosophy
of biology that all sociobiological research is problematic. In fact,
some feminist critics and scientists use non-sexist sociobiological
research on non-human animals (for example the work of Sarah Hrdy) to
critique problematic evolutionary accounts of gendered behavior.</p>

<p>
Sexual selection and evolutionary accounts of behavior that relate to
sex and gender are examples of two areas of science that have been
treated to extensive analysis by feminist philosophers of biology.</p>

<h2 id="Conc">5. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
There are at least three areas in which feminist philosophy of biology
can be fruitfully developed. First, many topics are addressed by both
feminist and non-feminist philosophers of biology, but there is often
a paucity of interactions between these two bodies of literature. For
example, reductionism is an important topic in both fields, and in
both fields there is generally an anti-reductionist consensus, yet
they rarely cite each others&rsquo; work (for exceptions see
Dupr&eacute; 1993, 2001 and Fehr 2004, 2012) and typically speak to
one audience or the other, rather than addressing both. There is a
wide range of anti-reductionist arguments on which feminists could
draw and non-feminists can be aided by careful considerations of the
social and political impact of reductionism. More interaction between
feminist and non-feminist philosophers of biology could be mutually
beneficial.</p>

<p>
Second, there is room for further integrating feminist philosophy of
biology with feminist epistemology and philosophy of science. Feminist
philosophy of biology includes a vast body of literature documenting
the impact of sexism and androcentrism in both the practice of biology
and the knowledge produced by biologists. There are significant
opportunities to further develop this work in light of advances in
feminist and social epistemology (such as epistemologies of ignorance
and epistemic injustice). Furthermore, current interest by historians
in documenting the contributions of early feminist scholars would
surely find a variety of fascinating stories and lessons through
examining the lives and works of feminist biologists and philosophers
of biology working in the 1970s to 1990s, particularly in relation to
the science wars.</p>

<p>
Third, there are opportunities to develop feminist analyses on a wide
range of topics in the biological sciences. Some of these topics are
perennial, such as research into sexual selection and sociobiology and
evolutionary psychology, discussed above. Others are more of the
moment. For instance, current interest in animal studies suggests that
now may be a particularly productive time for feminist philosophers of
biology, who are ever alert to the distorting effects of power
structures and situatedness, to engage these conversations. A similar
point might be made about the Gaia hypothesis (and perhaps ecology
more generally), especially in light of catastrophic climate change
and the imminent ecological collapse that it promises. Also, there are
opportunities to develop feminist analyses of scientific research
programs that are relatively new such as genomics, proteomics and
other &ldquo;omics&rdquo; research programs as they relate to gender
(see Keller 2000; S. Richardson 2013). Similarly, the scientifically
rigorous and politically astute approaches of feminist philosophers of
biology are clearly needed as &ldquo;sex-based biology&rdquo; comes to
inform new trends in the medical sciences, such as precision medicine
(DiMarco, Zhao, Boulicault &amp; Richardson 2022). The use of AI in
biological research and research bridging biology and fields such as
computer science, engineering, and physics cries out for
intersectional feminist analysis as in all of these areas of
investigation there is room to ask questions about the role of
interests and power in the construction and use of knowledge as well
as other epistemic questions rooted in recent work in feminist
epistemology and feminist philosophy of science.</p>

<p>
There are many ways to chart the boundaries of feminist philosophy of
biology. While feminist philosophy of biology continues to advance by
engaging new areas of biological research and developing new research
approaches several themes (such as explanatory pluralism, the
rejection of reductionist, determinist and essentialist explanations,
and an appreciation of the complex ways that values enter the
sciences) remain central to the field. It is striking that nonfeminist
philosophy of biology has increasingly come to agree with these
positions long held by feminists.</p>

<h1>Location and Mereology</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Jun 7, 2013; substantive revision Mon Mar 18, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Substantivalists believe that there are <em>regions</em> of space or
spacetime. Many substantivalists also believe that there are entities
(people, tables, social groups, electrons, fields, holes, events,
tropes, universals, &hellip;) that are <em>located at</em> regions.
These philosophers face questions about the relationship between
entities and the regions they are located at. Are located entities
identical to their locations? Are they entirely separate from their
locations, i.e., they share no parts with them?</p>

<p>
Without prejudging these metaphysical questions, some philosophers
have formulated <em>logics</em> of location&mdash;typically groups of
axioms governing a location relation and its interaction with
mereological notions. These logics aim to capture the ways in which
the mereological properties of and relations between located entities
must mirror the mereological properties of and relations between the
locations of those entities.</p>

<p>
The recent literature focuses on four questions, each corresponding to
a way in which the relevant mirroring might fail:</p>

<ul>

<li>Say that two entities <strong>interpenetrate</strong> just in case
they do not share parts but their exact locations do. Is
interpenetration possible?</li>

<li>Say that an <strong>extended simple</strong> is an entity that has
no proper parts but is exactly located at a region that has proper
parts. Are extended simples possible?</li>

<li>Conversely, say that an <strong>unextended complex</strong> is an
entity that has proper parts but is exactly located at a region that
does not have proper parts. Are unextended complexes possible?</li>

<li>Say that an entity is <strong>multilocated</strong> just in case
it is exactly located at more than one region. Is multilocation
possible?</li>
</ul>

<p>
The present article surveys recent work on these questions and
addresses other issues along the way. The goal of the entry is not to
provide a general account of the metaphysics of location. Rather it
focuses on the issues that are concerned with location and its
interaction with parthood (in the spirit of, e.g., the papers
collected in Kleinschmidt (2014)).</p>

<h2 id="PrelSpacPart">1. Preliminaries: Spacetime and Parthood</h2>

<p>
This article focuses on the recent literature on location and
mereology. On the history of these topics, see Marmodoro (2017), Harte
(2002), Sorabji (1983, 1988), Pasnau (2011), and Holden (2004), as
well as the entries
 <a href="../atomism-ancient/">ancient atomism</a>,
 <a href="../mereology-medieval/">medieval mereology</a>,
 <a href="../atomism-modern/">atomism from the 17th to the 20th century</a>,
 and
 <a href="../mereology/">mereology</a>.</p>
 
<p>
In keeping with the recent literature, we will focus on
&lsquo;entity-to-region&rsquo; location relations&mdash;i.e., those
that paradigmatically hold between entities and <em>regions</em>. We
will ignore location relations that hold between entities and
non-regions.</p>

<p>
Since our focus is on entity-to-region location relations, we will
work under the following controversial but popular assumptions. There
are spacetime regions that comprise a fundamental four-dimensional
arena, spacetime. All spacetime regions are equally real and there is
no region which is absolutely present in any non-indexical sense. We
do not assume that there are points; we leave open the hypothesis that
spacetime is gunky. However, we do assume that if there are points,
then points count as regions&mdash;specifically, they would be simple
regions.</p>

<p>
Throughout the entry we take parthood as primitive and take for
granted several standard mereological definitions. We use <em>P</em>
for parthood, <em>PP</em> for Proper Parthood, and <em>O</em> for
Overlap&mdash;see the entry
 <a href="../mereology/">mereology</a>,
 and Cotnoir and Varzi (2021).</p>

<p>
We address questions framed in modal terms. Are extended simples
possible? Is it necessary that nothing is multilocated? The relevant
modality is metaphysical. In keeping with current orthodoxy, we assume
that being metaphysically necessary (a property of propositions or
sentences) is not to be identified with being a logical truth, being
an analytic truth, being a conceptual truth, or being an <em>a
priori</em> truth&mdash;see the entry
 <a href="../modality-varieties/">varieties of modality</a>.
 Although metaphysical necessity is not identified with conceptual
truth&mdash;and, correlatively, metaphysical possibility is not
identified with conceivability&mdash;one might still think that
conceivability (or something in that vicinity) is evidence for
metaphysical possibility&mdash;see the entry on
 <a href="../modality-epistemology/">the epistemology of modality</a>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
One last preliminary. The recent literature on location and mereology
tends to bracket considerations of vagueness and indeterminacy (though
see Eagle 2016a, Leonard 2022) and quantum theory (though see Pashby
2016, Calosi 2022a). We will do the same.</p>

<h2 id="Loca">2. Location</h2>

<h3 id="WhicLocaRelaFund">2.1 Which Location Relation is Fundamental?</h3>

<p>
We begin by distinguishing four location relations. Often it is
assumed that one of these is fundamental and involved in the
definitions of the others&mdash;more on that shortly. For now, we give
informal glosses of the four relations.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Exact location</strong>: \(x\) is exactly located at
region \(y\) if and only if \(x\) has (or has-at\(-y)\) exactly the
same shape and size as \(y\) and stands (or stands-at\(-y)\) in all
the same spatial or spatiotemporal relations to other entities as does
 \(y\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 (See Casati &amp; Varzi 1999: 119&ndash;120; Bittner, Donnelly, &amp;
Smith 2004; Gilmore 2006: 200&ndash;202; Sattig 2006: 48). In symbols:
\(L(x, y)\)</li>

<li><strong>Weak location:</strong> \(x\) is weakly located at region
\(y\) if and only if \(y\) is &lsquo;not completely free of&rsquo;
\(x\) (Parsons 2007: 203). \(\WKL(x, y)\)</li>

<li><strong>Entire location</strong>: \(x\) is entirely located at
region \(y\) if and only if \(x\) &lsquo;lies within&rsquo; \(y\)
(Parsons 2007: 203; Correia 2022: 560). \(\EL(x, y)\)</li>

<li><strong>Pervasive location</strong>: \(x\) is pervasively located
at region \(y\) if and only if \(y\) is no larger than \(x\) and \(x\)
&lsquo;completely fills&rsquo; \(y\) (Parsons 2008: 429; Correia 2022:
560). \(\PL(x, y)\)</li>
</ul>

<p>

 <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>
 illustrates cases of these four relations.</p>

<p>
Intuitively, \(o_1\) is exactly located at one and only one region,
\(r_1\), which has the same size and shape, and stands in the same
spatial relations to other things, as \(o_1\). However, \(o_1\) is
entirely located at each region that it lies within, such as \(r_1,
r_3\), and \(r_6\). It is pervasively located at each region that it
completely fills, such as \(r_1\) and \(r_5\). It is weakly located at
each region that is not completely free from it, such as \(r_1, r_3,
r_5, r_6\), as well as \(r_4\), at which it is neither entirely nor
pervasively located. Region \(r_2\), however, is completely free from
\(o_1\), so \(o_1\) is not even weakly located at \(r_2\). Likewise,
\(o_2\) is not even weakly located at \(r_1\). This should be enough
for a pre-theoretic grasp of our four target relations.</p>

<p>
Typically, one of the relations above is taken to be fundamental and
used to define the others. This gives rise to a wide range of possible
theories, each with its own set of definitions and axioms. Some of
these theories differ in what patterns of location they permit. For
example, if one assumes that exact location is fundamental, then one
is free to accept the possibility of a strongly multilocated thing, a
thing that is exactly located at two non-overlapping regions. On the
other hand, Parsons (2007) presents two theories, one that takes exact
location as fundamental and one that takes weak location as
fundamental. In the latter exact location is defined as follows:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag4em">
<dt id="DS2a1">(DS2a.1)</dt>
<dd class="nonitalic">\(x\) is exactly located at \(y\) \(=_{\df}\)
\(x\) is weakly located at all and only those entities that overlap
\(y\) 
\[L(x, y) =_{\df} \forall z[\WKL(x, z) \leftrightarrow O(y, z)]\]
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
According to this definition, it is analytic, hence impossible, that
nothing is strongly multilocated. To save space, we will assume
henceforth that exact location is the unique fundamental locative
relation, and that the other three relations are defined, as
follows:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag4em">
<dt id="DS11">(DS1.1)</dt>
<dd class="nonitalic">\(x\) is weakly located at \(y\) \(=_{\df}\)
\(x\) is exactly located at something that overlaps \(y\).

\[\WKL(x, y) =_{\df} \exists z[L(x, z) \amp O(z, y)]\]
</dd>
</dl>

<dl class="sentag tag4em">
<dt id="DS212">(DS1.2)</dt>
<dd class="nonitalic">\(x\) is entirely located at \(y\) \(=_{\df}\)
\(x\) is exactly located at some part of \(y\). 
\[\EL(x, y) =_{\df}\exists z[L(x, z) \amp P(z, y)]\]
</dd>
</dl>

<dl class="sentag tag4em">

<h3 id="PureLogiLoca">2.2 The Pure Logic of Location</h3>

<p>
Most of the formal work on location has focused on how location
interacts with parthood. But one might wonder about the logic of
location itself. We raise two groups of questions about this
logic.</p>

<h4 id="LogiForm">2.2.1 Logical Form</h4>

<p>
We take exact location as our unique locative primitive. We assume
that</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li id="assum1">it is a two-place relation, and</li>

<li id="assum2">both argument places in that relation are
singular.</li>
</ol>

<p>
But both (i) and (ii) have been questioned.</p>

<p>
For example, one might reject
 <a href="#assum1">(i)</a>
 in favor of the view that exact location is a three-place relation
that holds between a located entity, a region of space, and an instant
of time (Thomson 1983; Costa 2017). This is a natural view for those
who think of space as a three-dimensional entity that endures through,
and is separate from, time. (This picture is discussed in Skow 2015
and Gilmore, Costa, &amp; Calosi 2016.) To allow for the possibility
of motion, those who endorse such a view will want to be able to say,
of a given object, that it is exactly located at region \(r_1\), not
at region \(r_2\), at time \(t_1\), and that the same object is
exactly located at \(r_2\), not at \(r_1\), at time \(t_2\). To allow
for the possibility that time is gunky and does not contain instants,
one might take exact location to be expressed by &lsquo;\(x\) is
exactly located at region \(r\) within interval \(s\)&rsquo;. A
different option is to reject
 <a href="#assum2">(i)</a>
 in favor of the view that exact location is variably polyadic, an
idea floated by Jones (2018: note 29). The thought here is that one
and the same relation is expressed both by the two-place predicate
&lsquo;(&hellip;) is located at (&hellip;)&rsquo; and by (e.g.,) the
three-place predicate &lsquo;(&hellip;) is located at (&hellip;) at
time (&hellip;)&rsquo;. The relation is neither two-place simpliciter
nor three-place simpliciter but two-place as it occurs in some
propositions and three-place as it occurs in others.</p>

<p>
Alternatively, one might agree that exact location is a two-place
relation but reject
 <a href="#assum2">(ii)</a>
 above in favor of the view that, say, the second argument place in
exact location (the &lsquo;location&rsquo; slot) is plural. One idea
is that an extended object can be exactly located at many points,
collectively, without being exactly located at any one of them
individually or at the set or fusion of them. This is suggested by
Hudson (2005: 17); motivations are developed in Gilmore (2014b: 25). A
different idea is to take the first argument place (the
&lsquo;occupant&rsquo; slot) to be plural, and to speak in some cases
of some things collectively being exactly located at a given region.
For approaches like this, but applied to a primitive relation of
pervasive location, see Loss (2023) and the supplementary document
 <a href="systems-of-location.html">Systems of Location</a>.</p>
 
<h4 id="PureLocaPrin">2.2.2 Purely Locational Principles</h4>

<p>
If we assume that exact location is the one fundamental locational
relation, that it&rsquo;s two-place, and that both of its argument
places are singular, what should we say about its behavior? Here we
confine our attention to purely locational principles, that is,
principles that can be stated in a first-order language with identity
whose only non-logical predicate is &lsquo;\(L\)&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Casati and Varzi (1999: 121) propose two principles:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Functionality:</strong> Nothing has more than one exact
location. 
\[\forall x\forall y\forall z[(L(x, y) \amp L(x, z)) \rightarrow y = z]\]
</li>

<li><strong>Conditional Reflexivity:</strong> Exact locations are
exactly located at themselves. 
\[\forall x\forall y[L(x, y) \rightarrow L(y, y)]\]
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Functionality bans multilocation, which we discuss in
 <a href="#Mult">Section 6</a>.
 It tells us that nothing is exactly located at more than one region,
or indeed, at more than one entity.</p>

<p>
Conditional Reflexivity is a principle about the location of regions.
It boils down&mdash;roughly&mdash;to the claim that regions are
located at themselves. There seems to be another option for the
location of regions, namely that they do <em>not have</em> any
locations, insofar as they <em>are</em> locations. Varzi (2007: 1016)
calls this principle Conditional Emptiness:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Conditional Emptiness:</strong> If \(x\) is exactly
located at \(y\), \(y\) does not have an exact location

\[\forall x\forall y\forall z [L (x, y) \rightarrow L (y, z)]\]
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Simons (2004b: 345) endorses Conditional Emptiness, whereas Parsons
(2007: 224) and Varzi (2007: 1016) both claim that the choice between
the two is somewhat conventional. However, as we show below,
Conditional Reflexivity and Conditional Emptiness might be
incompatible with different locative principles.</p>

<p>
According to Conditional Reflexivity, exact locations are exactly
located at themselves. (See also Donnelly (2004: 158), who presents a
system in which Conditional Reflexivity is a theorem, though she
replaces the location predicate &lsquo;\(L\)&rsquo; with a primitive
function symbol &lsquo;\(r\)&rsquo; for &lsquo;the exact location
of&rsquo;.) Suppose that Obama is exactly located at region \(r\).
Together with Conditional Reflexivity, this entails that \(r\) is
exactly located at itself. This conflicts with a purely locational
principle endorsed by Simons (2004b: 345):</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Asymmetry of Location:</strong> <span class="nonitalic">If
\(x\) is exactly located at \(y\) then \(y\) is not exactly located at
\(x\).</span> 
\[\forall x\forall y[(L(x, y) \rightarrow \neg L(y, x)]\]
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Note, however, that cases in which a region is exactly located at
itself do not conflict with</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Antisymmetry of Location:</strong> <span class="nonitalic">No
two entities are exactly located at each
other.</span> 
\[\forall x\forall y[(L(x, y) \amp L(y, x)) \rightarrow x = y]\]
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Antisymmetry of Location may salvage some of the motivation for
Asymmetry of Location while still harmonizing with Conditional
Reflexivity. Antisymmetry of Location is a logical consequence of
Functionality and Conditional Reflexivity (as is the view that exact
location is transitive).</p>

<p>
If we further assume that Obama is not identical to his exact location
\(r\), we get the result that there are two different entities exactly
located at \(r\)&mdash;namely, \(r\) and Obama. In that case, we have
a counterexample to another purely locational principle that some have
found attractive:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Injectivity of Location:</strong> <span class="nonitalic">No
two entities share an exact location.</span>

\[\forall x\forall y\forall z[(L(x, z) \amp L(y, z)) \rightarrow x = y]\]
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Opponents of co-location may take this as a <em>reductio</em> of
Conditional Reflexivity. Others may take it as a reason to reject
Injectivity of Location in favor of a weaker variant, e.g.:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Conditional Injectivity of Location:</strong> <span class="nonitalic" style="text-indent:0pt">If
neither \(x\) nor \(y\)
is identical to \(z\), then if each of them is exactly located at
\(z\), then \(x\) and \(y\) are identical to each other.</span>

\[\forall x\forall y\forall z[(\neg x = z \amp \neg y = z) \rightarrow ((L(x, z) \amp L(y, z)) \rightarrow x = y)]\]
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Conditional Injectivity is equivalent to the claim that whenever two
different entities share a given exact location, one of them is
identical to that location. This may salvage some of the motivation
for the ban on co-location, while still harmonizing with Conditional
Reflexivity.</p>

<p>
In the presence of Conditional Reflexivity the &lsquo;region
predicate&rsquo; can be defined as:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Regionhood:</strong> \(R(x) =_{\df} L(x, x)\)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
That is, regions are the entities located at themselves. In turn this
helps formulating restricted mereological principles such as
&ldquo;any plurality of regions has a fusion&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="IntePart">3. Interaction with Parthood</h2>

<p>
Philosophers have put forward various axiom systems to capture the
interaction between parthood and location. One idea is that the
mereological properties of, and relations between, located entities
<em>perfectly match</em> those of their locations. This has been
dubbed <em>Mereological Harmony</em> (Schaffer 2009a; Uzquiano 2011;
Leonard 2016), and <em>Mirroring</em> in Varzi (2007).</p>

<p>
Mereological Harmony has been captured formally in different ways by
Varzi (2007), Uzquiano (2011), and Leonard (2016). Saucedo (2011:
227&ndash;228) offers the following principles:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="H1">(H1)</dt>
<dd>\(x\) is mereologically simple iff \(x\)&rsquo;s location is
mereologically simple.</dd>
<dt id="H2">(H2)</dt>
<dd>\(x\) is mereologically complex iff \(x\)&rsquo;s location is
mereologically complex.</dd>
<dt id="H3">(H3)</dt>
<dd>\(x\) has exactly \(n\) parts iff \(x\)&rsquo;s location has
exactly \(n\) parts.</dd>
<dt id="H4">(H4)</dt>
<dd>\(x\) is gunky iff \(x\)&rsquo;s location is gunky.</dd>
<dt id="H5">(H5)</dt>
<dd>\(x\) is a part of \(y\) iff \(x\)&rsquo;s location is a subregion
of \(y\)&rsquo;s location.</dd>

<!--pdf include </dl>

<dl class="sentag tag3em avoid-break"> pdf include-->
<dt id="H6">(H6)</dt>
<dd>\(x\) is a proper part of \(y\) iff \(x\)&rsquo;s location is a
proper part of \(y\)&rsquo;s location.</dd>
<dt id="H7">(H7)</dt>
<dd>\(x\) and \(y\) overlap iff \(x\)&rsquo;s location and
\(y\)&rsquo;s location overlap.</dd>
<dt id="H8">(H8)</dt>
<dd>The \(x\)s compose \(y\) iff the locations of the \(x\)s compose
\(y\)&rsquo;s location.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Some philosophers take Mereological Harmony to be a necessary truth
(Schaffer 2009a:
 138).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 The remainder of this entry considers three separate threats to the
view that Mereological Harmony is necessary: interpenetration
 (<a href="#Inte">Section 4</a>),
 extended simples and unextended complexes
 (<a href="#ExteSimpUnexComp">Section 5</a>),
 and multilocation
 (<a href="#Mult">Section 6</a>).</p>
 
<p>
There are other threats to Mereological Harmony that we will not
discuss, e.g., threats to
 <a href="#H7">(H7)</a>
 and
 <a href="#H8">(H8)</a>
 that arise from &lsquo;moderate views about receptacles&rsquo;,
according to which only topologically open (alternatively: only
topologically closed) regions can be exact locations (see Cartwright
1975; Hudson 2005: 47&ndash;56; and especially Uzquiano 2006), or
threats to
 <a href="#H4">(H4)</a>
 discussed in Uzquiano (2011).)</p>

<p>
A case of interpenetration occurs when non-overlapping entities have
overlapping exact locations&mdash;e.g., when a ghost passes through a
wall. In such a case, the right-to-left direction of
 <a href="#H7">(H7)</a>
 fails. Similar cases involve violations of the right-to-left
directions of
 <a href="#H5">(H5)</a>
 and
 <a href="#H6">(H6)</a>.
 An extended simple is a simple entity with a complex exact location:
it violates the left-to-right direction of
 <a href="#H1">(H1)</a>,
 the right-to-left direction of the (equivalent)
 <a href="#H2">H2</a>,
 and the left-to-right direction of the instance of
 <a href="#H3">(H3)</a>
 that results from letting \(n = 1\). An unextended complex violates
 <a href="#H1">(H1)</a>
 and
 <a href="#H2">(H2)</a>
 and, depending upon cases,
 <a href="#H5">(H5)</a>&mdash;see
 <a href="#ForUnexComp">Section 5.5</a>. A case of multilocation occurs when a given entity has
more than one exact location. This violates Functionality, which is
left implicit in Saucedo&rsquo;s statement of Mereological
Harmony.</p>

<p>
The four questions that we consider&mdash;Is interpenetration
possible? Are extended simples possible? Are unextended complexes
possible? Is multilocation possible?&mdash;are logically independent
of one another. Thus, there is room for 32 specific packages of
views.</p>

<p>
Even if interpenetration, extended simples, unextended complexes, and
multilocation are all possible, some substantive principles linking
parthood and location may still survive. For example, the possibility
of interpenetration and extended simples poses no threat to:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Expansivity:</strong> Necessarily, if \(x\) is a part of
\(y\), and if \(x\) is exactly located at \(z\) and \(y\) is exactly
located at \(w\), then \(z\) is a part of \(w\): &ldquo;the
part&rsquo;s location is a part of the whole&rsquo;s
 location&rdquo;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 
\[\Box \forall x\forall y\forall z\forall w[[P(x, y) \amp L(x, z) \amp L(y, w)] \rightarrow P(z, w)]\]
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Delegation: </strong> Necessarily, if \(x\) is complex and
is exactly located at \(y\), then for any part \(z\) of \(y\), some
proper part \(w\) of \(x\) is exactly located at some region that
overlaps
 \(z\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
\[\begin{align}
\Box\forall z\forall x\forall y &amp;\left[ \left[ C(x) \amp L(x,y) \amp P(z,y)\right] \right. \\

</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Roughly, Expansivity says that an object must extend out at least as
far as its parts: it must go where its parts go; and Delegation says
that if an object is complex, then it must not extend out farther than
its proper parts: it must not go anywhere that its proper parts do not
go. Expansivity rules out cases like the following
 (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>),
 in which the object \(a\) is a part of the object \(o\), but <span class="nobr">\(a\)&rsquo;s</span>
exact location, \(r_a\), is
<em>not</em> a part of \(o\)&rsquo;s exact location, \(r\).</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break" id="fig3">
<img alt="a 2 by 3 box diagram: link to extended description below" src="figure03.svg" style="width:350px" />

<p id="fig3caption">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 3:</span> The object \(a\) is part of
the object \(o\), but \(a\)&rsquo;s exact location \(r_a\) is not a

Expansitivity</em>. [An
 <a href="figdesc.html#fig3">extended description of figure 3</a>
 is in the supplement.]</p>
</div>

<p>
The idea behind Delegation, in slightly different terms, is that a
complex entity cannot be weakly located at a certain region unless one
of its proper parts&mdash;a &lsquo;delegate&rsquo;&mdash;is also
weakly located there. Regarding the formal statement of Delegation,
one might wonder why it is not formulated with &lsquo;\(\PP(u,
z)\)&rsquo; in place of &lsquo;\(O(u, z)\)&rsquo; in the consequent.
The reason for this is that Delegation is meant to be friendly to
extended simples. Suppose that a complex, spherical object, \(c\), is
exactly located a spherical region, \(r\). Suppose that \(c\) is
composed of two hemispherical simples, \(h\) and \(h*\), and that
\(r\) is composed of continuum-many simple points, each plurality of
which composes a region that is a part of \(r\). Then, contrary to the
proposed revision, it will not be true that for every part \(y\) of
\(r\), some proper part of \(c\) is exactly located at a region that
has \(y\) as a proper part. Consider, for example, the spherical
region \(r*\) with the same center point as, but half the volume as,
\(r\) itself. \(c\) does not have a proper part that is exactly
located at \(r*\), nor does it have a proper part whose exact location
has \(r*\) as a proper part. But, as Delegation requires, \(c\) does
have a proper part \((h\), for example) that has an exact location
that overlaps \(r*\).</p>

<p>
Delegation rules out cases like the following
 (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>),
 in which \(o^*\) is a complex object that is exactly located at
region \(r^*\), but \(r^*\) has a part \(r_a\) that does not overlap
an exact location of any of \(o^*\)&rsquo;s proper parts:</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break" id="fig4">
<img alt="a 2 by 3 box diagram minus box a: link to extended description below" src="figure04.svg" style="width:350px" />

<p id="fig4caption">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 4:</span> The region \(r_a\) is a part
of object \(o^*\)&rsquo;s exact location, and object \(o^*\) is
complex, but no proper part of \(o\) has an exact location that
overlaps \(r_a\). <em>Ruled out by Delegation</em>. [An
 <a href="figdesc.html#fig4">extended description of figure 4</a>
 is in the supplement.]</p>
</div>

<p>
Neither interpenetration nor extended simples threaten Expansivity or
Delegation. One threat to Delegation comes from Pickup (2016: 260),
who considers the possibility of a complex entity that is exactly
located somewhere despite the fact that none of its proper parts is
exactly (or weakly) located anywhere. One route to such entities (not
Pickup&rsquo;s) runs as follows:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>some material objects (electrons, maybe) do not have any other
material objects as proper parts,</li>

<li>any such material object is a complex entity whose only proper
parts are universals,</li>

<li>all material objects have locations, but</li>

<li>no universals have locations.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Bundle theorists who are platonic realists about universals, and who
take the constituents of a given bundle to be parts of that bundle,
will face pressure to accept (i)&ndash;(iv) and hence to reject
Delegation. A related idea is discussed in connection with the Burying
Strategy in
 <a href="#ForInte1UnivTrop">Section 4.1</a>
 below.</p>

<p>
Another possible threat to <em>Delegation</em> comes from recent
literature on the mereological emergence of spacetime in quantum
gravity. According to one account, spacetime does not exist at the
fundamental level but it is <em>mereologically composed</em> of (more)
fundamental entities that are not themselves spatiotemporal. Glossing
over some details, if one holds that emergent spacetime regions are
exactly located at themselves, one will then have yet another
counterexample to <em>Delegation</em>. In effect, this is similar in
spirit to the one we discussed already. It provides an example of a
complex entity with an exact location whose proper parts are not
located anywhere (see, e.g., Baron 2020 and Baron &amp; Le Bihan
2022a). Naturally, one could turn the argument on its head and claim
that Delegation provides reason to think that the fundamental
entities, whatever they are, are not <em>parts</em> of the region.</p>

<p>
Finally, a particular view, i.e. (unrestricted) supersubstantivalism,
entails mereological harmony&mdash;see
 <a href="#SupeHarm">Section 7</a>.
 Therefore, any argument in favor of the former is an argument in
favor of the latter.</p>

<h2 id="Inte">4. Interpenetration</h2>

<p>
In this section we consider some arguments for the following
principle:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li id="Prin_nointerpenetration"><strong>No Interpenetration</strong>
<span class="nonitalic">Necessarily, if \(x\) and \(y\) have exact
locations that overlap, then \(x\) and \(y\) themselves
overlap.</span> 
\[\Box \forall x\forall y\forall z\forall w[(L(x, z) \amp L(y, w) \amp O(z, w)) \rightarrow O(x, y)]\]
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
According to No Interpenetration, it is metaphysically impossible for
entities of any type to &lsquo;pass through one another&rsquo; without
sharing parts&mdash;in the manner of a ghost passing through a solid
brick wall. There is a related principle that deserves some comment.
The related principle says that, necessarily, if \(x\)&rsquo;s exact
location is a part of \(y\)&rsquo;s exact location, then \(x\) is a
part of \(y\). In symbols:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="ex1">(1)</dt>
<dd>Necessarily, if \(x\) is exactly located at a part of
\(y\)&rsquo;s exact location, then \(x\) is part of \(y\).

\[\Box \forall x\forall y\forall z\forall w[(L(x, z) \amp L(y, w) \amp P(z, w)) \rightarrow P(x, y)]\]
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This principle may seem to say basically the same thing as No
Interpenetration but to say it more simply&mdash;using the primitive
predicate &lsquo;<em>P</em>&rsquo; instead of the defined predicate
&lsquo;\(O\)&rsquo;. Why then focus on No Interpenetration instead of
 <a href="#ex1">(1)</a>?</p>
 
<p>
The reason for this is that some of the opposition to
 <a href="#ex1">(1)</a>
 will stem from opposition to a purely mereological principle: Strong
Supplementation. It says that if every part of \(x\) overlaps \(y\),
then \(x\) is a part of \(y\). Those who deny this will be very likely
to deny (1), but they might still be attracted to No Interpenetration.
Consider for example the case of the statue Goliath and Lumpl, the
clay it is &lsquo;made out of&rsquo;. Goliath and Lumpl have the same
exact location yet one might want to deny that Goliath is part of
Lumpl (Lowe 2003). In this case they will constitute a counterexample
to (1), but insofar as they share parts, they do not constitute a
counterexample to No Interpenetration.</p>

<p>
As we noted in the introduction, in general, our task here is to set
aside the purely mereological controversies (see the entry on
 <a href="../mereology/">mereology</a>
 and Cotnoir &amp; Varzi 2021) and to focus instead on the issues that
are exclusively concerned with location and its interaction with
parthood. Too much of the controversy over
 <a href="#ex1">(1)</a>
 arises from controversy over &lsquo;pure mereology&rsquo;. By
contrast, if No Interpenetration is controversial, this is only
because of what it says about the <em>connections</em> between
parthood and location.</p>

<h3 id="ForInte1UnivTrop">4.1 For Interpenetration #1: from Universals or Tropes</h3>

<p>
Immanent realists say that a universal is in some sense &lsquo;wholly
present&rsquo; in each thing that instantiates it (Armstrong 1978: 79;
Bigelow 1988; O&rsquo;Leary-Hawthorne 1995; O&rsquo;Leary-Hawthorne
&amp; Cover 1998; Paul 2002, 2006, 2012; Newman 2002; Hawley &amp;
Bird 2011; Lafrance 2015; Peacock 2016). If immanent realism is true,
it is plausible that disjoint universals frequently
interpenetrate.</p>

<p>
Let \(e\) be an electron and suppose that it instantiates two
different universals: a mass universal, \(u_m\), and a charge
universal, \(u_c\). Suppose that \(e\) is exactly located at region
\(r\). Then it will be natural for the immanent realist to say
that</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>\(u_m\) is exactly located at \(r\), or at some region \(r_m\)
that has \(r\) as a part, and</li>

<li>\(u_c\) is exactly located at \(r\) or at some region \(r_c\) that
has \(r\) as a part.</li>
</ol>

<p>
If these universals are also instantiated elsewhere, then it will be
debatable whether they are <em>exactly</em> located at \(r\). Perhaps
\(u_m\) has only one exact location, which fuses the exact locations
of its instances (Effingham 2015b). Likewise, for \(u_c\). Either way,
the immanent realist will say that \(u_m\) and \(u_c\) have exact
locations that overlap by having \(r\) as a common part. But
presumably \(u_m\) and \(u_c\) do not overlap. If these universals are
non-structural, non-conjunctive, and perfectly natural, then they are
plausibly <em>simple</em>, in which case they overlap only if they are
identical, which they are not. A similar point can be made in terms of
 <a href="../tropes/">tropes</a>&mdash;particular,
 spatiotemporally located &lsquo;cases&rsquo; of properties or
relations. For trope theorists who take tropes to be located at
spacetime regions, it will be natural to say that mass tropes and
charges tropes, for example, frequently interpenetrate.</p>

<p>
Three responses to this argument are worth considering.</p>

<p>
The first response says: so much the worse for immanent universals and
tropes. This response uses a mereo-locational principle,
 <a href="#Prin_nointerpenetration">No Interpenetration</a>,
 as a premise in an argument against certain metaphysical views,
namely those that posit immanent universals or tropes. Is there some
reason why mereo-locational principles should not be used in this way?
The principles of pure mereology are often so used. For example, Lewis
(1999: 108&ndash;110) rejects states of affairs and structural
universals on the grounds that they would violate Uniqueness of
Composition, the principle that no entities \(xx\) have more than one
 fusion.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
 Why not give the same status to certain mereo-locational principles?
One might, for example, say that No Interpenetration is better
justified than is the view that universals or tropes are
spatiotemporally located.</p>

<p>
The second response says that while immanent universals or tropes are
spatiotemporal entities that are &lsquo;in their instances&rsquo;,
they are not exactly located anywhere. Simplified somewhat, the
response holds that</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>universals are suitably related to entities that have exact
locations, and in that sense they are &lsquo;in their
instances&rsquo;, but</li>

<li>universals do no themselves have exact locations and hence do not
have overlapping exact locations.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Given (ii), the universals or tropes in question no longer count as
examples of interpenetration. Call this the <em>Burying Strategy</em>,
since it &lsquo;buries&rsquo; universals and/or tropes in located
entities, rather than treating them as being located&mdash;examples
are found in Armstrong (1989: 99) and Lowe (2006: 25).</p>

<p>
The third response to the argument from universals and tropes is to
say, &lsquo;True, universals and/or tropes can interpenetrate, but
material objects can&rsquo;t&rsquo;. This grants the argument and
rejects
 <a href="#Prin_nointerpenetration">No Interpenetration</a>
 in favor of the weaker, restricted principle below, where \(M\)
stands for the &lsquo;material object&rsquo; predicate:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="ex2">(2)</dt>
<dd>Necessarily, if material objects \(x\) and \(y\) have exact
locations that overlap, then \(x\) and \(y\) themselves overlap.

</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This response also handles potential counterexamples to
 <a href="#Prin_nointerpenetration">No Interpenetration</a>
 arising from regions, sets, events, portions of stuff, holes,
spirits, and other &lsquo;immaterial entities&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
On the location of regions, see Casati &amp; Varzi (1999: 123), who
hold that regions are located at themselves, and Simons (2004b: 345),
who holds that nothing is located at itself. On the location of sets,
see Maddy (1990); Lewis (1991); Effingham (2010, 2012); and Cook
(2012). On the location of events, see Casati &amp; Varzi (1999);
Price (2008); Giordani &amp; Costa (2013); Costa &amp; Giordani
(2016); and Costa (2017). On the location of portions of stuff, see
Markosian (1998, 2004, 2015). On the location of holes and shadows,
see Lewis &amp; Lewis (1970); Casati &amp; Varzi (1994); Wake,
Spencer, &amp; Fowler (2007); Donnelly, Bittner, &amp; Rosse (2006);
and Sorensen (2008). On the location of spirits, see Thomas (2009) and
Inman (2017). Sanford (1970) discusses many of these topics, and
Hudson (2005: 4) mentions many of them briefly.</p>

<p>
The next two pro-interpenetration arguments count equally against
 <a href="#Prin_nointerpenetration">No Interpenetration</a>
 and
 <a href="#ex2">(2)</a>,
 but we will continue to focus on No Interpenetration for
simplicity.</p>

<h3 id="ForInte2Conc">4.2 For Interpenetration #2: from Conceivability</h3>

<p>
Some think that it is possible for two disjoint <em>material
objects</em> to have overlapping exact locations. Perhaps there are no
actual cases of the relevant sort. Such cases may even be nomically
impossible&mdash;ruled out by the laws of nature (though see the next
section). But one might still think that these cases are
metaphysically possible.</p>

<p>
After all, what is it that keeps material objects from
interpenetrating in the actual world? Repulsive forces, presumably.
But a standard view is that the laws governing such forces are not
metaphysically
 necessary.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 And on that assumption it is natural to conclude that there are
metaphysically possible worlds in which any repulsive forces that
exist can be overridden in such a way as to allow material objects to
interpenetrate. (For more on this, see Zimmerman 1996a and Sider
2000.)</p>

<p>
A similar line of thought is sometimes framed as a conceivability
argument. One might take cases of interpenetration to be conceivable
or intuitively possible, and one might take this to be some evidence
for their possibility. In <em>New Essays the Human Understanding</em>
(II.xxvii.1), Leibniz writes that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
we find that two shadows or two rays of light interpenetrate, and we
could devise an imaginary world where bodies did the same. (1704
[1996]).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Sanford (1967: 37) describes a similar scenario in more detail.</p>

<h3 id="ForInte3Boso">4.3 For Interpenetration #3: from Bosons</h3>

<p>
Does contemporary physics provide us with examples of disjoint
fundamental particles that have the same, or overlapping, exact
locations? Hawthorne and Uzquiano apparently claim that the answer is
&lsquo;Yes&rsquo;. They write that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
particles having integral spin&mdash;otherwise known as
bosons&mdash;in modern particle physics (&hellip;) are generally
thought to be point-sized. Moreover (&hellip;) bosons are perfectly
well able to cohabit a single spacetime point. (2011: 3&ndash;4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Schaffer (2009a) suggests that in the case at hand, we are not forced
to consider the conceived scenario as one in which there are two
co-located yet disjoint bosons. Rather,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[a] more sophisticated treatment of these cases involves field theory.
Instead of there being two bosons co-located at region <em>r</em>,
there is a bosonic field with doubled intensity at <em>r</em>. (2009a:
140).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Whereas Hawthorne and Uzquiano apparently take bosons to provide
<em>actual</em> examples of interpenetration, McDaniel (2007a: 240)
suggests that they at least reinforce the conceivability of such
counterexamples and therefore their possibility should not be
discarded <em>a priori</em>.</p>

<p>
If one&rsquo;s goal, in constructing a theory of location, is to
articulate the necessary and <em>a priori</em> truths governing
location and its interaction with parthood, then even McDaniel&rsquo;s
modest point still counts against including
 <a href="#Prin_nointerpenetration">No Interpenetration</a>
 in one&rsquo;s theory. For if McDaniel is right, then that principle
is not an <em>a priori</em> truth, though perhaps it is still a
necessary truth. (See Simons 1994 &amp; 2004a for further discussion
of bosons and for related considerations in support of
interpenetration. For further discussion of Hawthorne and Uzquiano,
see Cotnoir 2016.)</p>

<h3 id="ForInte4Reco">4.4 For Interpenetration #4: from Recombination</h3>

<p>
Sider (2000: 585&ndash;6), McDaniel (2007a), and Saucedo (2011) have
all objected to
 <a href="#Prin_nointerpenetration">No Interpenetration</a>
 on the grounds that it conflicts with plausible broadly Humean
&lsquo;principles of recombination&rsquo;. The following is a
reconstruction of the argument in McDaniel&rsquo;s (2007a: 241).</p>

<p>
Let \(o_1\) and \(o_2\) be two different objects, let \(r\) be a
region, and consider the following states of affairs:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="s1">\((s_1)\)</dt>
<dd>\(o_1\)&rsquo;s being simple and exactly located at \(r\)</dd>
</dl>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="s2">\((s_2)\)</dt>
<dd>\(o_2\)&rsquo;s being simple and exactly located at \(r\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Then we can reconstruct the argument as follows:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="P1">(P1)</dt>
 <dd><a href="#s1">\(s_1\)</a>
 is a contingent state of affairs.</dd>
<dt id="P2">(P2)</dt>
 <dd><a href="#s2">\(s_2\)</a>
 is a contingent state of affairs.</dd>
<dt id="P3">(P3)</dt>
 <dd><a href="#s1">\(s_1\)</a>
 is distinct from
 <a href="#s2">\(s_2\)</a>.</dd>
 <dt id="P4">(P4)</dt>
<dd>For any \(x\) and any \(y\), if \(x\) and \(y\) are each
contingent states of affairs, and if they are distinct from each
other, then possibly, both \(x\) and \(y\) obtain.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
<em>Therefore</em></p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="conclusion">(C)</dt>
<dd>Possibly, both
 <a href="#s1">\(s_1\)</a>
 and
 <a href="#s2">\(s_2\)</a>
 obtain.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
If it&rsquo;s possible for both
 <a href="#s1">\(s_1\)</a>
 and
 <a href="#s2">\(s_2\)</a>
 to obtain, then it&rsquo;s possible for a given region to be the
exact location of two different simples. And since no two simples can
overlap, this would mean that it&rsquo;s possible for disjoint things
(the simples) to have identical (hence overlapping) exact
locations.</p>

<p>
Is the argument successful? As Sider and McDaniel are well aware, the
notion of distinctness in the formulation of Humean recombination
principles needs to be handled with care if P4 is to get off the
ground. As a way of illustration, it cannot be simple <em>numerical
distinctness</em>. If it were, the state of affairs that <em>p</em>
and the state of affairs that <em>not <em>p</em></em> would be
recombinable to yield a genuine metaphysical possibility. For another
example, the state of affairs that <em>x</em> is green and the state
of affairs that <em>x</em> is scarlet could be recombinable to yield
yet another genuine metaphysical
 possibility.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup>
 But it is no easy matter to give &lsquo;distinct from&rsquo; a
meaning that makes
 <a href="#P3">P3</a>
 and
 <a href="#P4">P4</a>
 simultaneously plausible. If it means &lsquo;shares no parts or
constituents with&rsquo;, then P4 avoids the counterexample given
above, but P3 ceases to be plausible, since
 <a href="#s1">\(s_1\)</a>
 and
 <a href="#s2">\(s_2\)</a>
 do plausibly share a constituent, namely <em>r</em>. If &lsquo;\(s\)
is distinct from \(s^*\)&rsquo; is defined as</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>possibly, \(s\) obtains and \(s^*\) does not,</li>

<li>possibly, neither \(s\) nor \(s^*\) obtains, and</li>

<li>possibly, both \(s\) and \(s^*\) obtain&rsquo;,</li>
</ol>

<p>
then
 <a href="#P4">P4</a>
 is trivially true, but
 <a href="#P3">P3</a>
 begs the question&mdash;see also Lo and Lin (2023).</p>

<h2 id="ExteSimpUnexComp">5. Extended Simples and Unextended Complexes</h2>

<p>
A simple is an entity that has no proper parts. Are there any simples?
Within the realm of spatiotemporal entities, some natural candidates
are: spacetime points, fundamental particles such as electrons (or
instantaneous temporal parts of them), and perhaps certain universals,
certain tropes, or certain sets. On the other hand, it would seem to
be an empirically open possibility that all spatiotemporal entities
are gunky.</p>

<p>
Say that an entity is <em>extended</em> just in case it is a
spatiotemporal entity and does not have the shape and size of a point.
In this sense of &lsquo;extended&rsquo;, a solid cube would count as
extended, but, given natural assumptions, so would a fusion of two
point-particles that are one foot apart. Although such a fusion is
naturally taken to have zero length, it would be a scattered object
and so would not have the shape of a point.</p>

<p>
Are there any extended simples? Could there be? Those who answer
&lsquo;No&rsquo; to both questions will be inclined to accept</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li id="NXS"><strong>No Extended Simples</strong> (NXS) <span class="nonitalic">Necessarily,
if \(x\) is exactly located at \(y\)
and \(y\) is complex, then \(x\) is complex.</span> 
\[\Box \forall x\forall y[[L(x, y) \amp C(y)] \rightarrow C(x)]\]
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Strictly speaking,
 <a href="#NXS">NXS</a>
 does not say that extended simples are impossible; rather, it says
that simples with complex exact locations are impossible. It leaves
open the possibility that there are extended simple regions and
extended simple entities that are exactly located at them. (For more
on extended simple regions and discrete space or spacetime, see
Forrest 1995; Tognazzini 2006; Braddon-Mitchell &amp; Miller 2006;
McDaniel 2007b, 2007c; Dainton 2010: 294&ndash;301; Spencer 2010,
2014; Hagar 2014; Jaeger 2014; Kleinschmidt 2016; Goodsell et al.
2020; and Baron &amp; Le Bihan 2022b.) And NXS rules out the
possibility that there is a point-sized material simple that is
exactly located at a point-sized but mereologically complex region
(e.g., a region that is the fusion of several point-sized tropes each
of which is at zero distance from each of the others).</p>

<p>
For the most part, however, it will do no harm to treat the debate
over extended simples as a debate over NXS. We can do so if we assume
that, necessarily, a region is extended if and only if it is complex.
So, in what follows, we will operate under that assumption unless we
explicitly note otherwise.</p>

<p>
Unextended complexes are objects that are mereologically complex and
exactly located at regions that are simple and so, we assume,
pointlike. Are there unextended complexes? Could there be? Those who
answer &lsquo;No&rsquo; to both questions will be inclined to
accept:</p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>

<h3 id="ForExteSimp1Conc">5.1 For Extended Simples #1: from Conceivability</h3>

<p>
An initial argument appeals to the claim that extended simples are
conceivable and takes that to be some evidence in favor of their
possibility. To conceive of an extended simple, think of an
extended&mdash;say, cubical&mdash;object that has no proper parts. The
idea is not, or not merely, that the cube <em>cannot be physically
split or cut up</em>. Whether or not it can be split is a separate
question.</p>

<p>
Debates about extended simples typically focus on the question of
whether extended simple material objects are possible. But entities in
other ontological categories (tropes, universals, sets, regions) are
sometimes thought to be located. So it is worth keeping in mind that,
whatever one thinks about material objects, one might hold that
extended simples in other categories are possible. With that said, we
will focus on material objects for the remainder of this section.</p>

<h3 id="ForExteSimp2StriTheo">5.2 For Extended Simples #2: from String Theory</h3>

<p>
As McDaniel (2007a: 235&ndash;6) notes, some physicists interpret
string theory as positing extended simples. McDaniel quotes a passage
from Brian Greene:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
What are strings made of? There are two possible answers to this
question. First, strings are truly fundamental&mdash;they are
&ldquo;atoms,&rdquo; <em>uncuttable</em> constituents&hellip;. From
this perspective, even though strings have spatial extent, the
question of their composition is without any content. (1999: 141)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Can strings be treated as being identical to the spacetime regions at
which they are exactly located? Greene does not explicitly address
this question. If the answer is &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;, however, and if
strings are exactly located only at complex regions, then string
theory would not be committed to extended simples after all. For an
argument that string theory does not posit extended simples, see Baker
(2016). For a discussion of different arguments for and against
extended simples in quantum gravity see Baron and LeBihan (2022b).</p>

<h3 id="ForExteSimp3Reco">5.3 For Extended Simples #3: from Recombination</h3>

<p>
As with interpenetration, one might offer a recombination argument for
the possibility of extended simples (Sider 2007; McDaniel 2007b;
Saucedo 2011). One could claim that being simple and being a simple
region are accidental properties that can be recombined to yield a
state of affairs in which a simple is exactly located at a
complex&mdash;and therefore, we take it, extended&mdash;region. Since
this argument does not appear to raise any issues that are specific to
extended simples, we will move on.</p>

<h3 id="AgaiExteSimp1QualVari">5.4 Against Extended Simples #1: from Qualitative Variation</h3>

<p>
One might argue that if extended simples were possible, then they
could vary qualitatively across space or
 spacetime.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup>
 An ordinary hammer can vary qualitatively over space by having a
white handle and a non-white (say, gray) head. Likewise, one might
think that if extended simples were possible then there could be an
extended, hammer-shaped simple that varies in color across space in
the manner of an ordinary hammer with a white handle and a non-white
head. It is tempting to say that, if there were such a simple, then
one part of it would be white and one part would be non-white. But
since the simple has only one part, itself, this would entail that the
simple itself is both white and non-white. This being impossible, one
might conclude that extended simples quite generally are
impossible.</p>

<p>
One might resist the argument by insisting that extended simples are
possible only if qualitatively homogeneous across spacetime (see
Spencer 2010, Jaeger 2014, and Spencer 2014 for discussion). But most
friends of extended simples try to resist the argument in other
ways.</p>

<p>
In this connection, it is useful to see that the problem of
qualitative variation perfectly mirrors the infamous problem of change
(a.k.a., temporary intrinsics), which deals with the case of a
persisting entity exhibiting qualitative variation across time.
Consequently, several solutions developed for the problem of change
apply, <em>mutatis mutandis</em>, to the case of extended simples. For
example, a friend of extended simples might adopt regionalized
properties or regionalized instantiation (the terminology is due to
Schaffer 2010). In the first case, a seemingly monadic property such
as being white is really taken to be a relation to a region in
disguise, such as being <em>white at</em>. In the second case, one
regionalizes instantiation rather than the property by claiming, for
example, that the extended simple instantiates-here whiteness. These
two strategies parallel the classic relativization strategies of,
e.g., Mellor (1981) and adverbialist strategy of, e.g., Johnston
(1987) and Haslanger (1989).</p>

<p>
Yet another strategy is worth mentioning here, because it was
developed originally to deal with qualitative variation in extended
simples. This is Parsons&rsquo; (2000) solution involving
distributional properties. Parsons proposes that if a simple is white
in one region and gray in another, then it has a fundamental,
intrinsic, distributional property. Some distributional properties,
such as being black all over, are uniform. Others, such as being
polka-dotted, are non-uniform. When a simple has a non-uniform
distributional property, this fact is not grounded in it having proper
parts, configured in a certain way, that each have simpler, uniform
properties. Nor is it grounded in the simple&rsquo;s standing in
different relations (being white at and being gray at) to different
spacetime regions. Rather, it is an ungrounded fact about the simple.
This apparently avoids the worries faced by previous approaches (on
which see Haslanger 2003). As McDaniel (2009) notes, however,
Parsons&rsquo;s solution faces several difficulties. For example, it
seems unable to provide an account of what is it for \(x\) to be \(F\)
at \(r\). What is it, for example, for something to be gray at a
region \(r\)? It can&rsquo;t simply be for it to have a given
distributional property \(D\), such as being gray all over. And this
for at least two reasons. First, something could be gray at \(r\) in
virtue of having other distributional properties, such as being half
gray and half white. Second, something could have the relevant
distributional property without being gray at \(r\), for example
because it is not located at \(r\). The problem is not solved if we
further require the thing to be located at \(r\). Indeed, two circles
that are co-located at \(r\) and have both the distributional property
of being half gray and half white might be such that one is gray at
the top part of their exact location while the other is gray at the
bottom part.</p>

<p>
As we point out in the supplementary document
 <a href="systems-of-location.html">Systems of Location</a>
 some theories of location rule out extended simples by
definition.</p>

<h3 id="ForUnexComp">5.5 For Unextended Complexes</h3>

<p>
What about unextended complexes? McDaniel (2007b), Pickup (2016), and
Calosi (2023) all discuss their possibility (but see also Leonard
2016, which labels them &ldquo;crowded simples&rdquo;).</p>

<p>
A first argument, due to McDaniel, goes as follows:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>point-like entities are possible;</li>

<li>co-located point-like entities are possible;</li>

<li>fusions of point-like co-located entities are possible.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Fusions of co-located point-like entities qualify as unextended
complexes. Pickup suggests that there is another way a complex entity
might be exactly located at a single point: the parts of the pointy
complex do not have exact locations, but the pointy complex has one,
namely the relevant point. (We touched upon this when discussing
possible violations of Delegation.) For the purpose of this entry, it
is interesting to note that the two cases discussed above violate very
different principles about the interaction between parthood and
location. In the first case both Injectivity and Conditional
Injectivity of Location in
 <a href="#IntePart">Section 3</a>
 are violated. Therefore, any argument against interpenetration will
count against this particular kind of unextended complex.</p>

<p>
In the second case, the following principle will be violated:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Expansivity*:</strong> <span class="nonitalic">Necessarily,
if \(x\) is part of \(y\) and \(y\) is
exactly located at \(w\), then there is a subregion \(z\) of \(w\)
such that \(x\) is exactly located at \(w\).</span> 

\[\Box \forall x
\forall y \forall w [ P(x, y) \amp L(y, w) \rightarrow \exists z
(P(z, w) \amp L(x, w))] \]</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
We should note that Expansivity* is similar (in spirit) to Expansivity
in
 <a href="#IntePart">Section 3</a>,
 but is slightly stronger. Depending on whether one takes the parts of
the pointy complex to have at least weak locations&mdash;Pickup being
silent on that&mdash;one would also have a violation of</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Exactness +</strong>: <span class="nonitalic">Necessarily,
if a thing is weakly located somewhere, then it is exactly located
somewhere.</span> 
\[\Box \forall x [\exists y \WKL (x, y) \rightarrow \exists y L(x, y)]\]
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Pickup offers yet another argument in favor of the possibility of
unextended complexes. The argument has it that unless a reason is
given for the difference between the case of extended simples and the
case of unextended complexes one should treat their possibilities
equally. That is, if one finds extended simples possible, then one
should find unextended complexes possible as well. A possible reply is
that, as we saw, extended simples and unextended complexes violate
very different principles of location. One could have different
attitudes towards those principles which would then warrant different
attitudes towards the metaphysical possibility of the (allegedly)
problematic entities&mdash;see for example, Calosi (2023).</p>

<h2 id="Mult">6. Multilocation</h2>

<p>
To say that an object is multilocated is to say that it has more than
one exact location: &lsquo;\(x\) is multilocated&rsquo; means</p>

<p>

\[\exists y_1\exists y_2 [L(x, y_1) \amp L(x, y_2) \amp y_1\ne y_2].\]
</p>

<p>
(For an attempt to motivate a slightly different definition of
multilocation, designed to allow for cases of multilocation in absence
of exact location, see Calosi 2022a, Correia 2022.) We consider a
series of putative <em>examples</em> of multi-location in
 <a href="#ForMult3Exam">Section 6.3</a>.</p>
 
<p>
The debate over multilocation concerns</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Functionality+</strong> <span class="nonitalic">Necessarily,
nothing has more than one exact
location.</span> 
\[\Box \forall x\forall y_1\forall y_2 [[L(x, y_1) \amp L(x, y_2)] \rightarrow y_1 =y_2]\]
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Opponents of multilocation accept Functionality+. Friends of
multilocation typically want to affirm something stronger than the
negation of Functionality+. They typically accept the possibility of
an entity that is exactly located at each of two regions that do not
even overlap.</p>

<p>
Earlier we glossed &lsquo;\(x\) is exactly located at \(y\)&rsquo; as
&lsquo;\(x\) has (or has-at\(-y)\) the same size and shape as \(y\),
and stands (or stands-at\(-y)\) in all the same spatiotemporal
relations to things as does \(y\)&rsquo;. Thus, spheres are exactly
located only at spherical regions, cubes only at cubical regions, and
so on. When an entity is said to be multilocated, then, it is said to
stand in this relation to <em>each of several regions</em>: informally
put, it has the same size, shape, and position as region \(r_1\); it
has the same size, shape, and position as region \(r_2\); and so on.
No claim is made to the effect that the object is exactly located at
the <em>fusion</em> of \(r_1, r_2,\ldots\), or at any <em>proper
parts</em> of any of these regions.</p>

<p>
To clarify the idea of multilocation in an informal way, it may be
useful to consider

<p>
The object \(o_1\) is scattered: its shape is that of the sum of two
non-overlapping circles. It is not multilocated. Rather, it has just
one exact location: the scattered region \(r_3\). It is not exactly
located at any proper part of that region, such as \(r_1\) or
\(r_2\).</p>

<p>
The object \(o_2\) is multilocated. It has two (and only two) exact
locations. It is exactly located at the circular region \(r_3\); and
it is exactly located at the circular region \(r_4\), which does not
overlap \(r_3\). It is not exactly located at their fusion, and it is
not located at any of their proper parts. Since \(o_2\) is exactly
located at \(r_3\), which is circular, \(o_2\) is circular, at least
<em>at \(r_3\)</em>. For parallel reasons, \(o_2\) is circular at
\(r_4\). By contrast, \(o_1\) is not circular <em>simpliciter</em>,
nor is it circular at any region.</p>

<p>
Everything we have said so far is neutral with respect to whether
either of the material objects is simple. It may be that both objects
are simple, or that both are complex, or that \(o_1\) is simple and
\(o_2\) is complex, or <em>vice versa</em>. This is worth emphasizing,
since questions about the possibility of extended simples and
questions about the possibility of multilocation are sometimes run
together.</p>

<p>
It is natural to think that if these two objects were visible, they
would be visually indistinguishable. Indeed, it is tempting to think
that there would be no empirical difference between \(o_1\) and
\(o_2\). For those with verificationist leanings, this may lead to the
belief that there is no difference at all between \(o_1\) and \(o_2\)
and hence that there must be something defective about the initial
set-up of the case.</p>

<h3 id="ForMult1Conc">6.1 For Multilocation #1: from Conceivability</h3>

<p>
As with interpenetration and extended simples, one might offer a
conceivability argument for the possibility of multilocation. One
could claim that multilocation is conceivable and take this to be
evidence that multilocation is possible. Since this argument does not
appear to raise any issues that are specific to multilocation, we will
move on.</p>

<h3 id="ForMult2Reco">6.2 For Multilocation #2: from Recombination</h3>

<p>
As with interpenetration and extended simples, one might offer a
recombination argument for the possibility of multilocation. One could
claim that exact location is fundamental and accidental and take this
to be evidence that multilocation is possible. Since this argument,
too, appears not to raise any issues that are specific to
multilocation, we will move on.</p>

<h3 id="ForMult3Exam">6.3 For Multilocation #3: from Examples</h3>

<p>
Arguments in favor of multilocation may simply come from concrete
examples of multilocated entities. These include: immanent universals,
enduring material objects, enduring tropes&mdash;Ehring (1997a,b,
2011), four-dimensional perduring objects&mdash;Hudson (2001),
backward time travelers&mdash;(MacBride 1998, Keller &amp; Nelson
2001; Gilmore 2003, 2006, 2007; Miller 2006; Carroll 2011;
Kleinschmidt 2011; Effingham 2011), fission products&mdash;Dainton
(2008: 364&ndash;408), transworld individuals&mdash;McDaniel (2004),
works of music&mdash;Tillman (2011), and an omnipresent
God&mdash;(Hudson 2009; Inman
 2017).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>
 We will focus on the first two examples here for they are arguably
the more widely discussed.</p>

<h4 id="ImmaUniv">6.3.1 Immanent universals</h4>

<p>
As we have noted, immanent realists say that universals are
spatiotemporal entities that are in some sense &lsquo;wholly
present&rsquo; in the things that instantiate them. One natural way to
translate immanent realism into the terminology of exact location is
via the following principle:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="ex3">(3)</dt>
<dd>Necessarily, for any \(x\), any \(y\), and any \(z\), if \(x\) is
exactly located at \(y\) and \(x\) instantiates \(z\), then \(z\) is
exactly located at \(y\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
To see how this leads to multilocation, suppose that some monadic
universal \(u\) is instantiated by an entity \(e_1\) that is exactly
located at region \(r_1\) and by a different entity, \(e_2\), that is
exactly located at region \(r_2\), disjoint from \(r_1\). Then, given
(3), \(u\) itself is exactly located both at \(r_1\) and at \(r_2\)
(Paul 2006; Lafrance 2015).</p>

<p>

 <a href="#ex3">(3)</a>
 is not inevitable, even for immanent realists. Some of them might
prefer to say that a monadic universal is exactly located only at the
<em>fusion</em> of the exact locations of its instances (Bigelow 1988:
18&ndash;27, can in places be read as embracing this, and Effingham
2015b argues that this is what immanent realists should say). On this
view, a simple monadic universal might be scattered but would not be
multilocated. Others (Armstrong 1989: 99) prefer to say that
universals do not have exact locations at all, though they are parts
or constituents of things that have exact locations or of spacetime
itself. This was dubbed the &lsquo;Burying Strategy&rsquo; in
 <a href="#ForInte1UnivTrop">Section 4.1</a>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h4 id="EnduMateObje">6.3.2 Enduring material objects</h4>

<p>
The debate over persistence of <em>material objects</em> through time
centers around two rival views, endurantism and
 perdurantism.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>
 Endurantists often say that a persisting material object is
temporally unextended and in some sense &lsquo;wholly present&rsquo;
at each instant of its career. Perdurantists often say that a
persisting material object is a temporally extended entity that has a
different temporal part at each different instant of its career and is
at most partially present at any one instant (Informally, an
instantaneous temporal part of Obama is an object that is a part of
Obama, is made of the exactly same matter as Obama is whenever it
exists, and has exactly the same spatial location as Obama does
whenever it exists, but exists at only a single
 instant.)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Some philosophers have suggested that the traditional endurantism
versus perdurantism dispute runs together a pair of independent
disputes about persistence: a mereological dispute concerning the
existence of temporal parts, and a locational dispute concerning exact
locations (Gilmore 2006, 2008; Hawthorne 2006; Sattig 2006; Donnelly
2010, 2011b; Eddon 2010; Rychter 2011; Calosi &amp; Fano 2015). Stated
loosely, the mereological dispute is between the following views:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Mereological perdurance:</strong> there are persisting
material objects, and each such object has a different temporal part
at each different instant at which the object exists.</li>

<li><strong>Mereological endurance:</strong> there are persisting
material objects, but none of them has a different temporal part at
each different instant of its career. (Perhaps none of them have any
instantaneous temporal parts&mdash;or any temporal parts aside from
themselves&mdash;at all.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
To frame the locational dispute, it will be useful to have one further
piece of terminology. Say that \(y\) is a <em>path</em> of \(x\) if
and only if \(y\) is a fusion of the exact locations of \(x\) (Gilmore
2006: 204). Informally, a path of an object is a region at which the
object&rsquo;s complete career is exactly located.</p>

<p>
We can then state the locational dispute as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Locational perdurance:</strong> there are persisting
material objects, and each of them has exactly one exact
location&mdash;its path.</li>

<li><strong>Locational endurance:</strong> there are persisting
material objects, and each of them has many different exact locations,
each such location being instantaneous or &lsquo;spacelike&rsquo;.
Typically, each of these exact locations will count as an
instantaneous temporal part of the object&rsquo;s path.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Philosophers on both sides of this dispute can agree about which
spacetime regions are the paths of which material
objects&mdash;provided they agree that the relevant persisting objects
exist. They will disagree about which spacetime regions are the exact
locations of which objects. The locational perdurantist will say that
material objects are exactly located only at their paths. The
locational endurantist will say that a persisting material object is
exactly located at many regions, each of them a slice of its path. The
interaction between the two disputes about persistence is summarized
in
 <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>
 (from Gilmore 2008: 1230).</p>

<p>
Locational endurance entails multilocation: it says that some material
objects are exactly located at many different regions (for a
locational characterization of endurantism that does not entail
multilocation see Garcia forthcoming). Mereological endurance, which
merely rejects temporal parts, does not entail multilocation. Thus,
one might reject temporal parts while retaining Functionality. This is
the position of Parsons (2000, 2007). It corresponds to the lower
left-hand box in
 <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="AgaiMult1Defi">6.4 Against Multilocation #1: from Definition</h3>

<p>
As we noted in
 <a href="#WhicLocaRelaFund">Section 2.1</a>,
 Parsons (2007) develops a theory of location on which weak location
is primitive and exact location is defined, via definition (DS2a.1).
According to that definition, &lsquo;\(x\) is exactly located at
\(y\)&rsquo; means the same as &lsquo;\(x\) is weakly located at all
and only those entities that overlap \(y\)&rsquo;. Those who endorse
this definition may deny the possibility of multilocation, on the
basis of the following argument:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="ex4">(4)</dt>
<dd>Necessarily, for any \(x\) and any \(y, x\) is exactly located at
\(y\) if and only if for any \(y^*\), \(x\) is weakly located at
\(y^*\) if and only \(y\) overlaps \(y^*\) (Definition of
&lsquo;\(L\)&rsquo;).</dd>
<dt id="ex5">(5)</dt>
<dd>So, necessarily, for any \(x\), any \(y_1\), and any \(y_2\), if
\(x\) is exactly located at \(y_1\) and \(x\) is exactly located at
\(y_2\), then \(y_1\) overlaps exactly the same things as \(y_2\)
(from
 <a href="#ex4">(4)</a>).</dd>
 <dt id="ex6">(6)</dt>
<dd>Necessarily, for any \(y_1\) and any \(y_2\), if something is
exactly located at \(y_1\) and something is exactly located at \(y_2\)
and \(y_1\) overlaps exactly the same things as \(y_2\), then \(y_1
=y_2\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
<em>Therefore</em></p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="ex7">(7)</dt>
<dd>Necessarily, for any \(x\), and \(y_1\) and any \(y_2\), if \(x\)
is exactly located at \(y_1\) and \(x\) is exactly located at \(y_2\),
then \(y_1 =y_2\) (from
 <a href="#ex5">(5)</a>
 and
 <a href="#ex6">(6)</a>.)</dd>
 </dl>

<p>
To see that the inference from
 <a href="#ex4">(4)</a>
 to
 <a href="#ex5">(5)</a>
 is valid, suppose that object \(o\) is exactly located at regions
\(r_a\) and \(r_b\). Since \(o\) is exactly located at \(r_a, o\) is
(by (4)) weakly located at all and only the entities that overlap
\(r_a\). Likewise, since \(o\) is exactly located at \(r_b, o\) is
weakly located at all and only the entities that overlap \(r_b\). So
\(r_a\) overlaps a given entity if and only if \(o\) is weakly located
at that entity; and \(r_b\) overlaps a given entity if and only if
\(o\) is weakly located at that entity. Hence \(r_a\) and \(r_b\)
overlap exactly the same entities. The rest of the argument is
self-explanatory.</p>

<p>
The argument may persuade some. However, those who are initially
inclined to take the possibility of multilocation seriously may see
this argument as a reason to doubt the first premise and the
associated definition (Gilmore 2006: 203; Effingham 2015b).</p>

<p>
Interestingly, in the supplementary document
 <a href="systems-of-location.html">Systems of Location</a>,
 we present three systems&mdash;namely systems 3, 4 and 5&mdash;that
allow for multilocation but rule out specific kinds of multilocation,
in particular <em>nested</em> <em>multilocation</em>, in which
something is exactly located at a region \(r\) and at one or more of
\(r\)&rsquo;s proper subregions. Kleinschmidt (2011) argues that
certain types of nested multilocation entail a violation of the
partial ordering axioms of parthood&mdash;see
 <a href="#AgaiMult3MereStruOccu">Section 6.6</a>.</p>
 
<h3 id="AgaiMult2QualVari">6.5 Against Multilocation #2: from Qualitative Variation</h3>

<p>
Extended simples face a problem arising from qualitative variation.
Multilocated entities face a similar problem, insofar as a
multilocated entity might instantiate incompatible properties at
different locations. When such locations are temporally separated,
such cases are in fact cases of change.</p>

<p>
Some friends of multilocation might insist that multilocation is
possible, but only for entities, such as universals or tropes, that do
not vary qualitatively between locations. However, friends of
multilocation usually defend the claim that multilocation is possible
even for entities that do vary between locations and try to resist the
argument by adopting other strategies. Such strategies mirror those
applied to the case of the problem of change and that of qualitative
variation in extended simples, and they appear to have the same
virtues and vices here as in those contexts.</p>

<h3 id="AgaiMult3MereStruOccu">6.6 Against Multilocation #3: from the Mereological Structure of Occupants</h3>

<p>
There are a few arguments against multilocation that share a common
structure. These arguments have it that multilocation is inconsistent
with particular mereological structures of occupants. If one holds
that occupants have at least the relevant mereological structure, one
has an argument against multilocation. Following Varzi (2003) [2019])
we stipulate:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul>

<li><strong>Ground Mereology:</strong> The mereological theory that
only comprises the partial ordering axioms for parthood.</li>

<li><strong>Minimal Mereology:</strong> Ground Mereology plus Weak
Supplementation.</li>

<li><strong>Classical Extensional Mereology</strong>: Ground
Mereology, plus Strong Supplementation and Unrestricted
Composition.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Given these stipulations, the different arguments take a more specific
 shape:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup></p>
 
<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li><em>Ground Mereology Argument</em>: Multilocation is inconsistent
with Ground Mereology (Kleinschmidt 2011).</li>

<li><em>Minimal Mereology Argument</em>: Multilocation is inconsistent
with Minimal Mereology (Effingham &amp; Robson 2007).</li>

<li><em>Classical Mereology Argument</em>: Multilocation is
inconsistent with Classical Extensional Mereology (Calosi 2014).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
The Classical Mereology Argument depends crucially on other admittedly
controversial principles of location we did not mention. We will
therefore not discuss the argument (see Smid 2023a for a discussion
and response).</p>

<h4 id="GrouMereMult">6.6.1 Ground Mereology and Multilocation</h4>

<p>
Kleinschmidt (2011) argues that multilocation is inconsistent with
Ground Mereology for
 occupants.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-16" id="ref-16">16</a>]</sup>
 More precisely, what is inconsistent with Ground Mereology for
occupants is a particular kind of multilocation, nested multilocation.
In Kleinschmidt&rsquo;s own words:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li id="claim1"><strong>Claim 1:</strong> It is possible that there
exists some objects, \(x\) and \(y\), and regions \(r_1, r_2\), and
\(r_3\), such that \(x\) is located at \(r_1, y\) is located at \(r_2,
x\) is located at \(r_3\), and \(x\) is (at \(r_1)\) a proper part of
\(y\) (at \(r_2)\) which is a proper part of \(x\) at \((r_3)\)
(Kleinschmidt 2011: 256)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Consider the following scenario. <em>Clifford</em> is a statue of a
dog that is made of smaller statues. One such smaller statue is
<em>Kibble</em>, a statue of a biscuit. <em>Kibble</em> itself is made
of smaller statues, in particular a small statue of a dog,
<em>Odie</em>. Kleinschmidt maintains we should agree to the
following:</p>

<dl class="sentag" id="ex810">
<dt id="ex8">(8)</dt>
<dd><em>Kibble</em> is a proper part of <em>Clifford</em></dd>
<dd>\(\PP(k, c)\)</dd>
<dt id="ex9">(9)</dt>
<dd><em>Odie</em> is a proper part of <em>Kibble</em></dd>
<dd>\(\PP(o, k)\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
But it turns out that <em>Odie</em> is a time traveling
<em>Clifford</em> that shrank a little. Thus,</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="ex10">(10)</dt>
<dd><em>Clifford</em> is numerically identical with <em>Odie</em></dd>
<dd>\(c = o\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Setting <em>Clifford</em> \(=\) <em>Odie</em> \(= x\) and
<em>Kibble</em> \(= y\) one gets an example of the locational pattern
in
 <a href="#claim1">Claim 1</a>.
 Indeed, <em>Clifford</em> \((=\) <em>Odie</em>) is multilocated at
two regions which are a proper part and a proper extension of the
location of <em>Kibble</em>. It is easy to see that
 <a href="#ex810">(8)&ndash;(10)</a>
 violate the conjunction of Transitivity and Asymmetry of proper
parthood, which are theorems of Ground Mereology. Hence the
conclusion: Ground Mereology is inconsistent with multilocation.</p>

<p>
Let us consider some possible replies. A first one consists in noting
that Kleinschmidt&rsquo;s case rests on the possibility of a very
particular kind of multilocation, &lsquo;nested multilocation&rsquo;.
One might simply deny the possibility of such particular kind. Indeed,
this is exactly the case according to some systems of location we
discuss in the supplementary document
 <a href="systems-of-location.html">Systems of Location</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Another response has it that, once we are told that <em>Clifford</em>
= <em>Odie</em> (i.e.,
 <a href="#ex10">(10)</a>
 above) we should simply deny that <em>Odie</em> is a proper part of
<em>Kibble</em> (i.e.,
 <a href="#ex9">(9)</a>
 above). Kleinschmidt anticipates something similar and replies:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
When we started describing the case, we noted that <em>Odie</em> was a
proper part of <em>Kibble</em>, which was a proper part of
<em>Clifford</em>. Finding out that <em>Odie</em> is actually a
time-traveler shouldn&rsquo;t change the parthood relations we say he
stands in at that time. (2011: 257)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This, one might contend, can be resisted. Finding out that something
is a time-traveler ought to change our beliefs in, for example,
numerical claims about what exists at a certain time. If you are in
front of what seem to be three dogs at disjoint locations, and you are
told that &lsquo;one of them&rsquo; is a time traveler, present in
front of you at least twice over, then you ought to revisit your
belief about there being three dogs. Indeed, banning perfect
co-location&mdash;which ought to have caused you to revisit the belief
that there are three dogs in the first place&mdash;the scenario is
actually inconsistent with there being three dogs: either there are
two dogs one of which is multilocated at two disjoint regions, or one
dog which is multilocated at three disjoint regions. And, so the
argument continues, what goes for numerical claims goes for
mereological claims. Note that, if one believes that the locational
pattern in
 <a href="#claim1"><strong>Claim 1</strong></a>
 is possible, one will then not have any reason to read off the
mereological structure of occupants from the mereological structure of
their exact locations.</p>

<h4 id="MiniMereMult">6.6.2 Minimal Mereology and Multilocation</h4>

<p>
Effingham and Robson (2007) argue that multilocation is inconsistent
with Minimal Mereology for occupants. To be more precise, it is
inconsistent with the conjunction of the following metaphysical
theses: endurantism, the possibility of time travel, and Weak
Supplementation.</p>

<p>
Effingham and Robson consider a case in which a certain enduring
brick, \(\textit{Brick}_1\), travels backward in time repeatedly, so
that it exists at a certain time, \(t_{100}\), &lsquo;many times
over&rsquo;. At that time there exist what appear to be one hundred
bricks, \(\textit{Brick}_1 \ldots \textit{Brick}_{100}\), though in
fact each of them is identical to \(\textit{Brick}_1\) (on one or
another of its journeys to the time \(t_{100})\), and a bricklayer
arranges &lsquo;them&rsquo; into what appears to be a brick wall,
<em>Wall</em>.</p>

<p>
Given the scenario just described, Effingham and Robson maintain that
we should agree on:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="ex11">(11)</dt>
<dd>\(\textit{Brick}_1\) is numerically identical with
\(\textit{Brick}_{2 (3, &hellip;, 100)}\)</dd>
<dd>\(b_1 = b_2 = \ldots = b_{100}\)</dd>
<dt id="ex12">(12)</dt>
<dd>\(\textit{Brick}_{1 (2, 3, &hellip;, 100)}\) is a proper part of
<em>Wall</em></dd>
<dd>\(\PP(b_1, w), \PP(b_2, w),\ldots, \PP(b_{100}, w)\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
It is easily seen that
 <a href="#ex11">(11)</a>
 and
 <a href="#ex12">(12)</a>
 violate Weak Supplementation in that there is no part of
<em>Wall</em> which is disjoint from \(\textit{Brick}_{1(2, 3, &hellip;,
100)}\).</p>

<p>
Indeed, the scenario envisaged by Effingham and Robson violates almost
every decomposition principle discussed in mereology, including
principles that are strictly weaker than Weak Supplementation, such as
Company, Strong Company, and Quasi Supplementation, the last one under
the assumption that <em>Brick</em> is atomic&mdash;see the entry on
mereology. Be that as it may, the conclusion remains that, given the
possibility of endurantist time travel, multilocation is inconsistent
with Minimal Mereology.</p>

<p>
One possible reaction to this argument is to simply take it as an
argument against endurantism rather than against
multilocation&mdash;as Effingham and Robson themselves do. See Daniels
(2014) for a reply.</p>

<h4 id="GeneRepl">6.6.3 General Replies</h4>

<p>
So far, we have discussed some strategies to resist the arguments
<em>individually</em>. Other things being equal, one should prefer a
more systematic reply that applies to all such cases independently of
(some of) their respective details. We will consider two such general
strategies. First, Smid (2023b) argues that at least <em>some</em>
relevant premises in <em>all</em> the arguments derive their
plausibility <em>solely</em> from controversial principles linking
parthood and location such as:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Strong Partition:</strong> <span class="nonitalic">If
\(x\) is exactly located at a subregion of the exact location of
\(w\), it is part of \(w\)</span> 
\[\forall x\forall y \forall w\forall z [ L(x, y) \land L(w, z) \land P(y, z) \rightarrow P(x, w)]\]
</li>

<li><strong>Strong Proper Partition:</strong> <span class="nonitalic">If
\(x\) is exactly located at a proper subregion of
the exact location of \(w\), it is a proper part of
 \(w\)</span><sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-17" id="ref-17">17</a>]</sup>
 
\[\forall x\forall y \forall w\forall z [L(x, y) \land L(w, z) \land \PP(y, z) \rightarrow \PP(x, w)]\]
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
If he is right, then one can reject these principles and undermine the
arguments against multilocation. Second, one could relativize
mereological claims of parthood. This raises two related
questions:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li id="GRi">If we relativize mereological claims what adicity should
the parthood relation have? Arguably, the leading contenders are that
parthood is a three-place relation, and that parthood is a four-place
relation.</li>

<li id="GRii">What goes in the third and fourth argument slots if we
take parthood to be three or four-place respectively?</li>
</ol>

<p>
Suppose one answers
 <a href="#GRi">(i)</a>
 by claiming that parthood should be three-place. How should we answer
 <a href="#GRii">(ii)</a>?
 &lsquo;Natural&rsquo; candidates include external time, personal
time, the exact location of the part, and the exact location of the
whole. Kleinschmidt (2011) argues that none would work. For the sake
of brevity, we will focus on the case in which one takes parthood to
be a four-place relation (thus answering (i) above) where the two
additional slots are filled by the exact location of the part and the
exact location of whole respectively, thus answering (ii). (This is
the &ldquo;Location Principle&rdquo; below.) This is suggested
independently by both Gilmore (2009) and Kleinschmidt (2011). Gilmore
(2009) provides a more detailed proposal so we will stick to that.
Indeed Gilmore (2009) argues that friends of multilocation have
independent reasons&mdash;reasons having nothing to do with time
travel&mdash;to treat the fundamental parthood relation as a
four-place relation. Let \(P^4(x, y, z, w)\) stand for &ldquo;\(x\) at
\(y\) is part of \(z\) at \(w\)&rdquo;. Then, according to Gilmore,
four-place parthood obeys the following principles:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Location Principle:</strong> <span class="nonitalic">If
\(x\) at \(y\) is a part of \(z\) at \(w\), then: \(x\) is exactly

\[\forall x\forall y\forall z\forall w[P^4 (x, y, z, w)\rightarrow[L(x, y) \amp L(z,w)]]\]

</div>

<p>
It is easy to see how this handles the Minimal Mereology argument. In
effect, Effingham and Robson&rsquo;s scenario simply respects Weak
Supplementation<sub>4P</sub>. Consider the following simplified
representation of the case:</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break" id="fig7">
<img alt="a 2 by 3 box diagram: link to extended description below" src="figure07.svg" style="width:250px" />

<p class="center" id="fig7caption">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 7</span> [An
 <a href="figdesc.html#fig1">extended description of figure 7</a>
 is in the supplement.]</p>
</div>

<p>
Here, <em>Brick</em> at \(r_1\) is a part of <em>Wall</em> at \(r_w\).
Moreover, <em>Brick</em> at \(r_1\) is, in the relevant sense, a
&lsquo;proper part&rsquo; of <em>Wall</em> at \(r_w\), since either
\(\textit{Brick}_1 \ne \textit{Wall}\) or \(r_1 \ne r_w\)&mdash;in
fact, both disjuncts hold. So, we have a case in which <span class="nobr">Weak
Supplementation<sub>4P</sub></span> applies: its
antecedent is satisfied. Accordingly, that principle tells us that
there must be an \(\langle x, r\rangle\) pair such that \(x\) at \(r\)
is a part <em>Wall</em> at \(r_w\) but does not overlap
\(\textit{Brick}_1\) at \(r_1\). One such pair is
\(\langle\textit{Brick}_1, r_3\rangle\): \(\textit{Brick}_1\) at
\(r_3\) is a part of <em>Wall</em> at \(r_w\), but
\(\textit{Brick}_1\) at \(r_3\) does not overlap \(\textit{Brick}_1\)
at \(r_1\). There is no \(\langle x, r\rangle\) pair such that \(x\)
at \(r\) is a part <em>both</em> of \(\textit{Brick}_1\) at \(r_1\)
<em>and</em> of \(\textit{Brick}_1\) at \(r_3\). Hence the consequent
is satisfied as well.</p>

<p>
What about the Ground Mereology argument? Gilmore (2009) does not
discuss this case. However, the four-place notion of parthood might be
helpful here as well, even if things are a little less
straightforward. Once proper parthood is defined (and a lot might hang
on this definition), plausibly the four-place counterparts of
Transitivity and Asymmetry of Proper Parthood are given by:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Proper Parthood Transitivity<sub>4P</sub>:</strong> <span class="nonitalic">
If \(x_1\) at \(x_2\) is a proper part of y\(_1\)
at y\(_2\) and y\(_1\) at y\(_2\) is a proper part of \(z_1\) at

\(z_2\).</span> 
\[ \begin{multline}

 \amp \PP^4 (y_1, y_2, z_1, z_2)] \rightarrow \PP^4 (x_1, x_2, z_1, z_2)] 
\end{multline} \]
</li>

<li><strong>Proper Parthood Asymmetry<sub>4P</sub>:</strong> <span class="nonitalic">
If \(x_1\) at \(x_2\) is a proper part of \(y_1\)
at \(y_2\), then \(y_1\) at \(y_2\) is not a proper part of \(x_1\) at

\[(\forall x_1\forall x_2\forall y_1\forall y_2 [\PP^4 (x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2) \rightarrow \neg(\PP^4 (y_1, y_2, x_1, x_2)]\]
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Now, go back to Kleinschmidt (2011) case, and to
 <a href="#claim1"><strong>Claim 1</strong></a>
 in
 <a href="#GrouMereMult">Section 6.6.1</a>.
 Clearly \(x_1 = z_1 =\) <em>Clifford</em> = <em>Odie</em>, \(x_2 =
r_3, y_1 =\) <em>Kibble</em>, \(y_2 = r_2\), and, finally, \(z_2 =
r_1\). Consider Asymmetry first. There we have that</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li><em>Kibble</em> at \(r_2\) is a proper part of <em>Clifford</em>
at \(r_3\), and</li>

<li><em>Odie</em> at \(r_1\) is a proper part of <em>Kibble</em> at
\(r_2\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
But, plausibly, we have that neither</p>

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li><em>Clifford</em> at \(r_3\) is a proper part of <em>Kibble</em>
at \(r_2\), nor that</li>

<li><em>Kibble</em> at \(r_2\) is a proper part of <em>Odie</em> at
\(r_1\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
At first sight the notion of four-place parthood can handle the
violation of Asymmetry in the Kleinschmidt&rsquo;s case.</p>

<p>
What about transitivity? In that case we have that</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li><em>Odie</em> at \(r_1\) is a proper part of <em>Kibble</em> at
\(r_2\), and</li>

<li><em>Kibble</em> at \(r_2\) is a proper part of <em>Clifford</em>
at \(r_3\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Transitivity<sub>4P</sub> yields that</p>

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li><em>Odie</em> at \(r_1\) is a proper part of <em>Clifford</em> at
\(r_3\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Note that this does not violate the 4-place counterpart of
Irreflexivity of Proper Parthood, which is, arguably:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Proper Parthood Irreflexivity<sub>4P</sub>:</strong> <span class="nonitalic">If
\(x\) is exactly located at \(y\), then \(x\) at
\(y\) is not a proper part of \(x\) at \(y\).</span> 
\[\forall x\forall y[L(x, y)\rightarrow \neg \PP^4 (x, y, x, y)]\]
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Thus, one may argue that at first sight the notion of four-place
parthood can handle the violation of Transitivity as well. It should
be noted however that the success or failure of the arguments above
crucially depend on the interaction of four-place parthood with
identity. For example, the Asymmetry argument depends upon whether one
can plausibly deny that <em>Clifford</em> at \(r_3\) is identical to
<em>Odie</em> at \(r_1\). And the Transitivity argument depends upon
whether one can plausibly deny the following: if \(x\) at \(r_1\) is a
proper part of \(x\) at \(r_2\) (with \(r_{1} \neq r_{2}\) ), then \(x
\neq x\).</p>

<h2 id="SupeHarm">7. Supersubstantivalism and Harmony</h2>

<p>
As we noted in
 <a href="#IntePart">Section 3</a>,
 a particular metaphysical thesis, <em>supersubstantivalism</em>,
roughly the view that material objects are <em>identical</em> to their
exact locations, entails full blown mereological harmony.</p>

<p>
It is both interesting and important to distinguish two versions of
<em>Supersubstantivalism</em>. <em>Restricted
Supersubstantivalism</em> only subscribes to <em>Sup-Sub 1</em> below,
whereas <em>Unrestricted Supersubstantivalism</em> maintains both
<em>Sup-Sub 1</em> and <em>Sup-Sub 2</em>&mdash;the terminology is due
to Schaffer (2009).</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li><em>Sup-Sub 1</em>: Necessarily, for every material object \(x,
x\) is exactly located at \(r\) iff \(x = r\).</li>

<li><em>Sup-Sub 2</em>: Necessarily, for every region \(r\), there is
a material object \(o\) such that \(o\) is exactly located at \(r\)
iff \(o = r\).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
The first version is called <em>Restricted Supersubstantivalism</em>
because it is compatible with there being a <em>restriction</em> on
which regions can be identified with material objects. For instance,
one can maintain that empty regions should not be identified with
material objects, or regions with a given dimensionality should not be
identified with material objects (e.g., regions that are
four-dimensional cannot be the exact locations of objects, say because
one endorses some variant of endurantism&mdash;see, e.g., Nolan
2014).</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li>(<em>Unrestricted</em>) <em>Supersubstantivalism</em> entails:
<br />
<em>Perfect Harmony:</em> For any mereological predicate \(P, x\) is
\(P\) iff <span class="nw">\(x\)&rsquo;s</span> exact location is
\(P\).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
One obtains H1&ndash;H8 in
 <a href="#IntePart">Section 3</a>,
 by substituting the relevant predicates for \(P\) in <em>Perfect
Harmony.</em> Let us see the arguments for the four cases we
discussed.</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Interpenetration.</strong> <em>Supersubstantivalism</em>
entails
 <a href="#Prin_nointerpenetration">No Interpenetration</a>.
 Assume the antecedent, i.e., suppose \(L(x, z), L(y, w)\), and \(O(z
,w)\). By <em>Sup-Sub 1</em>, \(x = z\), and \(y = w\). Therefore
\(O(x, y)\), which is the consequent.</li>

<li><strong>Extended Simples.</strong> <em>Supersubstantivalism</em>
entails No Extended Simples. Assume the antecedent, i.e., suppose
\(L(x, y)\), and \(y\) is complex, \(C(y)\). By <em>Sup-Sub 1</em>,
\(x = y\), and therefore \(C(x)\), which is the consequent. The
argument for <strong>No Unextended Complexes</strong> is exactly
parallel.</li>

<li><strong>Multilocation.</strong> <em>Supersubstantivalism</em>
entails there cannot be &ldquo;object multilocation&rdquo;. For
reductio, suppose an object \(x\) is multilocated, that is, exactly
located at least at two <em>distinct</em> regions \(y\) and \(w\).
Then by <em>Sup-Sub 1</em>, \(x = y\) and \(x = w\). By symmetry and
transitivity of identity, \(y = w\). Contradiction.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2 id="FurtIssu">8. Further Issues</h2>

<p>
We conclude by listing some important issues about which we have so
far said little. These include&mdash;but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>

<li>the interaction of parthood and location with other notions such
as

<ul>

<li><em>topological connection</em> (Cartwright 1975; Hudson 2005;

<li><em>vagueness and indeterminacy</em> (McKinnon 2003; Hawley 2004;
N. Smith 2005; Donnelly 2009; Barnes &amp; Williams 2011; Carmichael

</ul> </li>

<li>questions about

<ul>

<li><em>locational pluralism</em> (Fine 2006; Leonard 2014;

<li><em>topic neutrality</em> of location (Simons 2004a,b; Cowling
2014b; Gilmore 2014a);</li>
</ul> </li>

<li>applications to particular domains such as

<ul>

<li><em>social</em> (Effingham 2010; Hindriks 2013) and</li>

<li><em>personal ontology</em> (Lowe 1996, 2000, 2001; Olson
1998);</li>

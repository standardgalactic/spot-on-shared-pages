<p>
This entry discusses the use of mathematical languages to express and
analyze the formal properties of power in games. The mathematical
languages discussed in this entry will be referred to as

<p>
The material in this entry will be limited to the logical analysis of

game theory to study logical languages nor the role of epistemic

sequential decisions-making, typical of strategic reasoning in
extensive games. An account of those can be found in the related

<h2 id="LogiUndeNormFormGame">1. The Logic Underneath Games</h2>

<p>
A <strong>game</strong> is a mathematical description of the relation
between a set of <strong>individuals</strong> (or groups of
individuals) and a set of potential <strong>outcomes</strong>.
Individuals choose, <strong>independently and concurrently</strong>, a
subset of the outcomes, with the final outcome being selected from the
combination of each choice. <em>Independently</em> means that
individuals&rsquo; choices do not influence one another.
<em>Concurrently</em> means that each individual&rsquo;s choices are
taken not knowing the other players&rsquo; choices. Each individual is
assumed to have a preference over the set of outcomes, i.e., he or she
likes some outcomes more than others, and typically assumed to know
the other individuals&rsquo; potential choices and preferences,
adjusting their decisions accordingly.</p>

<p>
Games are used to model all sorts of situations, ranging from animal
behavior to international conflict resolution (Osborne &amp;
Rubinstein 1994). A useful application for the purpose of this entry
is collective decision-making, an instance of which is going to be the
working example throughout.</p>

<div class="indent" id="example1">

<p>
<strong>Example 1 (The treaty of Rome).</strong> The treaty of Rome
(1958&ndash;1973) established the European Economic Community.
According to Article 148 of the Treaty, acts of the Council (one of
the main legislative institutions) required for their adoption:</p>

<ul>

<li>12 votes (if the act was proposed by the Commission), or</li>

<li>12 votes by at least 4 member states (if the act was not proposed
by the Commission).</li>
</ul>

<p>
The values above refer to the EU-6, the founding member states. The
treaty allocated the votes as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>4 votes: France, Germany, Italy;</li>

<li>2 votes: Belgium, The Netherlands;</li>

<li>1 vote: Luxembourg.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This scenario can be described as a game.</p>

<p>
There are six players, the Countries:
<br />
France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg.</p>

<p>
They vote on one issue at the time. Issues can be binary, e.g., the
adoption of a border-protection scheme, or multi-valued, e.g., how
many millions should be spent on the adoption of a border-protection
scheme.</p>

<p>
Countries might have <em>preferences</em> over the outcome of the vote
or even over the other Countries&rsquo; specific vote, and they
usually vote without <em>knowing</em> how the others have voted.</p>

<p>
Often times, these games are such that no participant is, alone,
capable of deciding the final outcome, but, in some cases, they could
cooperate and agree on a <em>joint strategy</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>
Depending on players&rsquo; preferences, knowledge and capabilities
some outcomes will be more likely to be chosen. In order to understand
which ones, game theory has devised solution concepts, formally
functions from the set of games to the set of outcomes in each of
these games, which describe players&rsquo; rationality in mathematical
terms. Solution concepts, as we will see later, can be succinctly
expressed in simple and well-behaved logics.</p>

<p>
Next we describe games as mathematical structures, emphasizing various
key ingredients (e.g., the possibility of forming coalitions, the
possibility to take decisions in time etc.) and the best suited
languages to express them.</p>

<h2 id="BasiIngr">2. The Basic Ingredients</h2>

<p>
Formally, games consist of a finite set of players \(N=\{1,2, \ldots,
n\}\) and a possibly infinite set of outcomes \(W=\{w_1, w_2, \ldots,
w_k, \ldots \}\).</p>

<p class="indent" id="example2">
<strong>Example 2.</strong> In the example above the set of players
<em>N</em> is {France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, The Netherlands,
Luxembourg}. If we consider the issue <span class="fw small">adoption
of border-protection scheme</span>, there are two outcomes: yes and
no, i.e., \(W = \{\mbox{yes, no}\}\). If we instead consider the issue
<span class="fw small">millions spent on border-protection
scheme</span> there is a potentially infinite outcome space, i.e., \(W
= \{\textrm{0M}, \textrm{1M}, \textrm{2M}, \ldots \}\). It is possible
to have a set of outcomes that is even refined further, for instance
specifying the way players have voted. In this case the outcome in
which France votes yes, the others vote no, and the result is no,
would be different from the outcome in which Italy votes yes, the
others vote no, and the result is no, although the result of the vote
is the same. What is important to emphasize is that each set of
outcomes comes with a <em>level of description</em> of what is
happening in the underlying interaction. There is no a priori right or
wrong level of description, the choice depends on the properties of
the game that one is interested in.</p>

<p>
On top of players and outcomes, games come with two more
relations:</p>

<ul>

<li>a <strong>preference relation</strong>, denoted \(\succeq\),
describing players&rsquo; preferences over outcomes;</li>

<li>an <strong>action relation</strong>, denoted \(E\), describing the
outcomes that players or groups of players are able to impose or,
conversely, rule out;</li>
</ul>

<p>
An important relation in games is knowledge, which formally describes
what players know of the game and their opponents. This relation is
sometimes given explicitly, other times left implicit. The present
entry will not make the relation explicit, but will rather incorporate
it in the formalization of players&rsquo; rationality.</p>

<p>
Both the preference and the action relations collect families of
individual relations, one per player. The preference relation, for
instance, is broken down into a family \(\{\succeq_i\}_{i\in N}\),
describing the preference over outcomes for each of the individuals,
while the action relation collects a family \(\{E_C\}_{C\subseteq N}\)
each describing what a specific group of players can achieve.</p>

<p>
Overall, a game can be seen as a mathematical structure</p>

\[(\mathcal{N}, W, \succeq, E)\]

<p>
where \(\mathcal{N}\) is the set of players, typically finite, \(W\)
the set of outcomes, \(\succeq\) the preference relation and \(E\) the
action relation.</p>

<p>
This mathematical structure is also known as a <strong>relational
structure</strong> (Blackburn, Rijke, &amp; Venema 2001), which (in a
certain sense) is a set-theoretic equivalent of a so-called
<strong>modal logic</strong> (Blackburn <em>et al</em>. 2001), a
mathematical language that is well-suited to express the mathematical
properties of relations. A relational structure will henceforth be
denoted \(F\), which stands for <strong>frame</strong>.</p>

<p>
The last ingredient that we need, in order to link relational
structures and modal logics, is the specification of a set of atomic
propositions <span class="fw small">Atoms</span>, which expresses the
relevant properties of the outcomes we are interested in. This set is
usually taken to be
 countable<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 and is associated to outcomes by means of a <strong>valuation
function</strong>, i.e., a function of the form</p> 
\[V: W \to 2^\texttt{Atoms}\]

<p>
associating to each outcome the set of propositional atoms that are
true at that outcome.</p>

<p>
A tuple \((F,V)\) will be referred to as <strong>model</strong>, which
will be denoted \(M\).</p>

<p>
The relations in a game structure, which are relative to individual
players (and groups), will formally be described in connection with
the main modal logics used to express their properties, at different
levels of description and granularity.</p>

<p>
The following paragraph collects the background technical notions
needed to interpret the modal languages used in this entry. The reader
already acquainted with modal logic can skip it. For a more in depth
exploration one can consult the related entry on
 <a href="../logic-modal/">modal logic</a>.
 Well-known classic textbooks are <em>Modal Logic: An
Introduction</em> (Chellas 1980), which focuses on non-normal modal
logics, and <em>Modal Logic</em> (Blackburn <em>et al</em>. 2001),
which focuses instead on a more mathematical treatment of normal modal
 logics.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup></p>
 
<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Modal Logic: background notions:</strong> The language of a
<strong>modal logic</strong> is an extension of the language of
propositional logic with a set of modal operators \(\Box_1,\ldots ,
\Box_n, \ldots\), defined on a countable set of atomic propositions
\(\texttt{Atoms}=\{p_1,p_2, \ldots \}\), over which the set of
<em>well-formed formulas</em> is inductively built (for a mathematical
treatment of logic and induction see for instance Dalen 1980). Each
well-formed formula \(\varphi\) of a modal language \(\mathcal{L}\),
henceforth simply called <em>formula</em>, is constructed using the
following grammar:</p> 
\[\varphi ::= p \mid \lnot\varphi\mid\varphi \wedge \varphi \mid \Box_i \varphi\]

<p>
where \(\Box_i \in \{\Box_1, \ldots, \Box_n, \ldots\}\) and \(p \in
\texttt{Atoms}\).</p>
</div>

<p>
A model for this language is a structure \(M = ((W, R_1, \ldots, R_n,
\ldots), V)\), consisting of a set of <strong>worlds</strong> or
<strong>states</strong> or <strong>outcomes</strong> \(W\); an
<strong>accessibility relation</strong> \(R_i\) for each modal
operator \(\Box_i\)which we here assume are so-called neighborhood
functions (Chellas 1980), i.e., functions \(R_i: W \to 2^{2^{W}}\);
and a <strong>valuation function</strong> \(V: \texttt{Atoms} \to
2^{W}\), which assigns to each atomic proposition a subset of \(W\),
with the idea that each atomic proposition is assigned to the set of
worlds at which this proposition is true.</p>

<p>
As a general convention, a multimodal language with modalities
\(\Box_1\), &hellip;, \(\Box_n\), &hellip; will be denoted by
\(\mathcal{L}^{f(\Box_1),\ldots, f(\Box_n),\ldots}\), where the
function \(f\) associates to each modality its intuitive shorthand.
Let \(\Delta\) be a modal language with modalities \(\Box_1\),
&hellip;, \(\Box_n\), &hellip; and let \(M = ((W, R_1, \ldots, R_n,
\ldots), V )\) be a model for this language. The <strong>satisfaction
relation</strong> of a formula \(\varphi \in \Delta\) with respect to
a pair \((M,w)\), where \(w \in W\), is defined according to the
following truth conditions:</p> 
\[\begin{align*}
M,w&amp;\models p &amp;\mbox{ if and only if }&amp; w \in V(p)\\
 M,w&amp;\models \neg\varphi &amp;\mbox{ if and only if }&amp; M,w\not\models\varphi \\
 M,w&amp;\models \varphi\land\psi &amp;\mbox{ if and only if }&amp; M,w\models\varphi \mbox{ and } M,w\models\psi \\
 M,w&amp;\models \Box_i \varphi &amp;\mbox{ if and only if }&amp; \varphi^M\in R_i(w) \\
 
\end{align*} \]

<p>
where \(\varphi^{M}=\{w \in W \mid M,w \models \varphi\}\) is called
the <strong>truth set</strong> or the <strong>extension</strong> of
\(\varphi\).</p>

<p>
A formula \(\varphi\) of a modal language: <strong>holds at a
state</strong> \(w\) of model \(M\) whenever \(M,w \models \varphi\);
is <strong>valid in a model</strong> \(M\), denoted \(\models_{M}
\varphi\), if and only if \(M,w \models \varphi\) for every \(w \in
W\), where \(W\) is the domain of \(M\); is <strong>valid in a class
of models</strong> \(\mathcal{M}\), denoted \(\models_{\mathcal{M}}
\varphi\), if and only if it is valid in every \(M \in \mathcal{M}\);
is <strong>valid in a frame</strong> \({F}\) (a model without a
valuation function), denoted \(\models_{{F}} \varphi\), if and only if
for every valuation \(V\) we have that \(\models_{(F,V)} \varphi\); is
<strong>valid in a class of frames</strong> \(\mathcal{F}\), denoted
\(\models_{\mathcal{F}} \varphi\), if and only if it is valid in every
\(F \in \mathcal{F}\).</p>

<p>
We can view a <em>modal logic</em> as the set of formulas
\(\Delta_{\mathcal{M}}\)(\(\Delta_{\mathcal{F}}\)) that are valid in a
given class of models \(\mathcal{M}\) (frames \(\mathcal{F}\)). For a
set of formulas \(\Sigma\), we write \(M,w \models \Sigma\) to say
that \(M,w \models \sigma\), for all \(\sigma\in \Sigma\). We say that
a set of formulas (globally) <strong>semantically entails</strong> a
formula \(\varphi\) in a class of models \(\mathcal{M}\), denoted
\(\Sigma \models_{\mathcal{M}} \varphi\), if for every \(M \in
\mathcal{M}\)we have that \(\models_{M} \Sigma\) implies \(\models_{M}
\varphi\). When \(\mathcal{F}\) is a class of frames, \(\Sigma
\models_{\mathcal{F}} \phi\) means that \(\Sigma \models_{\mathcal{M}}
\phi\) where \(\mathcal{M}\) is the set of models based on frames in
\(\mathcal{F}\).</p>

<p>
A modal rule</p> 
\[\frac{\varphi_1,\ldots ,\varphi_n }{\psi}\]

<p>
is <strong>sound</strong> in a class of models \(\mathcal{M}\) if
\(\varphi_1,\ldots ,\varphi_n \models_{\mathcal{M}} \psi\).</p>

<p>
Recall, following Chellas (1980), that a modal logic \(\Delta\) is
called <strong>classical</strong> if it is closed under the rule of
equivalence, i.e., for each \(\Box\) in the language we have:</p>

\[\frac{\varphi \leftrightarrow \psi}{\Box \varphi \leftrightarrow \Box \psi}\]

<p>
It is called <strong>monotonic</strong> if it is classical and it is
moreover closed under the rule of monotonicity, i.e., for each
\(\Box\) in the language we have:</p> 
\[\frac{\varphi \rightarrow \psi}{\Box \varphi \rightarrow \Box \psi}\]

<p>
It is called <strong>normal</strong> if it is monotonic, it is closed
under the rule of generalization and contains the \(K\) axiom, i.e.,
for each \(\Box\) we have</p> 
\[\frac{\varphi}{\Box \varphi}\]

<p>
and \(\Delta\) contains all instances of \(\Box(\varphi \to \psi) \to
(\Box \varphi \to \Box \psi)\).</p>

<p>
When \( R_i\) is a principal
 filter<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]
 </sup>, we say that we say that the modality \(\Box_i\) is
<em>normal</em>. In that case \(R_i\)can equivalently be represented
as a relation of the form \(R_i: W \to 2^{W}\), and then we have that
\(M,w \models \Box_i \phi\) if and only if \(M,v \models \phi\) for
all \(v \in W\) such that \(wR_iv\). A <em>normal modal logic</em> can
be interpreted in structures of the form \(M = ((W, R'_1, \ldots,
R'_n, \ldots), V)\)where every \(R'_i\) is a principal filter.</p>

<h3 id="Pref">2.1 Preferences</h3>

<p>
Recall the relational structure \((\mathcal{N},W, \succeq, E)\) and
consider the relation \(\succeq\). This relation compactly represents
a family \(\{\succeq_i\}_{i\in N}\) of individual preference relations
each indexed with a player.</p>

<p>
Formally, a <strong>preference</strong> for player \(i\) is a
relation</p> 
\[\succeq_i \subseteq W \times W\]

<p>
The idea is that if two outcomes \(w\) and \(w'\) are such that
\((w,w')\in \succeq_i\) then player \(i\) considers outcome \(w\) at
least as good as outcome \(w'\). The fact that \((w,w')\in \succeq_i\)
will be abbreviated \(w \succeq_i w'\). Its inverse is the relation
\(\preceq_i\),which holds for \((w,w')\) whenever \(w' \succeq_i w\).
Its strict counterpart is the relation \(\succ_i\), which holds for
\((w,w')\) whenever \(w \succeq_i w'\) and it is not the case that
\(w' \succeq_i w\). Moreover \(w \sim_i w'\) denotes the fact that \(w
\succeq_i w'\) and \(w' \succeq_i w\), meaning that \(i\) is
indifferent between \(w\) and \(w'\).</p>

<p class="indent" id="example3">
<strong>Example 3.</strong> Let us go back to our main example.
Typically Countries have preferences over the outcome of the decision,
e.g., Italy think we should spend between 5 and 10 million euros for
the scheme, Germany think we should spend between 1 and 2, Belgium
between 4 and 5, Luxembourg, The Netherlands and France exactly 5.
This means, for instance, that Italy&rsquo;s preference relation is
such that \(w \succ_{\textrm{Italy}} w'\) whenever \(\textrm{5M} \leq
w \leq \textrm{10M}\) and either \(w'&gt;\textrm{10M}\) or \(0\leq
w'&lt;\textrm{5M}\). What about all other couples of outcomes? In the
simplest case Italy are indifferent between them. So \(w
\sim_{\textrm{Italy}} w'\), otherwise. However, we could also assume a
more complex preference. For instance, Italy would like to spend as
much money as possible within their desired budget. In this case the
preference relation is: \(w \succ_{\textrm{Italy}} w'\) whenever
\(\textrm{5M} \leq w \leq \textrm{10M}\) and either
\(w'&gt;\textrm{10M}\) or \(0\leq w'&lt;\textrm{5M}\), \(w
\succ_{\textrm{Italy}} w'\) whenever \(\textrm{5M} \leq w' &lt; w \leq
\textrm{10M}\) while \(w \sim_{\textrm{Italy}} w'\), otherwise. Not
all outcomes of a vote are going to reach an agreement. We then, for
technical purposes, define an auxiliary outcome \(w^{*}\), interpreted
as a disagreement outcome. The idea is that this is an outcome of the
vote that does not reach any consensus. We assume that any agreement
is strictly better for any player than disagreement, i.e., \(w
\succ_{{i}} w'\) whenever \(w'=w^{*}\) and \(w\neq w^{*}\), for each
\(i\in N\).</p>

<p>
Properties of these relations can be expressed by means of modal
logics. To do so we introduce modal operators
\(\Diamond^{\preceq}_i\), \(\Diamond^{\prec}_i\) and
\(\Diamond^{\sim}_i\) for each of the corresponding relations, and we
can view a relational structure as a modal logic frame with the
relation \(\preceq_i\) interpreting \(\Diamond^{\preceq}_i\) and so
on.</p>

<p>
The interpretation in a model \(M\) based on such a frame, for \(R \in
\{\preceq, \prec, \sim\}\), is then as follows (note that these
modalities are normal):</p> 
\[ M,w \models \Diamond^{R}_i \varphi\enskip \mbox{ if and only if }\enskip M,w^{\prime} \models \varphi, \mbox{ for some } w^{\prime} \mbox{ with } w R_i w^{\prime}\]

<p>
The relations in question often come with extra properties. For
instance, \(\preceq_i\) is usually taken to satisfy the following:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>reflexivity</strong>: i.e., \(\forall w\in W, i \in N,\)
we have that: \(w \preceq_i w\);</li>

<li><strong>transitivity</strong>: i.e., \(\forall w_1, w_2, w_3 \in
W, i \in N,\) we have that: (\(w_1 \preceq_i w_2\) and \(w_2 \preceq_i
w_3\)) implies that \(w_1 \preceq_i w_3\).</li>

<li><strong>connectedness</strong>: i.e., \(\forall w_1, w_2 \in W, i
\in N,\) we have that: either \(w_1 \preceq_1 w_2\) or \(w_2 \preceq_i
w_1\).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
The first two properties can be characterized by means of the
following axioms and validities.</p>

<div class="indent avoid-break" id="prop1">
<strong>Proposition 1.</strong> 
\[\begin{align*}
\models_F \varphi &amp;\rightarrow \Diamond^{\preceq}_i \varphi &amp;\mbox{ if and only if }&amp; \preceq_i \mbox{ is reflexive} \\
 \models_F \Diamond^{\preceq}_i\Diamond^{\preceq}_i\varphi &amp;\rightarrow \Diamond^{\preceq}_i \varphi &amp;\mbox{ if and only if }&amp; \preceq_i \mbox{ is transitive} 
\end{align*}\]

</div>

<p>
However this is not the case for connectedness, as modal languages
such as this one can only talk about <em>local</em> properties of
relations (Blackburn <em>et al</em>. 2001).</p>

<p>
To characterize connectedness we need to introduce a special type of
operator: the universal (or global) modality (Goranko &amp; Passy
1992). This modality expresses properties of all the states in a
domain \(W\) of a model \(M\) and it is interpreted as follows.</p>

\[ M,w \models A\varphi \enskip\mbox{ if and only if }\enskip M,w^{\prime} \models \varphi, \mbox{ for all } w^{\prime} \in W\]

<p>
The formula \(\neg A \neg \varphi\) will be abbreviated \(E\varphi\).
The symbol \(E\) is the existential dual of \(A\) and it indicates
that a certain formula holds at some state in the model. With the
global modality we have a genuine addition of expressivity (together
with further costs and further gains, as shown in Goranko &amp; Passy
1992), therefore we can express validity in a model by means of
expressing truth in a world, witness the fact that \(M,w \models A
\varphi\) holds if and only if \( \models_M \varphi\) does.</p>

<p>
Recall that a relation \(R\) is trichotomous if and only if for all
\(x,y\in W\) it is either the case that \(xRy, yRx\) or \(y=x\). We
can use a combination of preference and global modalities to obtain
the following frame correspondence.</p>

<div class="indent" id="prop2">

<p>
<strong>Proposition 2.</strong> Let \(F\) be a frame. We have
that:</p>

<p class="indent">
\(\models_F (\varphi \wedge \Box^{\preceq}_i \psi) \to A(\psi \vee
\varphi \vee \Diamond^{\preceq}_i \varphi)\) if and only if
\(\preceq_i\) is trichotomous</p>
</div>

<p>
An alternative and possibly more intuitive formula that can be used
instead is, for \(p,q\) being atomic propositions:</p> 
\[E p \land E q \to E(p \land q) \lor E(p \land \Diamond^{\preceq}_i q) \lor E(q \land \Diamond^{\preceq}_i p)\]

<p>
Trichotomy, transitivity and reflexivity of \(\preceq_i\) are
equivalent to the relation being a weak linear order, and thus being
connected.</p>

<p>
The relation \(\prec_i\), i.e., the relation of strict preference, can
be defined in terms of \(\preceq_i\). But \(\prec_i\) satisfies the
following property:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>irreflexivity</strong>: i.e., \(\forall w\in W, i \in N,\)
we have that: it is not the case that \(w \prec_i w\);</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Irreflexivity is not definable in basic modal logic (Blackburn <em>et
al</em>. 2001). However if the atomic propositions are powerful enough
to tell each outcome apart, then irreflexivity becomes definable. For
instance let \(w_k\) be a variable identifying world
 \(w_k\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 We have the following.</p>

<div class="indent" id="prop3">
<strong>Proposition 3.</strong> 
\[\models_F w_k \to \neg \Diamond^\prec_i w_k \enskip\mbox{ if and only if }\enskip \prec_i \mbox{ is irreflexive} \]

</div>

<p>
Finally, the indifference relation \(\sim\) satisfies the properties
of reflexivity, transitivity and symmetry. While reflexivity and
transitivity are defined analogously to the previous modalities,
symmetry is defined as follows.</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>symmetry</strong>: i.e., \(\forall w_1, w_2 \in W, i \in
N,\) we have that: \(w_1 \sim_i w_2\) implies that \(w_2 \sim_i
w_1\).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
While the axioms for the first two are similar to the ones for
\(\preceq_i\), symmetry is characterized as follows</p>

<div class="indent" id="prop4">
<strong>Proposition 4.</strong> 
\[\models_F (\psi \to \Box^{\sim}_i \Diamond^{\sim}_i\psi) \enskip\mbox{ if and only if }\enskip \sim_i \mbox{ is symmetric} \]

</div>

<p>
The three properties above say, together, that each \(\sim_i\) is
mathematically an <strong>equivalence relation</strong>, i.e., a
relation such that</p> 
\[\bigcup_{w \in W} \{[w] \mid w' \in [w] \mbox{ whenever } w \sim_i w' \}\]

<p>
is a partition of \(W\). Each element of this partition is an
<strong>indifference class</strong> for player \(i\), i.e., a set of
outcomes he or she is indifferent to.</p>

<p>
The logic of equivalence relations, such as \(\sim_i\), is also known
as the \({\bf S5}\) system.</p>

<p>
<strong>Preferences and utilities</strong>: Because of their
widespread use in game theory, an important class of preference
relations are those that <em>correspond</em> to numerical values, or
utility functions.</p>

<p>
A <strong>utility function</strong> is a function</p> 
\[u_i: W \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\]

<p>
mapping outcomes to real numbers, representing <em>how much</em> a
player values a certain state.</p>

<p>
Utility functions naturally induce preference relations, in the
following sense.</p>

<div class="indent" id="def5">

<p>
<strong>Definition 5.</strong> Let \(u\) be a utility function. We say
that \(\succeq^*_i\) <strong>corresponds to</strong> \(u\) if the
following holds:</p> 
\[w \succeq^*_i w' \enskip\textrm{ if and only if }\enskip u_i(w) \geq u_i(w')\]

</div>

<p>
Notice how every weak linear order over a finite set of outcomes
corresponds to some utility function.</p>

<h3 id="Choi">2.2 Choices</h3>

<p>
A game is also a description of what players can achieve, on their own
or within coalitions. To formalize this we use effectivity functions,
an abstract model of power introduced to study voting strategies in
committees (Moulin &amp; Peleg 1982).</p>

<p>
An <strong>effectivity function</strong> (Moulin &amp; Peleg 1982) is
a function</p> 
\[E:2^{N} \to 2^{2^{W}}\]

<p>
associating to each group of players a set of sets of outcomes.</p>

<p>
The idea is that, whenever it is the case that \(X\in E(C)\), then
coalition \(C\) is able to decide that the outcome of the game lies
inside the set \(X\), and can therefore rule out the outcomes \(W
\setminus X\) from being eventually chosen. In other words \(X\) is
<em>within the power</em> of coalition \(C\).</p>

<p>
Effectivity functions of games are <strong>closed under
supersets</strong>, i.e., we have that \(X\in E(C)\) and \(X\subseteq
Y \subseteq W\) imply that \(Y \in E(C)\). In other words, if \(X\) is
within the power of coalition \(C\) then so is each of \(X\)&rsquo;s
supersets. From this, notice, it follows that if an effectivity
function of a certain coalition is not empty then it always contains
the set of all outcomes.
<br />
For \(\mathcal{X} \subseteq {2^{W}}\) we denote \(\mathcal{X}^{+}\)
its superset closure.</p>

<div class="indent" id="example4">

<p>
<strong>Example 4.</strong> Going back to the main example, consider
the power of each individual country. Because of the rules of the
game, no country is alone in position to rule out any outcome.</p>

<p>
Resorting to effectivity functions: for each \(i\in N\), we have that
\(E(\{i\}) = \{W\}\).</p>

<p>
This is however also the case for coalitions that are not big enough.
For instance, take all coalitions of at least two Countries that can
be formed between The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.</p>

\[\begin{align*}
E(\{\mbox{Luxembourg, Belgium}\}) &amp;= \\
 E(\{\mbox{Luxembourg, The Netherlands}\}) &amp;= \\
 E(\{\mbox{Belgium, The Netherlands}\}) &amp;= \\
 E(\{\mbox{Luxembourg, Belgium, The Netherlands}\}) &amp;= \{W\}. 
\end{align*} \]

<p>
Because their total weight sums to at most to 5 votes, they are not,
on their own, able to settle for or rule out any possible agreement.
In fact, for acts proposed by the Commission, each coalition \(C\)
whose voting weight is not at least 12 has the same effectivity
function \(E(C) = \{W\}\).</p>

<p>
For the other coalitions, the situation is different. Consider for
instance the coalition made by France, Germany and Italy, which,
together, have a voting weight of 12. For them we have that:</p>

\[E(\{\textrm{France, Germany, Italy}\}) = \{\{w\} \mid w \in W\}^{+}\]

<p>
This means that the three members can, on their own, decide the
outcome of the vote. This is true for every coalition of voting weight
12 or more.</p>

<p>
What about the acts not proposed by the Commission? For them let us
use a different effectivity function, which we label \(E^{*}\).</p>

<p>
In this case the winning coalition has to consist of at least four
members.</p>

<p>
So \(E^{*}(\{\mbox{France, Germany, Italy}\}) = \{W\}\) while
\(E^{*}(\{\)France, Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands\(\}) = \{\{w\}
\mid w \in W\}^{+}\).</p>

<p>
In general, it holds that \(E(C)=E^{*}(C)\) whenever \(|C|\geq 4\).
Because of the properties of the voting game, we also have that
\(E(C)=E^{*}(C)\) whenever \(|C|\leq 2\). The difference is made by
coalitions of size 3: with \(E^{*}\), they can never achieve more than
\(\{W\}\), while with \(E\) they can achieve \(\{\{w\} \mid w \in
W\}^{+}\), if their voting power is at least 12. Notice that
Luxembourg is irrelevant when it comes to bills proposed by the
Commission, i.e., \(E(C) = E(C \cup \textrm{ Luxembourg})\). This is
not the case for the other bills, as we have observed.</p>
</div>

<p>
Properties of effectivity functions can be expressed in modal logic.
To do so it is important to observe that a <em>dynamic</em>
effectivity function, essentially an effectivity function in each
state of the model, corresponds to a (non-normal) relation in a
relational structure. So what effectivity functions do is to induce a
special kind of neighborhood structure, which we refer to as
<em>Coalition Model</em>.</p>

<div class="indent" id="def6">

<p>
<strong>Definition 6 [Coalition Models].</strong> A <em>Coalition
Model</em> is a triple \((W,E, V)\) where:</p>

<ul>

<li>\(W\) is a nonempty set of states;</li>

<li>\(E: W \longrightarrow (2^{N} \longrightarrow 2^{2^W})\) is a
<em>dynamic</em> effectivity function;</li>

<li>\(V: W \longrightarrow 2^{\texttt{Atoms}}\) is a valuation
function.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
A <em>coalition frame</em> is a model without the valuation function.
Coalition models are, of course, relational game structures in
disguise. As the reader will notice, dynamic effectivity functions
allow each state to possibly have different power distributions among
coalitions. This is <em>strictu sensu</em> irrelevant for the
treatment of power in games
 (<a href="#AnalPowe">Section 3</a>),
 where the effectivity functions associated to outcomes could as well
be taken to be equivalent everywhere in the model, but the model is
general enough to treat extensive and repeated interaction, where the
sequential structure of the interaction is defined explicitly. We will
usually abbreviate \(E(w)(C)\) as \(E_w(C)\) or even \(E(C)\) when
clear from the context.</p>

<p>
The language used to talk about Coalition Models is <strong>Coalition
Logic</strong> (Pauly 2001), a non-normal modal logic to express
choices of groups of players. Coalition Logic is an extension of
propositional logic with \(|2^{N}|\) modalities of the form \([C]\),
so a modal operator each indexed with a coalition.</p>

<p>
The satisfaction relation of the formulas of the form \([C]\varphi\)
with respect to a pair \(M,w\) is defined as follows:</p> 
\[M,w\models [C]\varphi \enskip\textrm{if and only if}\enskip \varphi^M\in E_w(C) \]

<p>
where, \(\varphi^M = \{w\in W \mid M,w\models\varphi\}\).</p>

<p>
Intuitively \(\varphi^M\in E_w(C)\) means that coalition \(C\) is able
to achieve property \(\varphi\).</p>

<p>
As closure under superset, or <strong>outcome monotonicity</strong>,
is taken to be a property of all effectivity functions, the rule of
monotonicity is valid in Coalition Logic, which is therefore a
monotonic modal logic (Hansen 2003).</p>

<p>
The rule of monotonicity takes this form for each \(C\subseteq
N\):</p> 
\[\frac{\varphi \to \psi}{[C]\varphi \to [C]\psi}\]

<p>
Intuitively, if \(C\) is able to achieve \(\varphi\) and we have that
\(\varphi\) implies \(\psi\), then \(C\) is also able to achieve
\(\psi\).</p>

<p>
<strong>Mathematical properties of power</strong> Apart from outcome
monotonicity, many other properties can be deemed necessary to model
coalitional power in games. For instance an effectivity function
typically has the following properties:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>liveness</strong>: i.e., \(\emptyset \not\in E(C)\), for
each \(C\subseteq N\);</li>

<li><strong>safety</strong>: i.e., \(W \in E(C)\), for each
\(C\subseteq N\);</li>

<li><strong>regularity</strong>: i.e., \(X \in E(C)\) implies that
\(\overline{X} \not\in E(\overline{C})\), for each \(C\subseteq N, X
\subseteq W\);</li>

<li><strong><em>N</em>-maximality</strong>: i.e., \(\overline{X} \in
E(\emptyset)\) implies that \({X} \in E(N)\) and \(X \subseteq
W\);</li>

<li><strong>superadditivity</strong>: i.e., \(X\in E(C)\) and \(Y \in
E(D)\) implies that \(X\cap Y \in E(C \cup D)\), for each \(C\), \(D
\subseteq N\), \(C \cap D = \emptyset\), \(X,Y \subseteq W\);</li>

<li><strong>coalition monotonicity</strong>: i.e., \(X \in E(C)\)
implies that \(X \in E(D)\), for each \(C\subseteq D \subseteq N\),
\(X \subseteq W\);</li>

<li><strong>well-foundedness</strong>: i.e., \(X \in E(N)\) implies
that \(\{x\} \in E(N)\), for some \(x \in X\), for each \(X \subseteq
W\).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
An effectivity function is called <strong>playable</strong> (Pauly
2001) if it has liveness, safety, <em>N</em>-maximality and
superadditivity. It is called <strong>truly playable</strong>
(Goranko, Jamroga, &amp; Turrini 2013) if it is playable and
well-founded. Observe that if \(W\) is finite, an effectivity function
is playable if and only if it is truly playable (Goranko <em>et
al</em>. 2013).</p>

<p>
True playability is a fundamental property of effectivity functions of
games, and connects one-shot coalitional games to one-shot
non-cooperative games, as will be clear later.</p>

<p class="indent" id="example5">
<strong>Example 5.</strong> The effectivity functions of our working
example are all truly playable.</p>

<p>
In neighborhood structures, relations between set-theoretical and
logical properties are often immediate and standard correspondence
results between class of frames and neighborhood functions (Chellas
1980) can be automatically used for Coalition Logic.</p>

<p>
Coalition Logic is in fact expressive enough to characterize all the
constraints mentioned so far, except the last one.</p>

<div class="indent" id="prop7">

<p>
<strong>Proposition 7.</strong> Let \(F=(W,E)\) be a Coalition Frame,
and \(C,C^{\prime}, C''\) be coalitions, such that \(C \cap
C'=\emptyset\) and \(C \subseteq C''\). The following results
hold:</p>

<ul>

<li>\(\models_F [C] \varphi \to \neg [\overline{C}]\neg \varphi\) if
and only if \(E\) is regular;</li>

<li>\(\models_F [C]\top\) if and only if \(E\) has safety;</li>

<li>\(\models_F [C] \varphi \to [C'']\varphi\) if and only if \(E\) is
coalition monotonic;</li>

<li>\(\models_F \neg [C] \bot\) if and only if \(E\) has
liveness;</li>

<li>\(\models_F \neg [\emptyset] \neg \varphi \to [N]\varphi\) if and
only if \(E\) is <em>N</em>-maximal;</li>

<li>\(\models_F [C^{\prime}] \varphi \wedge [C]\psi \to [C^{\prime}
\cup C](\varphi \wedge \psi)\) if and only if \(E\) is
superadditive;</li>

<li>\(\varphi \to \psi \models_F [C]\varphi \to [C]\psi\) if and only
if \(E\) is outcome monotonic.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
In fact, the axioms and deduction rule above are, in addition to
propositional logic, sound and complete with respect to the class of
all models with playable effectivity functions. For proofs, consult
Pauly 2001.</p>

<p>
Correspondence results allow us to distinguish by modal means a number
of classes of frames. However expressivity of the modal operators
strongly limit the capacity of the language to discern classes of
structures. To this extent the reader should notice that the logics of
both playable and truly playable effectivity frames share the fact
that \(\models_F [\emptyset]\top\). However this proposition, whose
interpretation is that for each \(w\in W, \{W\} \in E_w(\emptyset)\),
is not sufficient to make a formal distinction between
\(E_w(\emptyset)\) in the two different classes of effectivity
functions.</p>

<p>
Along these lines, the following result tells us that Coalition Logic
is also strong enough to reason about (or, if you prefer, too weak to
distinguish) truly playable effectivity functions.</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Theorem 8.</strong> (Goranko <em>et al</em>. 2013) Let
\(\mathcal{P}\) be the class of playable frames and
\(\mathcal{P}^{*}\) the class of truly playable ones. Then, for every
formula of Coalition Logic \(\varphi\)</p> 
\[\models_\mathcal{P} \varphi \textrm{ if and only if } \models_{\mathcal{P}^{*}} \varphi\]

<p>
This follows from the fact that Playable Coalition Logic has the
finite model property (Pauly 2001) and, in finite models, playable
effectivity functions are truly
 playable.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></p>

<h2 id="AnalPowe">3. Analyzing Power</h2>

<p>
This section looks at games in which individuals or groups take their
choices independently and concurrently, and, we stress once more,
abstracting away from how the interaction evolves in time. It pays
particular attention to the relation between players&rsquo; choices
and preferences, mentioning the role of knowledge, and most
importantly it deals with how to express solution concepts in a
logical language.</p>

<p>
The section first describes the general setting of cooperative games,
then it considers the more restricted and possibly better-known class
of non-cooperative games.</p>

<h3 id="CoopGameTheiLogi">3.1 Cooperative Games and Their Logic</h3>

<p>
The description of the game given in a relational structure of the
form \((\mathcal{N}, W, \succeq, E)\) is not enough to understand
which exact outcome <em>will be</em> chosen in the end. For that we
need a solution concept, i.e., a mapping that associates to a game a
set of outcomes of that game (Abdou &amp; Keiding 1991). We here
consider the general setting of <em>cooperative</em> or
<em>coalitional</em> games, where \(E: W \rightarrow (2^N \rightarrow
2^{2^W})\)is a (not necessarily playable) dynamic effectivity function
(again, strictly speaking a dynamic effectivity function assigns a
coalitional game to each state/outcome).</p>

<p>
A number of solution concepts have been introduced for coalitional
games (see for instance Osborne &amp; Rubinstein 1994, and Apt 2009
(Other Internet Resources)). For the present purposes we are only
going to discuss what is possibly the best-known: the core. The core
is a collection of stable outcomes, i.e., outcomes for which no
coalition exists whose members are both able and willing to deviate
from it. It can be seen as the set of outcomes to which <em>there is
no effective opposition</em> (Abdou &amp; Keiding 1991).</p>

<p>
Formally, given a relational structure \(F=(\mathcal{N}, W, \succeq,
E)\), an outcome \(w\in W\) is said to be <strong>stable</strong> (in
\(v\)) if there is no coalition \(C\) and set of outcomes \(X\subseteq
W\) such that both of the following conditions are satisfied:</p>

<ol>

<li>\(X \in E_v(C)\)</li>

<li>\(y \in X\) and \(i\in C\) implies that \(y \succ_i w\)</li>
</ol>

<p>
In words, an outcome is stable if there is no group of individuals
that can achieve an alternative that they all strictly prefer.</p>

<p>
The <strong>core</strong> is the collection of all stable
outcomes.</p>

<p class="indent" id="example6">
<strong>Example 6.</strong> Consider the outcome 1M, which is the only
outcome that Germany reckons acceptable. Germany, as already observed,
have an effectivity function of \(E(\{\textrm{Germany}\})=\{W\}\) so,
on their own, are not able to turn their preference into an outcome.
However, together with other Countries, they are able to do so.
Suppose their allies are Belgium, France and The Netherlands. Is 1M
then a <em>good</em> outcome? If we look at the preferences of the
other players in the coalition, i.e., Belgium, France, The
Netherlands, we observe the following. Belgium had rather an outcome
between 4M and 5M, France and The Netherlands exactly 5M. These
Countries could get together and select 5M, which is an outcome that
is acceptable to them. However the effectivity function of
\(\{\)Belgium, France, The Netherlands\(\}\) is \(E(\{\)Belgium,
France, The Netherlands\(\})=\{W\}\), which means that the three
Countries are not enough to pass the 5M bill. But the coalition made
by Belgium, France, Italy and The Netherlands would be. Notice
moreover that 5M is one of Italy&rsquo;s preferred outcomes. 5M is in
fact the only stable outcome of the game: there is no coalition that
is together willing and capable of deviating from it.</p>

<p>
Modal logic can be used to represent the core, with
\(E_w(C)\)interpreting \([C]\)as before. Consider first the
formula</p> 
\[p \rightarrow \bigvee_{C\subseteq N} [C]\left(\bigwedge_{i\in C}\Diamond^\succ_i p\right)\]

<p>
This says that if \(p\) is true then members of some coalition can
improve upon <em>some</em> \(p\) world, which does not seem the right
formula to express stability in logic. However we can prove the
following results, which utilizes the correspondence between the
formula and a specific class of frames.</p>

<p>
Let \(E\) be an (outcome monotonic) effectivity function and let
\(\succeq_i\) be a weak linear order. Then:</p> 
\[(F,V'), w \models p \rightarrow \bigvee_{C\subseteq N} [C]\left(\bigwedge_{i\in C}\Diamond^\succ_i p\right)\]

<p>
holds at \(w\) for <em>every</em> \(V'\) if and only there exists a
\(C\subseteq N\) and \(X \in E_w(C)\) such that, for all \(i\in C\),
\(x\in X\) we have that \(x \succ_i w\).</p>

<p>
So the formula holds at \(w\) for every valuation if and only if \(w\)
does not belong to the core. Clearly, if the formula is false at an
outcome and some valuation, then this means that the outcome does
belong to the core.</p>

<p>
Notice that, since effectivity functions are outcome monotonic, if we
have that if \(X \in E_w(C)\) and</p> 
\[X \subseteq \left(\bigwedge_{i\in C} \Diamond^\succ_i p\right)^{(F,V')},\]

<p>
then</p> 
\[\left(\bigwedge_{i\in C} \Diamond^\succ_i p\right)^{(F,V')} \in E_w(C).\]

<p>
Also notice that the result above allows for the case of</p>

\[\emptyset=\left(\bigwedge_{i\in C}\Diamond^\succ_i p\right)^{M} \in E_w(C),\]

<p>
which might be counterintuitive. Requiring \(E\) to have liveness
takes care of this.</p>

<p>
Notice also how we had to impose a universal quantification on the set
of valuations. Without this explicit quantification, the formula would
only hold for one specific model, which would not be an appropriate
solution. If instead we are only interested in knowing whether
<em>there exists</em> some outcome that is stable or, conversely,
whether the core is empty, it is sufficient to require the formula
above to be valid. This would amount to say that <em>no</em> outcome
is stable, i.e., that the core is empty.</p>

<div class="indent" id="prop10">

<p>
<strong>Proposition 10.</strong> Let \(F\) be a frame with \(E_w =
E_v\)for every \(w,v \in W\). We have that</p> 
\[\models_F p \rightarrow \bigvee_{C\subseteq N} [C]\left(\bigwedge_{i\in C}\Diamond^\succ_i p\right)\]

<p>
if and only if no outcome in \(F\) belongs to the core.</p>
</div>

<p>
Again, liveness would take care of the trivial case in which</p>

\[\left(\bigwedge_{i\in C}\Diamond^\succ_i p\right)^{(F,V)}=\emptyset.\]

<p>
An alternative approach is to identify each outcome with a name (or,
in the language of hybrid logic, a <em>nominal</em>) in the language.
Then we have the following.</p>

<div class="indent" id="prop11">

<p>
<strong>Proposition 11.</strong> Let \(w_k\) an atomic proposition be
true at outcome \(w_k\) and only at outcome \(w_k\).</p> 
\[(F,V), w_k \models w_k \rightarrow \bigvee_{C\subseteq N} [C]\left(\bigwedge_{i\in C}\Diamond^\succ_i w_k\right)\]

<p>
if and only if \(w_k\) does not belong to the core.</p>
</div>

<p>
Yet another alternative is to have atoms for coalitional power
(&Aring;gotnes, van der Hoek and Wooldridge 2009): \((F,V), w \models
p_C\) iff \(w \in E_w(C)\). Then:</p>

<div class="indent" id="prop12">

<p>
<strong>Proposition 12.</strong> Let \(w_k\) an atomic proposition be
true at outcome \(w_k\) and only at outcome \(w_k\).</p> 
\[((F,V), w \models \bigvee_{C \subseteq N} \diamond^\succ p_C\]

<p>
if and only if \(w\) does not belong to the core in \(E_w\).</p>
</div>

<p>
Emptyness of the core of \(E_w\)can then furthermore be expressed
using the universal modality \(A\) from Section 2.1: \((F,V), w
\models A(\bigvee_{C \subseteq N} \diamond^\succ p_C)\).</p>

<p>
So depending on the properties we are interested in, different
extensions of basic modal logic combined with different forms of
validity (at a world vs model vs frame) are best-suited to express
them.</p>

<h3 id="NonCoopGamesLogic">3.2 Non-cooperative Games and Their Logic</h3>

<p>
Non-cooperative games are a representation of what individuals, rather
than coalitions, can achieve, and what their preferences are.</p>

<p>
Formally, a <em>strategic game form</em> is a tuple</p> 
\[(N, W, \{\Sigma_i\}_{i\in N}, o)\]

<p>
where <em>N</em> is a finite set of players, \(W\) a set of outcomes,
\(\{\Sigma_i\}_{i\in N}\) a collection of strategies, one for each
player \(i\), \(o: \prod_{i\in N} \Sigma_i \to W\) an outcome
function, associating a tuple of strategies to an outcome.</p>

<p>
A non-cooperative game is a tuple \((S,\{\succeq_i\}_{i\in N})\),
where \(S\) is a strategic game form and \(\{\succeq_i\}_{i\in N}\) a
collection of preference relations, one for each player \(i\).</p>

<div class="indent" id="example7">

<p>
<strong>Example 7.</strong> If we think of the Countries in our
previous example as individual players and their votes as individual
strategies, we can model the Treaty of Rome game as a non-cooperative
game, where each individual can vote an amount of money to dedicate to
border protection and preferences are as above.</p>

<p>
The outcome function will take care to associate to each individual
player&rsquo;s vote the final outcome of the collective decision,
e.g., selecting an outcome voted by a set of Countries with voting
weight of at least 12, or resulting in no decision if no consensus is
reached.</p>

<p>
For instance:</p>

<ul>

<li>France vote 0M</li>

<li>Belgium vote 2M</li>

<li>Italy vote 10M</li>

<li>Germany vote 0M</li>

<li>The Netherlands vote 0M</li>

<li>Luxembourg vote 0M</li>
</ul>

<p>
This round results in no decision, because no outcome has collected
voting weight of at least 12.</p>

<p>
However, suppose that the second round is such that everyone but
Belgium stick to their vote, and assume Belgium switches to voting 0M.
Now 0M has an aggregate of 13, which means it is chosen as the final
decision.</p>
</div>

<p>
Looking at the unified treatment of our example, there seem to be
relationship between non-cooperative games and cooperative games. This
relationship can be specified formally.</p>

<p>
Let us first consider what a group of players can do in a game. To do
so we define the <strong>\(\alpha\)-effectivity function</strong>, a
mathematical description of coalitional strategies in a game in terms
of the sets outcomes that they can force.</p>

<div class="indent" id="def12">

<p>
<strong>Definition 12.</strong> [\(\alpha\)-effectivity function] Let
\(S\) be a non-cooperative game. We define the \(\alpha\) effectivity
function of \(S\), \(E^{\alpha}_S(C)\), where \(\overline{C}\) is the
complement of \(C\):</p>

<p class="indent">
\(E^{\alpha}_S(C)= \{X\ \mid\) there exists \(\sigma_C\) such that for
all \(\sigma'_{\overline{C}}\) we have that
\(o(\sigma_C,\sigma'_{\overline{C}})\in X \}\)</p>
</div>

<p>
Intuitively the \(\alpha\)-effectivity function of \(S\) collects, for
every group of players, the set of outcomes that they can achieve by
fixing a strategy of theirs, no matter how their opponents play.</p>

<p>
The following result shows the relationship between strategies and
effectivity functions.</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Theorem 13</strong> (Goranko <em>et al</em>. 2013). An
effectivity function is truly playable if and only if it is the
\(\alpha\)-effectivity function of some non-cooperative game.</p>

<p>
This is a generalization of the result in Peleg 1998 for finite games,
starting from models of non-cooperative games first defined in Pauly
2001. In a nutshell what these results imply is the following.</p>

<div class="indent" id="prop15">

<p>
<strong>Proposition 14.</strong> Let \(F\) be a relational game
structure. Then \(E_w\) is the \(\alpha\)-effectivity function of some
non-cooperative game, for each \(w \in W\), if and only if the
following formulas are valid in \(F\) for disjoint
\(C,C^{\prime}\):</p>

<ul>

<li>\(\varphi \to \psi \models_F [C]\varphi \to [C]\psi\)</li>

<li>\(\models_F [C] \top\)</li>

<li>\(\models_F \neg [C] \bot\)</li>

<li>\(\models_F \neg [\emptyset] \varphi \to [N]\varphi\)</li>

<li>\(\models_F [C^{\prime}] \varphi \wedge [C]\psi \to [C^{\prime}
\cup C](\varphi \wedge \psi)\)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
In the same way we did for cooperative games, we can ask ourselves
whether an outcome is stable, or rational, in a strategic
situation.</p>

<p>
<strong>Nash equilibrium and definability</strong> The main solution
concept to analyze non-cooperative games is Nash equilibrium.
Informally a Nash equilibrium is a collection of strategies, one per
player, such that no player is interested to change his or her
strategy, given the others stick to theirs. Formally, a strategy
profile \(\sigma\) is a (pure strategy) <strong>Nash
equilibrium</strong> if for all players \(i\in N\) and for all
\(\sigma'_i\in \Sigma_i\) we have that</p> 
\[o(\sigma_i,\sigma_{-i}) \succeq_i o(\sigma'_i,\sigma_{-i})\]

<div class="indent" id="example8">

<p>
<strong>Example 8.</strong> Consider the following vote</p>

<ul>

<li>France vote 5M</li>

<li>Belgium vote 5M</li>

<li>Italy vote 10M</li>

<li>Germany vote 1M</li>

<li>The Netherlands vote 5M</li>

<li>Luxembourg vote 5M</li>
</ul>

<p>
In this game there is no consensus on any budget. The situation might
look like a deadlock, as everyone has voted according to their
preference. However the outcome is disagreement, which no player
prefers to any agreement. The only way that players can converge to an
agreement is that Italy change their vote to 5M. If this happens 5M is
achieved as an outcome.</p>

<p>
Notice that the modified game, in which Italy vote 5M is a Nash
equilibrium.</p>

<p>
Consider now a modification of the game above, in which Italy and The
Netherlands vote 10M, while the others stick to their vote.
Surprisingly, despite the disagreement, this is Nash equilibrium,
because no player is simultaneously able to get to some agreement,
although being willing to do so.</p>
</div>

<p>
How to express Nash equilibria in logic? Recall how the formula</p>

\[p\to \bigvee_{C\subseteq N} [C]\left(\bigwedge_{i\in C}\Diamond^\succ_i p\right)\]

<p>
holds at a frame \(F\) if and only if the core is empty, and a hybrid
logic extension can tell us whether a specific outcome belongs to the
core. If \(F\) is based on a truly playable effectivity function we
already have a non-cooperative form game version of the core: an
outcome such that no coalition is together able and willing to deviate
from, <em>not taking into account</em> what the others do. However
Nash Equilibrium fixes a profile of strategies, such that no player is
able and willing to deviate from there. In other words it requires the
notion of best response for a player with respect to a given
profile.</p>

<p>
Formalisms such as Coalition Logic are too weak to express Nash
equilibria. However, they can express the fact that certain
effectivity functions allow for the possibility of a Nash equilibrium.
This is what in Hansen &amp; Pauly 2002 is called Nash-consistent
Coalition Logic. Nash Equilibrium is in fact not definable in basic
modal logic (van Benthem <em>et al</em>. 2011), but it can be done
with a modality that <em>intersects</em> both the preference and the
choice relations (van Benthem <em>et al</em>. 2011) (for choice
relations see Section 3.2.2 below).</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
\((F,V),w\models \langle \approx_i \cap \succ_i \rangle \varphi\) if
and only if \(w(\approx_i \cap \succ_i)w'\) implies that \(w'\models
\varphi \)</p>
</div>

<p>
Then the best response for \(i\) is defined as \( \langle \approx_i
\cap \succ_i \rangle \top\), as there is no alternative that is at the
same time achievable and preferable to \(i\). Alternatively a hybrid
logic that mentions strategy profiles in the language can provide a
solution, similarly to the case of the core.</p>

<h4 id="InjGamesPDL">3.2.1 Injective Games and PDL with Intersection</h4>

<p>
The general definition of non-cooperative games given above allows
games where two different strategy profiles lead to the same outcome,
i.e., where \(o(\sigma) = o(\sigma')\) for \(\sigma \neq \sigma'\)-
where the outcome function is not <em>injective</em>. However in game
theory injectivity is very often implicitly or explicitly assumed.
Indeed, outcomes are often identified with strategy profiles.</p>

<p>
It is thus a natural question what happens to Coalition Logic when we
restrict non-cooperative games to be injective. The answer is that,
first, not much: the language of Coalition Logic cannot discern
between injective and non-injective games (Goranko <em>et al</em>.
2006). But, second, the class of effectivity functions changes: not
all truly playable effectivity functions are \(\alpha\)-effectivity
functions of injective games.</p>

<p>
Recall the <em>well-foundedness</em> property of effectivity
functions: if \(X \in E(N)\)then \(\{x\} \in E(N)\) for some \(x \in
X\). This is in fact equivalent (Goranko <em>et al</em>. 2013) to the
property that \(E(\emptyset)\) has a <em>complete non-monotonic
core</em>. The non-monotonic core \(E^{nc}(C)\)of \(E(C)\) its minimal
elements: \(E^{nc}(C) = \{X \in E(C) : \neg \exists Y (Y \in E(C)
\text{ and } Y \subset X\}\). The non-monotonic core is
<em>complete</em> if and only if for every \(X \in E(C)\) there is a
\(Y \in E^{nc}(C)\) such that \(Y \subseteq X\). While true
playability implies that the non-monotonic core for the empty
coalition is complete, that is not the case for arbitrary
coalitions.</p>

<p>
It is, however, for injective games: in addition to the true
playability properties, the \(\alpha\)-effectivity functions of
injective games have a complete non-monotonic core for <em>all
coalitions</em>. In addition, the non-monotonic core has some
structural properties. In more detail, we say that an effectivity
function \(E\) is <em>injectively playable</em> (&Aring;gotnes and
Alechina 2015) iff it is truly playable and has the following
additional properties, for all \(C, i, j, X, Y\):</p>

<ul>

<li>\(E(C)\) has a complete non-monotonic core;</li>

<li>\(E^{nc}(C) = \{\bigcap_{i \in C} X_i : X_i \in E^{nc}(\{i\})\}\)
when \(C \neq \emptyset\);</li>

<li>if \(X, Y \in E^{nc}(\{i\})\) and \(X \neq Y\) then \(X \cap Y =
\emptyset\);</li>

<li>if \(X \in E^{nc}(j)\) and \(x \in X\) then \(\exists Y \in
E^{nc}(i), x \in Y\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
It follows that \(E(C)\) is completely determined by its non-monotonic
core.</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Theorem 15.</strong> (&Aring;gotnes and Alechina 2015) An
effectivity function is injectively playable if and only if it is the
\(\alpha\)-effectivity function of some injective non-cooperative
game.</p>

<p>
<em>Intersection</em> plays a key role in the effectivity of
coalitions in games: intuitively, the power of a coalition is the
intersection of the power of the individuals in the coalition. A
natural idea then, due to van Benthem 2012, is that coalitional power
could perhaps be expressed by using <em>intersection</em>
<em>modalities</em>. This is indeed the case, in the following precise
sense (&Aring;gotnes and Alechina 2015): there is a satsifiability
preserving translation from Coalition Logic to Propositional Dynamic
Logic with Intersection (Gargov <em>et al</em>. 1988). This
translation relies on the fact that for every non-injective game there
is a (Coalition Logic) equivalent injective game.</p>

<h4 id="NonMonoActiLogi">3.2.2 Non-monotonic Action Logics</h4>

<p>
Some logics exploit a more compact representation of those relational
structures that correspond to non-cooperative games.</p>

<p>
Rather than using effectivity functions, each player \(i\) is
associated with an equivalence relation \(\approx_i \subseteq W\times
W\), whose induced partition represent the choices he or she can
perform. These equivalence relations describe the exact set of choices
that a group of players can perform and the originating models are
referred to as <em>consequentialist</em> in the literature (see for
instance Belnap, Perloff, &amp; Ming 2001).</p>

<p>
Now define an effectivity function \(E^{*}\) for which it holds
that</p> 
\[E^{*}(i)= \{[x] \mid x' \in [x] \mbox{ whenever } x \approx_i x' \}^{+}\]

<p>
Intuitively \(E^{*}(i)\) collects what <em>exactly</em> the
individuals can achieve and all their supersets.</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
\(E^{*}\) is called <strong>consequentialist</strong> if holds
that:</p>

<ul>

<li>\(E^{*}(C)= \{\bigcap_{i\in C} X_i \mid \mbox{for some } X_i \in
E^{*}(i)\}\)</li>

<li>\(\emptyset\not\in E^{*}(C)\) for each \(C\neq N\)</li>

<li>\(E^{*}(N) = \{\{x\} \mid x \in W\}^{+}\)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Notice that \(E^*\) is a truly playable effectivity function.</p>

<p>
The last property is well-foundedness, as in the case of arbitrary
effectivity functions. This is not a property that is assumed in all
variants, e.g., the choice structures in Kooi &amp; Tamminga 2008 and
its temporal variant STIT (Belnap <em>et al</em>. 2001) do not.
However, as observed in Turrini 2012 and Tamminga 2013, well-founded
consequentialist models correspond to non-cooperative games and the
effectivity function \(E\) can be effectively simulated by the
equivalence relation \(\approx_i\) for each player. Intuitively
\(E^{*}(i)\) is the set of sets of outcomes that \(i\) can choose
without being able to refine further.</p>

<p>
To reason about consequentialist models, we use so-called
consequentialist logics, i.e., propositional logic extended with
modalities of the form \([C]\varphi\), interpreted as follows:</p>

<p class="indent">
\(M,w \models [C]\varphi\) if and only if \(M,w'\models \varphi\) for
all \(w'\) such that \(w (\bigcap_{i \in C} \approx_i)w'\)</p>

<p>
Consequentialist logics have been developed to reason about action and
consequence, and have interesting applications in deontic logic, such
as Kooi &amp; Tamminga 2008; Tamminga 2013; Turrini 2012. They are
moreover the basis of temporal logics of strategy such as STIT and
strategic STIT, discussed later. A special case are the logics of
propositional control (Hoek &amp; Wooldridge 2005; Troquard, Hoek,
&amp; Wooldridge 2009).</p>

<h4 id="QuantHighOrd">3.2.3 Quantified and Higher-order Coalition Logic</h4>

<p>
Many interesting properties of power in games involve quantifying over
coalitions, for example the notion of agent \(i\) being a <em>weak
veto player</em> (Wooldridge and Dunne 2004) with respect to \(\phi\),
in the sense that any coalition that can enforce \(\phi\) must include
\(i\), or, in some first or higher-order extension of Coalition Logic:
\(\forall C ([C]\phi \rightarrow i \in C)\). <em>Quantified Coalition
Logic (QCL)</em> (&Aring;gotnes <em>et al</em>. 2008) extends
Coalition Logic with a limited form of quantification over coalitions,
without making the resulting logic undecidable or indeed increasing
the computational complexity of the satisfiability problem. In QCL
coalitions inside modalities are replaced with coalition predicates.
Intuitively, \([P]\phi\) (\(\langle P \rangle \phi\)) means that any
(some) coalition satisfying the predicate \(P\) has the ability to
enforce \(\phi\). As an example, \(i\) is a weak veto player for
\(\phi\):</p> 
\[ \neg \langle \neg supseteq(\{i\})\rangle \phi \]

<p>
&ndash; it is not the case that any coalition that is not a superset
of \(\{i\}\) has the power to enforce \(\phi\). Or that \(i\) is a
<em>dictator</em> for \(\phi\): \(\neg \langle \neg
supseteq(\{i\})\rangle \phi \wedge [supseteq(\{i\})]\phi\)<em>.</em>
Such properties, and indeed all properties that can be expressed in
QCL, can already be expressed in Coalition Logic, by using disjunction
and conjunction to quantify over coalitions, but those expressions
would typically be exponentially long in the number of agents. QCL can
express such properties concisely, and indeed is exponentially more
succinct than Coalition Logic. QCL can also be further extended with
Belief-Intention-Desire (BDI) logic (Chen <em>et al</em>. 2014)
without increasing complexity.</p>

<p>
<em>Higher-order Coalition Logic (HCL)</em> (Boella <em>et al</em>.
2010) extends QCL with to a monadic second-order language, unifying
the languages for describing coalitions and for describing their power
and significantly extending the expressive power. Expressive tractable
fragments of HCL exist (Doherty <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p>

<h4 id="ProbResou">3.2.4 Probabilities and Resource Bounds</h4>

<p>
As we have seen, the (truly playable) effectivity functions of
Coalition Logic correspond to games where a joint strategy profile for
the set of all agents uniquely determines the outcome. Colition Logic
can be modified in several ways (Naumov <em>et al</em>. 2021) to deal
with <em>stochastic games</em>, i.e., where such a profile only
determines a probability distribution over the set of possible
outcomes. Having modalities \([C]_p \phi\) interpreted as "\(C\) can
enforce \(\phi\) with probability \(p\)" leads to interesting and
non-trivial (in)valid properties, such as the following variant of
superadditivity \((C \cap C' = \emptyset)\)</p> 
\[ [C]_p(\phi\rightarrow \psi) \rightarrow
([C']_q \phi \rightarrow [C \cup C']_{max\{p,q\}} \psi) \]

<p>
not being valid, while</p> 
\[ [N]_{p+q+r}(\phi \vee \psi\vee \sigma)
\rightarrow [N]_{2p}(\phi \vee \psi) \vee [N]_{2q}(\psi \vee \sigma)
\vee [N]_{2r} (\phi \vee \sigma) \]

<p>
(where \(N\) is the set of all agents) is valid.</p>

<p>
As an alternative to stochastic transitions, games with stochastic
<em>failures</em> can be considerered, which from a logical viewpoint
are somewhat easier to deal with (Naumov <em>et al</em>. 2021).
Interpreting \([C]_p \phi\) as "\(C\) can has a joint strategy to
ensure that \(\phi\) is true in each outcome and which is guaranteed
not to fail with probability at least \(p\) no matter what the other
agents do", we get, e.g., that the variant of the superadditivity
axiom mentioned above holds.</p>

<p>
<em>Resource bounds</em> have also been added to coalitional
modalities, interpreted in coalition models corresponding to games
with costs on performing joint actions (Alechina <em>et al</em>.
2009). Here, \([C^b]\phi\) means that \(C\) can force \(\phi\) to be
true under resource bound \(b\), i.e., that they can chose a joint
action costing at most \(b\) that will ensure that \(\phi\) is true.
These modalities satisfy the following variant of superadditivity \((C
\cap D = \emptyset, C \neq \emptyset, D \neq \emptyset)\):</p>

\[ [C^b]\phi \wedge [D^d]\psi \rightarrow [(C \cup D)^{b+d}](\phi \wedge \psi). \]

<h4 id="CondPowe">3.2.5 Conditional Power and Coordination</h4>

<p>
From the viewpoints of truly playable effectivity functions and
Coalition Logic, two games are equivalent if coalitions have the same
power as defined by \(\alpha\)-effectivity. Van Benthem <em>et
al</em>. 2019 point out, however, that there are meaningful
differences between games with same \(\alpha\)-effectivity, due to
<em>monotonicity</em>: \(\{w,v\} \in E(C)\) might be the case for two
different reasons. First, it might be that there is a joint action by
\(C\) such that there is a joint action by the other agents such that
the outcome will be \(w\) <em>and</em> there is another joint action
by the other agents such that the outcome will be \(v\), or, second,
it might be that that is true for only \(w\) <em>or</em> \(v\) (in
which case \(\{w\} \in E(C)\) or \(\{v\} \in E(C)\)). The first kind
of power is called <em>basic</em> power by van Benthem <em>et al</em>.
2019, who characterise the properties of effectivity functions of
basic power in the two-agent case and gives a sound and complete
axiomatisation using a variant of Instantial Neighbourhood Logic (INL)
(van Benthem <em>et al</em>. 2010) which again is an extension of
standard modal logic with neighborhood semantics. One significance of
basic power is that it captures all the outcome sets in which the
other players are free to chose any state, given the choice of one of
those outcome states for some coalition.</p>

<p>
Several extensions of the Coalition Logic language have also been
developed to reason about conditional and inter-related power between
agents and coalitions, typically combining existential and universal
quantification over choices. Goranko and Enqvist 2018 introduce
extended coalition operators of the form</p> 
\[ [C](\phi; \psi_1, \ldots, \psi_k) \]

<p>
with the intuitive meaning that \(C\) has the power to make \(\phi\)
true while at the same time making it possible that the other agents
at the same time can achieve any of the objectives \(\psi_1,\ldots,
\psi_k\). The resulting logic can also be seen as a multi-agent
extension of INL. Goranko and Enqvist 2018 also introduce operators of
the form</p> 
\[ [C_1\triangleright\phi_1, \ldots, C_n\triangleright \phi_n] \]

<p>
with the intuitive meaning that the coalition \(C = C_1 \cup \cdots
C_n\) has a joint strategy such that, for each \(i\), the restriction
of that joint strategy to coalition \(C_i\) enforces objective
\(\phi_i\).</p>

<p>
Goranko and Ju 2022 notice that the latter type of operator can be
used to express a certain kind of <em>conditional</em> power, namely
\([A \triangleright \phi, A \cup B \triangleright \psi]\), intuitively
saying that \(A\) have a joint action that enforces \(\phi\) while at
the same time enables \(B\) to apply a joint action that will enforce
\(\psi\). They also introduce two additional conditional power
modalities:</p> 
\[ [A]_\alpha(\phi; \langle B\rangle\psi) \text{ and } [A]_\beta(\phi; \langle B\rangle\psi) \]

<p>
where the former says that \(B \setminus A\) have a joint strategy
such that if \(A\) applies any action that ensures \(\phi\), then that
joint strategy (by \(B\setminus A\)) at the same time ensures
\(\psi\), and the latter that for any joint action by \(A\) that
enforces \(\phi\) there is a consistent joint action by \(B\) that at
the same time enforces \(\psi\). These notions of power correspond to
\(\alpha\)- and \(\beta\)- effectivity, respectively.</p>

<p>
Coordination is an issue not only between different coalitions, but
also between the agents in the coalition \(C\) in the interpretation
of \([C]\phi\). In Coalition Logic it is implicitly assumed, like it
often is (Schelling 1960), that the agents in \(C\) somehow can
coordinate their actions to achieve the outcome \(\phi\). Hawke 2017
introduces a new variant of the coalition modalities that captures a
stronger notion of coalitional ability, relaxes the assumption about
coordination (in the case of two agents). Contrary to \([C],\) these
new modalities \(((C))\) are not monotonic.</p>

<h4 id="DynaCoal">3.2.6 Dynamic Coalition Logic</h4>

<p>
Inspired by the model update semantics of
 <a href="../dynamic-epistemic/">dynamic epistemic logic,</a>
 Coalition Logic has been extended in several ways with dynamic
modalities modeling changes in the ability of coalitions in different
ways. Broersen, Meyer and Turrini 2009 add expressions of the form
\([C \downarrow \psi]\phi\) with the intuitive meaning that after
\(C\) chooses \(\psi\), \(\phi\) holds. &Aring;gotnes and Galimullin
2021 add modalities for adding and removing actions and ability,
inspired by arrow update logic: \([(\phi,a,\psi)^+]\gamma\)
intuitively means that after the coalition model is updated by, in
each \(\phi\)-state, adding a new action for agent \(a\) such that no
matter what the other agents do that action will guarantee \(\psi\),
then \(\gamma\) holds. There are similar modalities for removing
ability. &Aring;gotnes and Galimullin 2023 extend Coalition Logic with
more general and expressive modalities for <em>coalitional action
models</em>, inspired by epistemic action models.</p>

<h4 id="LogiBasedGames">3.2.7 Logic-Based Games</h4>

<p>
In many situations agents have control over certain propositional
variables (Hoek &amp; Wooldridge 2005), for instance they can be
responsible for traffic flow or they can veto a certain issue.
Variables can also be shared (Gerbrandy 2006), an example being
voting, where players share control over a variable whose realization
is determined by a certain aggregation function, e.g., majority
(Troquard, Hoek, &amp; Wooldridge 2011). These logics of
<em>propositional control</em> specify what propositions agents have
in their effectivity function. For instance, if agent \(i\) controls
\(p\), then both \(p^{M}\) and \(\neg p^{M}\) are in his or her
effectivity function. In a way these models are very special types of
effectivity function, and what agents control can be seen as a choice,
or a strategy, available to them.</p>

<p>
Logics for propositional control have modalities of the type
\([[i]]\varphi\), meaning that player \(i\) has a
&ldquo;control&rdquo; strategy to see to it that, no matter how the
other agents choose their control strategies, then \(\varphi\) holds
in the end. But they also have modalities of the type
\([[C]]\varphi\), meaning that players in \(C\) have a joint control
strategy ensuring \(\varphi\) in the end. A strategy profile is thus
equivalent to a valuation function, which assigns a truth value of
every proposition available. In turn, a strategy of a player \(i\) can
thus be seen as a partial valuation function, that assigns a truth
value only to the propositions controlled by \(i\).</p>

<p>
Slightly abusing notation, we say that a valuation \(V\) satisfies a
formula \(\varphi\), denoted \(V \models \varphi\), whenever it makes
\(\varphi\) true under the current assignment of propositions. In
other words, propositional control games are played in one single
world, and the individual assignments determine what propositions are
true are that world. Denoting \(\mathcal{V}\) the set of all
valuations and \(\mathcal{V}_i\) to the partial ones under the control
of \(i\) we have the following.</p>

<p class="indent">
\((F,V) \models [[C]]\varphi\) if and only if for all \(i \in C\),
there exists \(V'_i \in \mathcal{V}_i\) such that, for all \(k \in
\overline{C}, V'_{k}\in \mathcal{V}_k\), we have that \((F,V')\models
\varphi\)</p>

<p>
So when \([[C]]\varphi\) holds, coalition \(C\) can play a control
strategy in such a way that no matter what the control strategy is
that their opponents play, the resulting outcome satisfies
\(\varphi\).</p>

<p>
Logics for propositional control can be extended to goal-based
formalisms, the so called Boolean games (Harrenstein, van der Hoek,
Meyer, &amp; Witteveen 2001): propositions are partitioned among the
players, with each player controlling the set of propositions he or
she is assigned to. On top of that each player is also assigned a
formula of propositional logic which is meant to be his or her goal
and whose realization might not only depend upon the choices he or she
is able to make.</p>

<p>
Boolean games have been extensively studied in the field of
multi-agent systems, as simple and compact models to represent
strategic interaction in a logic-based setting (Dunne &amp; Hoek 2004;
Dunne &amp; Wooldridge 2012; Dunne, Hoek, Kraus, &amp; Wooldridge
2008).</p>

<p>
In their most general variants they are an extension of logics with
propositional control, where each agent is assigned a goal formula.
The goal formula is a satisfiable formula of the language and the
important feature is that the goal of each agent does not need to be
under his or her control.</p>

<p>
For instance, agent \(i\) may be assigned the control of proposition
\(p\) only, but might have the goal that \(p \leftrightarrow q\). So
whether \(i\)&rsquo;s goal is satisfied depends not only on \(i\)
setting proposition \(p\) to be true, but also some other agent, say
\(j\), setting proposition \(q\) to be true. Agent \(j\), on the other
hand, might or might not be interested in having \(q\) set to true.
For instance he or she may want proposition \(r\) to be true, and
therefore being indifferent to whether \(q\) or \(\overline{q}\) is
realized in the end. Or might even have the goal that
\(\overline{q}\).</p>

<p>
In Boolean games some objectives can be realized all together, for
instance agents might all want \(p \vee \neg q\) to be true, or it
might be the case that certain valuations do not realize the
objectives of all agents, but no unhappy agent is able to improve his
or her own situation by changing the assignment to the propositional
variables he or she controls. This situation is a very simple form of
Nash equilibrium that can be expressed in Boolean games.</p>

<p>
So, for \(\gamma_i\) being the objective of player \(i\) and \(v_i\) a
partial valuation that is under control of player \(i\), we say that
valuation \(v\) is a Nash equilibrium if we have that for each \(i\)
and each \(v'_i\).</p> 
\[(v_i,v_{-i}) \not\models\gamma_i \mbox{ implies that } (v'_i,v_{-i})
\not\models\gamma_i\]

<p>
So if \(v\) does not satisfy \(i\)&rsquo;s goal, there is nothing
\(i\) can do to satisfy it.</p>

<p>
The analysis of Nash equilibria in Boolean game shows a close
correspondence between these games and propositional logic: using a
reduction to the satisfiability problem of propositional logic
formulas, the problem of checking whether an outcome \(v\) is a Nash
equilibrium of a Boolean game is co-NP complete (Wooldridge, Endriss,
Kraus, &amp; Lang 2013).</p>

<p>
Another common approach to concisely representing certain classes of
games, in addition to representing payoffs qualitatively, is to impose
restrictions on the payoff functions. An approach combining the two is
found in Das <em>et al</em>. 2023, in which Monadic Least Fixed Point
logic is used to express the existence of pure strategy Nash
equilibria for games with pairwise separable payoff functions.</p>

<h2 id="ConcRighLeveAnal">4. Conclusions: On the Right Level of Analysis</h2>

<p>
Recall the very first example, in which the set of outcomes of a
voting game could be described only considering the overall outcome of
the vote or by explicitly describing what each of the Countries had
voted.</p>

<p>
Often times, when describing mathematical structures by succinct
languages we are confronted with the question of which one is the most
suitable language. Some are able to express preferences, knowledge and
coalitional ability all together, some others only two of these,
some others only one. Finally some languages might only be able
to express what individuals, and not coalitions, can achieve.</p>

<p>
Again, there is no right answer to this question. It all depends on
what the fundamental characteristics are that one is trying to model.
To express Nash equilibria in a coordination game, there is no need
for a temporal logic-based formalism. On the contrary, if one wants to
express backwards induction, then a language that does not make the
sequential structure of the decision problem explicit is probably not
the right one.</p>

<p>
Going back to our example, some Countries might have preferences over
how other Countries vote, and this might affect their decision-making,
changing the overall equilibrium points of the game. If this is the
case then the richer language matters. Otherwise, if we can safely
rule out this possibility, the more succinct language seems to be the
appropriate choice.</p>

<p>
The theory of evolution by natural selection is, perhaps, the crowning
intellectual achievement of the biological sciences. There is
considerable debate, though, about which entities are selected in an
evolutionary process. This article aims to clarify these debates by
identifying four distinct, though often confused, theoretical and
empirical research questions, as well as two schools of multilevel
genetics; the debates themselves are clarified by highlighting which
of these four research questions, or their combinations, are central
in each debate.</p>

<h2 id="Intr">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
When we think of evolutionary theory and natural selection, we usually
think of, say, a herd of deer, in which some deer are faster than
others escaping their predators. These swifter deer will, all things
being equal, (on average) leave more offspring, and these offspring
will tend to be swifter than other deer. Thus, we get a change in the
average swiftness of deer over evolutionary time. In a case like this,
the &ldquo;unit of selection&rdquo;, often called the
&ldquo;target&rdquo; of selection, is (at least) the single
macro-organism, the individual deer, and the property being selected,
swiftness, also lies at the organismic level; it is exhibited by the
whole deer, not by either parts of deer, such as cells, or groups of
deer, such as herds. But there are other levels of biological
organization that have been proposed to be units or targets of
selection&mdash;levels at which evolution by selection may act to
increase the population&rsquo;s distribution of a given property at
that level of biological organization.</p>

<p>
But for over forty years, some participants in the &ldquo;units of
selection&rdquo; debates have argued that more than one issue is at
 stake.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 The notions of &ldquo;replicator&rdquo; and &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo;
were introduced, to stand for different roles in the evolutionary
process (Dawkins 1976, 1982a,b). The individual deer, above, would be
called the &ldquo;vehicles&rdquo; and their genes that make them tend
to be swifter would be called the &ldquo;replicators&rdquo;. The
&ldquo;genic selection&rdquo; argument proceeded to assert that the
units of selection debates should not be about vehicles, as they
formerly had been, since Darwin, but about replicators. It was then
asserted that the &ldquo;replicator&rdquo; subsumes two distinct
functional roles, which can be broken up into &ldquo;replicator&rdquo;
and &ldquo;interactor&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Dawkins&hellip;has replicators interacting with their environment in
two ways&mdash;to produce copies of themselves and to influence their
own survival and the survival of their copies. (Hull 1980: 318)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The new view would call the individual deer, &ldquo;interactors&rdquo;
(Hull
 1980).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 However, one philosopher found that the two-part
replicator-interactor distinction was still inadequate for addressing
key controversies about units, specifically debates about species
selection and group selection, (as well as holobionts, later), and so
introduced two additional distinct research questions that are also
pursued under the rubric of &ldquo;units or levels of
selection&rdquo;: In a given selection process, &ldquo;what entity
acts as the <em>manifestor of adaptation</em>?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;What
entity is the <em>beneficiary</em>?&rdquo; (Lloyd 1988[1994]).</p>

<p>
The purpose of this entry is to delineate further the four quite
distinct research questions pursued under the rubric of &ldquo;the
units and levels of
 selection&rdquo;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 (see the entry on
 <a href="../biology-individual/">biological individuals</a>)
 In
 <a href="#FourBasiReseQues">section 2</a>,
 four distinct research questions are introduced.
 <a href="#AnatDeba">Section 3</a>
 briefly describes a contrast in theoretical and modeling schools that
has affected these debates very profoundly, and
 <a href="#AnatDeba">section 4</a>
 returns to the sites of several very confused and confusing,
occasionally heated debates and claims about &ldquo;the&rdquo; unit of
selection. Several leading positions on the issues are analyzed
utilizing the proposed taxonomy (or &ldquo;<em>anatomy</em>&rdquo;) of
distinct questions (Lloyd 1992; 2001; Griesemer 2005) while briefly
comparing this analysis to others. The identification and status of
these various units of selection, under these four meanings, is still
a very active area of disagreement and discussion in both biology and
philosophy (e.g., Okasha 2022; Su&aacute;rez &amp; Trivi&ntilde;o
2020; Su&aacute;rez &amp; Lloyd 2023).</p>

<p>
When Damuth and Heisler introduced their statistical tool to help
analyze units of selection in experiments, they wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We think that failure to distinguish the various alternative goals of
investigations of multilevel selection has both generated needless
controversy biological subdisciplines and has impeded unification of
the multilevel selection
 traditions.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 (1988: 409)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Our analysis in terms of the different &ldquo;schools&rdquo;
introduced in
 <a href="#TwoTradReseMultUndeUnitSele">section 3</a>
 is meant to aid such unification and mutual understanding. This
entry&rsquo;s analysis is not meant to resolve any of the conflicts
about which research questions are most worth pursuing; moreover,
there is no attempt to decide which of the questions or combinations
of questions discussed ought to be considered &ldquo;the&rdquo; units
of selection question in every context.</p>

<h2 id="FourBasiReseQues">2. Four Basic Research Questions</h2>

<p>
Four basic research questions (represented as &ldquo;RQs&rdquo; often,
throughout) are delineated as distinct and separable. These RQs may be
approached differently in the two schools or branches of multilevel
selection evolutionary theory, introduced in
 <a href="#TwoTradReseMultUndeUnitSele">section 3</a>.
 As shown in
 <a href="#AnatDeba">Section 4</a>,
 these questions are often used in combination to represent
&ldquo;the&rdquo; units of selection problem. In this Section, we
begin by clarifying terms. (See the entry on
 <a href="../biology-individual/">biological individuals</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
The term <em>replicator</em>, originally introduced in the 1970s as a
generalization of the <em>gene</em>, but since modified by
philosophers, is used to refer to any entity of which copies are made;
it plays a functional role in the selection process (Dawkins 1976,
1982a,b; Hull 1980; Brandon 1982; see
 <a href="#ReplReseQues">&sect;2.2</a>).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The original &ldquo;replicator&rdquo; was introduced along with the
term &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo;, defined as</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
any relatively discrete entity&hellip;which houses replicators, and
which can be regarded as a machine programmed to preserve and
propagate the replicators that ride inside it. (Dawkins 1982b:
295)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On this view, most replicators&rsquo; phenotypic effects are
represented in vehicles, which are themselves the proximate targets of
natural selection (Dawkins 1982a: 62).</p>

<p>
In the introduction of the term <em>interactor</em> in place of
<em>vehicle</em>, it was observed that the previous theory has
replicators interacting with their environments in two distinct ways:
they produce copies of themselves, and they may influence their own
survival and the survival of their copies through the production of
secondary products that ultimately may have phenotypic expression
(Hull 1980). The term &ldquo;interactor&rdquo; was suggested for the
entities that function in this second process. An <em>interactor
denotes that entity which interacts, as a cohesive whole, directly
with its environment in such a way that replication is
differential</em>&mdash;in other words, an entity on which selection
acts directly (Hull 1980: 318). The process of evolution by natural
selection is</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a process in which the differential extinction and proliferation of
interactors cause the differential perpetuation of the replicators
that produced
 them.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
 (Hull 1980: 318; see Brandon 1982: 317&ndash;318)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, however, theoreticians,
developmental evolutionary biologists, and philosophers thinking about
the origins of life expanded the application of the notion of
replication described by Dawkins and Hull, and introduced the concept
of &ldquo;reproducer&rdquo; as a generalization of the notion of
&ldquo;replicator&rdquo; (Griesemer 1998, 2000a,b,c; see discussion in
his 2005,
 2016<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>).</p>
 
<p>
In sum, &ldquo;the units of selection question&rdquo; is not a single
RQ at all, but rather, several distinct, functional, interrelated
RQs.</p>

<h3 id="InteReseQues">2.1 The Interactor Research Question</h3>

<p>
The interactor RQ, as introduced above, is: &ldquo;what organizational
level of units or entities are being actively, directly, selected in a
process of natural selection?&rdquo; Or, more traditionally: <em>An
interactor is an entity which interacts, as a cohesive whole, directly
with its environment in such a way that replication is
differential</em> (Hull 1980: 318). As such, this question appears in
the oldest forms of the units of selection debates (Darwin 1859;
Haldane 1932a,b; S. Wright *1931, *1945). In an early, very
influential review on &ldquo;units of selection&rdquo;, the purpose of
the article was stated: &ldquo;to contrast the levels of selection,
especially as regards their efficiency as causers of evolutionary
change&rdquo; (Lewontin 1970: 7). Similarly, others from the
Evolutionary Change school (see
 <a href="#TwoTradReseMultUndeUnitSele">&sect;3</a>),
 assumed that a unit of selection is something that &ldquo;responds to
selective forces as a unit&mdash;whether or not this corresponds to a
spatially localized deme, family, or population&rdquo; (Slobodkin
&amp; Rapoport 1974: 184).</p>

<p>
Questions about interactors focus on the description of the selection
process itself, that is, on the interaction between an entity, that
entity&rsquo;s traits, and its environment; these interactions are
studied through components of the entity&rsquo;s fitness and its
traits or properties, and on how this interaction may produce
evolutionary change. <em>They do not ordinarily focus on the adaptive
outcome of this process</em>. (Note that this applies especially to
the school of evolution called <em>Evolutionary Change</em>,
 <a href="#TwoTradReseMultUndeUnitSele">&sect;3</a>).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup>
 The interaction between some interactor at a certain level and its
environment is assumed to be mediated by &ldquo;traits&rdquo; that
affect the interactor&rsquo;s expected survival and reproductive
success, i.e., via some aspect of its fitness components of those
traits.</p>

<p>
Here, the possible and responsive answers to RQs about the interactor
include entities possibly at any level of biological organization,
including a lineage, a cluster of interacting species&mdash;such as a
symbiont or holobiont
 (<a href="#HoloDemi">&sect;4.6</a>),
 a species, a group, a kin-group, an organism, a gamete, a chromosome,
or an allele (Lewontin 1962, 1970; Brandon 1988; Lloyd 2017). Some
portion (or &lsquo;component&rsquo;) of the variance in the expected
reproductive success of the interactor is commonly expressed in terms
of the value of the trait and genotypic or genic (or other
reproducer-level) fitness parameters, that is, in terms of the fitness
of combinations of replicators or reproducers. Several technical
methods are available for expressing the relevant formal relationships
between interactor traits and (genotypic or reproducer) components of
trait fitness, including analysis of partial regression, as well as
variances, and covariances, discussed further in 4.1.</p>

<p>
As explained in the notes, partial regression analysis, i.e.,
contextual analysis, is most commonly applied today in studies of
interactors (that is, in Evolutionary Change school investigations of
plain interactors, without further investigation of the unit&rsquo;s
engineering adaptations per se, which is
 standard).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup>
 The early introducers of the contextual analysis tools remarked on
the valuable potential of contextual analysis for</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip; <em>empirically resolving</em> questions about the importance
of group selection in nature. The debate about group selection has
[thus far in 1987] relied primarily on <em>theoretical arguments about
the causal efficacy of particular group or individual characters</em>
that appeared to <em>be correlated with individual fitness</em>. After
two decades of speculation, contextual analysis could provide a means
for discussing the group-selection issue on a foundation of empirical
research. (Heisler &amp; Damuth 1987: 597).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This was prescient: empirical research from both laboratory, field,
and breeding experiments soon proved that group multilevel selection
of interactors was extremely effective at producing evolutionary
change (see summaries in: Wade &amp; Breden 1981; Goodnight &amp;
Stevens 1997; Muir 2005; Wade, Bijma, et al. 2010; Wade 2016;
Goodnight 2015).</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, it has sometimes been objected in the philosophical
literature debating units of selection that the notion of interactor
is <em>too vague</em> to be useful or applicable (both mistaken and
surprising, given the mathematical precision of the statistical
methods used for definition and identification); or that the
participating entity is not &ldquo;cohesive&rdquo; enough to play this
functional role in the selection process as assigned (e.g., Booth
2014; Bourrat 2019; Okasha 2022; see
 <a href="#UnitEvolTranIndi">&sect;4.5</a>,
 <a href="#HoloDemi">&sect;4.6</a>).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup></p>

<p>
But note that the researchers using the multilevel models cited above
discuss and model the functional role of interactor with very
significant precision, as an application of Hull&rsquo;s original
conception in terms of <em>cohesiveness</em> in interaction with their
environments, represented as &ldquo;emergent&rdquo; fitnesses in
relation to multilevel traits and environments that are traceable
through statistical tools such as a contextual analysis approach,
depending on the selective context (Lloyd 1988 [1994]; Brandon 1990,
contrast Sober &amp; Wilson 1998; Okasha 2006; see work of both
Adaptationist/KS and Evolutionary Change schools, especially
Goodnight, Bijma, Muir, Damuth and Heisler, and Wade; discussed
further in
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;&sect;4.1&ndash;4.6</a>).</p>
 
<p>
It is important to see that, in the midst of deciding among the
various methods for representing selection processes, these choices
have consequences for the empirical adequacy of the selection
 models.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
It is also extremely significant that the &ldquo;interactor research
question&rdquo; does not involve attributing engineering adaptations,
or &ldquo;benefits&rdquo; in the adaptive sense, sometimes accumulated
through selection over time, to the interactors, or indeed, to any
candidate unit of selection. Attributing interaction at a particular
level involves <em>only</em> the presence of an entity&rsquo;s trait
at that level with a special relation to genic, genotypic, replicator,
or reproducer expected success that is not reducible to interactions
at a lower level.</p>

<p>
As seen in
 <a href="#GrouSele">Sections 4.1&ndash;4.6</a>,
 the most common error made in interpreting many of the
interactor-based evolutionary models and model-types is that the
presence of an interactor at a level is taken to imply that the
interactor is <em>also</em> a manifestor of an adaptation at that
level. We will consider a couple of approaches to &ldquo;units of
selection&rdquo; in
 <a href="#GrouSele">Section 4.1</a>
 Group Selection, and
 <a href="#SpecSele">4.2</a>
 Species Selection, wherein a combination of interactor and manifestor
of adaptation functional evolutionary roles are merged from the very
start. This conflation of functional roles has also led to confusion
in the interpretations of evolutionary transitions
 (<a href="#UnitEvolTranIndi">&sect;4.5</a>),
 as well as holobionts
 (<a href="#HoloDemi">&sect;4.6</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="ReplReseQues">2.2 The Replicator/Reproducer Research Question</h3>

<p>
The &ldquo;replicator Research Question&rdquo; originally concerned
which organic entities met Dawkins&rsquo; definition besides the gene.
The subsequent, more widely used, meaning in philosophy of the term
was: &ldquo;an entity that passes on its structure directly in
replication&rdquo; (Hull 1980: 318). The term <em>replicator</em> is
used in this latter sense, henceforth.</p>

<p>
The issue corresponds to a long-standing debate in genetics about how
large a fragment of a genome ought to count as a
replicating/reproducing unit&mdash;something which can be treated
separately in evolutionary theory as inheriting traits of interactors
(Lewontin 1970; Hull 1980). This debate revolved around linkage
disequilibrium and led some biologists to advocate the use of
parameters of the entire haploid genome rather than of allele and
genotypic frequencies in genetical models, a view far ahead of its
time (Lewontin 1974).
 <sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>
 <sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup></p>

<p>
The basic point is that with much linkage disequilibrium, individual
genes cannot be considered as separately-acting replicators because
they do not behave as separate units during reproduction. Although
this debate remains pertinent to the choice of state space of
genetical model
 (<a href="#GeniSele">&sect;&sect;4.3&ndash;4.4</a>),
 it has been eclipsed by concerns about interactors in evolutionary
genetics.</p>

<p>
Significantly, recent developments in debates about units of selection
show that there has also been a profound reconception of the
evolution-by-selection process, which has rejected the original role
of replicator as misconceived, and too narrow in many circumstances.
In its place the role of &ldquo;reproducer&rdquo; is proposed, which
focuses on the <em>material transference</em> of genetic and other
matter, and its <em>development</em> from generation to generation
(Griesemer 1998, 2000a,b, 2003, 2005, 2014, 2016; see Forsdyke 2010;
 <a href="#TwoTradReseMultUndeUnitSele">&sect;3</a>,
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;4.1</a>,
 <a href="#UnitEvolTranIndi">&sect;4.5</a>,
 <a href="#HoloDemi">&sect;4.6</a>). On this approach, thinking in terms of
<em>reproducers</em> incorporates development into heredity and the
evolutionary process. It also incorporates both epigenetic and genetic
inheritance within the same framework, and includes the traditional
replicators as a subset (Griesemer 1998, 2000c, 2018). A more recent
and influential conflicting characterization of
&ldquo;reproducer&rdquo; disagrees about retroviral reproduction, and
what counts as a salient material bond between generations (Godfrey
Smith 2009, 2012; Griesemer 2016,
 2018).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Griesemer&rsquo;s functional role of evolutionary
reproducer&mdash;expanding the replicator&mdash;can play a central
role, along with a hierarchy of interactors, in work similarly
expanding the RQs framework into the units of evolutionary transition
(see
 <a href="#UnitEvolTranIndi">section 4.5</a>
 and the entries on
 <a href="../biology-individual/">biological individuals</a>,
 <a href="../macroevolution/">philosophy of macroevolution</a>, and
 <a href="../game-evolutionary/">evolutionary game theory</a>).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="ManiAdapReseQues">2.3 The Manifestor-of-Adaptation Research Question</h3>

<p>
At what level do adaptations occur? Or, &ldquo;When a population
evolves by natural selection, what, if anything, is the entity that
does the adapting?&rdquo; (Sober 1984: 204).</p>

<p>
The presence of adaptations at a given level of entity is sometimes
taken to be a requirement for something to be a <em>unit of
selection</em>, in addition to a usually-silent accompanying
requirement that it also be an evolutionary
 interactor.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-16" id="ref-16">16</a>]</sup>
 Moreover, an adaptation at a level is one important sort of
&ldquo;<em>benefit</em>&rdquo; for entities&mdash;whether organismic,
familial, or group&mdash;resulting from natural selection of those
entities at that level (G. C. Williams 1966).</p>

<p>
Significantly, though, multilevel, <em>Evolutionary Change</em> school
geneticists argued that group selection for &ldquo;group
advantage&rdquo; should be distinguished from the process of group
selection <em>per se</em>, that is, the sole process of selection of
interactors at the group or higher level (S. Wright 1980;
 <a href="#TwoTradReseMultUndeUnitSele">&sect;3</a>,
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;4.1</a>). In fact, the combination and blurring of the interactor
research question with the question of what entity has adaptations has
created a great deal of confusion in the units of selection debates in
general (see
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;&sect;4.1&ndash;4.6</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
(The distinction between interactor and manifestor-of-adaptation
functional roles has recently been more or less reintroduced by a
philosopher from the Adaptationist school [see
 <a href="#TwoTradReseMultUndeUnitSele">&sect;3</a>]
 in work on &ldquo;Type-1 agents&rdquo; in evolution by selection
(Okasha
 2018)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-17" id="ref-17">17</a>]</sup>.)</p>
 
<p>
Some of this confusion between interactor and manifestor of adaptation
is a result of a very important but neglected duality in the meaning
of evolutionary &ldquo;adaptation&rdquo; (in spite of discussions in
Brandon 1978, 1990; Burian 1983; Krimbas 1984; Sober 1984; Lewontin
1978; Munson 1971).</p>

<p>
Sometimes &ldquo;adaptation&rdquo; is taken&mdash;by both philosophers
and biologists&mdash;to signify any trait at all that is a direct
result or outcome of a selection process involving entities at that
level in the population. In this view, any trait that arises directly
from a selection process is claimed to be, by definition, an
adaptation, and I call this the &ldquo;selection-product&rdquo;
version of
 adaptation.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-18" id="ref-18">18</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Sometimes, on the other hand, the term &ldquo;adaptation&rdquo; is
reserved for traits that provide a &ldquo;better fit&rdquo; with the
environment through accumulated build-up of modifications in phenotype
that intuitively satisfy some notion of &ldquo;good design&rdquo; or
&ldquo;improved engineering&rdquo; that goes beyond the original range
of variation in the
 population.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-19" id="ref-19">19</a>]</sup>
 I call this second meaning the <em>engineering</em> definition of
adaptation, which is distinct, and sometimes, in tension with the
selection-product meaning of the term.</p>

<p>
Consider the famous peppered moth case: natural selection is acting on
the coloring of the moths, and the population evolves over time, but
no &ldquo;engineering&rdquo; adaptation emerges; that is, there has
been no &ldquo;accumulated change in&rdquo; phenotype that goes beyond
the original range of variation of the phenotype in the population.
Rather, the proportion of dark moths simply increases over time,
relative to the industrial environmental conditions, a clear case of
evolution by natural selection, on which a good fit to the environment
is reinforced. Note that the dark moths lie <em>within the range of
variation</em> of the ancestral population; they are simply more
frequent now, due to their superior fit with the changed
environment.</p>

<p>
The dark moths are a &ldquo;selection-product&rdquo; adaptation; there
has been no accumulated &ldquo;engineering&rdquo; of the form, nor
long-term change in the formation or function of any phenotypic trait.
Contrast this to the cases of Darwin&rsquo;s finches, in which
different species evolved distinct beak shapes specially adapted to
their diets of particular seeds (B. R. Grant &amp; P. R. Grant 1989;
P. R. Grant 1986). Natural selection here occurred against constantly
changing genetic and phenotypic backgrounds in which accumulated
selection processes had changed the shapes of the beaks, thus
producing &ldquo;engineering&rdquo; adaptations due to selection. The
finches now possess newly shaped beaks that are new mechanisms
<em>beyond the original range of variation</em> in the ancestral
population; see Su&aacute;rez &amp; Trivi&ntilde;o 2020 for cases of
holobionts as manifestors of adaptation).</p>

<p>
Some evolutionary biologists have strongly advocated an engineering
definition of adaptation (e.g., G. C. Williams 1966). The basic
alternative idea is that it is possible to have evolutionary change
result from direct selection favoring a trait <em>without</em> having
to consider that changed trait as an (engineering) adaptation, because
no accumulated phenotypic &ldquo;design&rdquo; change occurred; i.e.,
the entity is merely an interactor in the evolutionary
 process.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-20" id="ref-20">20</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
It is important to see how this biologically-based definition of
engineering adaptation differs from the philosophical definitions of
&ldquo;biological function&rdquo; usually on offer (see entries on
 <a href="../teleology-biology/">teleological notions in biology</a>
 and
 <a href="../adaptationism/">adaptationism</a>);
 I note that the accumulated, <em>engineering adaptation</em>
described here fits both prongs of the usual philosophical
choices.</p>

<p>
In his review of &ldquo;function&rdquo;, Colin Allen offers us the two
main philosophical accounts of the concept usually used when defining
evolutionary adaptation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Etiological approaches to function look to a causal-historical process
of selection; functions are identified with those past effects that
explain the current presence of a thing by means of a historical
selection process (typically natural selection in the case of
biological function).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>
Systems-analysis approaches invoke an ahistorical, engineering style
of analysis of a complex system into its components. Functions of
components are identified with their causal contributions to broader
capacities of the
 system.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-21" id="ref-21">21</a>]</sup>
 (C. Allen 2002: 375).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Significantly, both the engineering adaptations and selection-product
adaptations, introduced above, fall under Allen&rsquo;s first,
etiological approach to function; they both invoke the historical
selection process to explain the current presence of a trait. But the
engineering adaptations <em>also</em> appeal to design analyses often
identified with the systems-analysis notion of function, as well.
Thus, engineering adaptations&mdash;as the concept is used by leading
evolutionary biologists&mdash;appeal to <strong>both</strong>
etiological and systems-analysis approaches/definitions of function in
the philosophical senses just presented (Lloyd
 2021).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-22" id="ref-22">22</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Thus, we distinguish between selection and evolution of entities
through emergent fitnesses in relation to the phenotypic trait in the
context/environment [an interactor], and through emergent engineering
phenotypes acting as interactors [the manifestor of adaptation]. One
way to put the point, is that the interactor concept is
 adaptation-neutral.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-23" id="ref-23">23</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
In sum, when asking whether a given level of entity possesses
adaptations, it is necessary to state not only the level of selection
in question but also which notion of
adaptation&mdash;<em>selection-product</em> or
<em>engineering</em>&mdash;is being used. In fact, this question often
differs between the two schools of multilevel selection outlined in
 <a href="#TwoTradReseMultUndeUnitSele">Section 3</a>.</p>
 
<h3 id="BeneReseQues">2.4 The Beneficiary Research Question</h3>

<p>
Who benefits from a process of evolution by selection? There are two
common interpretations: Who benefits in the long term from such a
process? And who gets the benefit of possessing (engineering)
adaptations as a consequence of an evolution-by-selection process? As
we have addressed the latter question in
 <a href="#ManiAdapReseQues">&sect;2.3</a>,
 take the first, the issue of the &ldquo;ultimate
beneficiary&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
There are also two obvious answers to this question, i.e., ways of
characterizing the long-term beneficiaries of the
evolution-by-selection process. One might respond that the species or
lineages are the ultimate beneficiaries of the process.</p>

<p>
Alternatively, one might say that the lineages characterized on the
reproducer/replicator level, that is, the replicating alleles,
genomes, or reproducers, are the relevant long-term, or ultimate,
beneficiaries. I have not located any authors holding the first view,
but, for Dawkins, the latter interpretation is the <em>primary
fact</em> about evolution (1976; &Aring;gren 2021a). To arrive at this
conclusion, he adds the requirement of agency to the notion of
beneficiary (Hampe &amp; Morgan 1988). A beneficiary, by definition,
does not simply passively accrue credit in the long term; it must
function as the initiator of a causal pathway (Dawkins 1982a,b;
revived in Okasha 2018, <em>compare</em> manifestor). Under this
definition, the replicator as agent is causally responsible for all
the various effects that arise down the biochemical or phenotypic
pathway, irrespective of which entities might reap the long-term
rewards (Sapienza 2010).</p>

<p>
In some recent follow-up work on agency from a philosopher, mentioned
in
 <a href="#ManiAdapReseQues">&sect;2.3</a>,
 the evolutionary phenomenon focused on is agency of</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
type 1 [which] is a legitimate expression of adaptationism, but it
relies on a crucial presupposition. It presupposes that the entity
that is treated as an agent exhibits a
&ldquo;unity-of-purpose&rdquo;,&hellip; [i.e.,] its evolved traits
contribute to a single overall goal. (Okasha 2018: 5)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that both meanings of beneficiary distinguished above are
mobilized here: adaptationist goals and features of both traits and
genes.</p>

<p>
This second and quite distinct, &ldquo;ultimate&rdquo;, version of the
beneficiary question can be intertwined with the notion of adaptation.
The evolution-by-selection process may be said to
&ldquo;benefit&rdquo; a particular level of interactor, through
producing engineering adaptations at that level (e.g., G. C. Williams
1966; Maynard Smith 1976; Eldredge 1985; Vrba 1984).</p>

<p>
It is crucial to distinguish the research question concerning the
level at which engineering adaptations evolve and accumulate from a
selection process,
 (<a href="#ManiAdapReseQues">&sect;2.3</a>),
 from the question about the identity of the ultimate beneficiaries of
that selection process in the Dawkins sense, as here
 (<a href="#BeneReseQues">&sect;2.4</a>).
 One can think that interactors have adaptations without thinking that
those interactors are the &ldquo;ultimate beneficiaries&rdquo; of the
selection
 process.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-24" id="ref-24">24</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="Summ">2.5 Summary</h3>

<p>
Four distinct research questions have been isolated and identified, in
this Section, that have appeared under the rubric of
&ldquo;<em>the</em> units of selection question&rdquo; in evolutionary
theory and practice: What is the <em>interactor</em>? What is the
<em>reproducer</em>, or more narrowly constrained <em>replicator</em>?
What entity <em>manifests</em> accumulated, engineering,
<em>adaptations</em> resulting from evolution by selection at a level
of biological organization? And what is the ultimate
<em>beneficiary</em>? There is an important ambiguity in the meaning
of <em>adaptation</em>; which meaning is in play has had significant
consequences for both the group selection and species selection
debates (see
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;4.1</a>,
 <a href="#SpecSele">&sect;4.2</a>).</p>

<p>
Below, the anatomy and applications of this collection of RQs along
with their possible and responsive answers, all included under a
&ldquo;units of selection&rdquo; framework, are analyzed and reviewed.
Identifying which specific meaning(s) of the level and unit of
selection is being used, alone or in combination, in evolutionary
discussions and models, both formal and informal, is a useful initial
approach for thinking about both theoretical and experimental research
into natural selection processes. When applying this &ldquo;logic of
research
 questions&rdquo;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-25" id="ref-25">25</a>]</sup>
 analytical method like this&mdash;that is, clarifying the variety of
RQs in a controversy, and carefully specifying their possible and
responsive answers within their wider scientific (as well as social
and cultural, although those are not emphasized here) frameworks and
contexts. The method is conceived as a tool that integrates knowledge
and theory in evolution with the empirical, experimental, practice
side of the science. It simultaneously also frames the adaptationist
research approach in contrast with other research approaches in
evolutionary theory. This &ldquo;anatomy&rdquo; framework combined
with the &ldquo;logic of research questions&rdquo; tool or analysis,
is a clear way to understand how the expression &ldquo;unit of
selection&rdquo; is used in the many different research contexts in
which it appears.</p>

<p>
Ironically, these same three or four functional evolutionary roles,
introduced, defined, and distinguished decades ago (see comprehensive
analysis of leading approaches to units in Griesemer
 2005<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-26" id="ref-26">26</a>]</sup>),
 have since been reintroduced or resurrected by a number of different
authors under different names and terminology, but in relation to the
same or similar debates about units (e.g., Bourrat 2016, 2019,
2021a,b, 2022; Bourrat &amp; Griffiths 2018; Clarke 2016; Stencel
&amp; Wloch-Salamon 2018; Godfrey-Smith 2009, 2016; Doolittle &amp;
Booth 2017; Doolittle &amp; Inkpen 2018; Inkpen &amp; Doolittle 2021;
Lean et al. 2022; Birch 2020; Booth 2014; Okasha 2018, 2022; Gardner
2015a,b,c). It is &ldquo;ironic&rdquo;, because these same newer
analyses either explicitly reject or neglect the full functional and
formal role analysis&mdash;or some representation of
such&mdash;offered
 earlier.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-27" id="ref-27">27</a>]</sup>
 A couple of these re-introductions of needed distinctions are
discussed in
 <a href="#AnatDeba">Section 4</a>
 (e.g., Okasha 2022; Doolittle &amp; Booth 2017 and Stencel &amp;
Wloch-Salamon 2018: Section 4.6; see Su&aacute;rez &amp; Lloyd 2023
for further
 analyses).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-28" id="ref-28">28</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Finally, the claim that two meanings of &ldquo;unit of
selection&rdquo; are <em>distinct</em> does not imply that they cannot
be interrelated&mdash;that is not the claim here&mdash;or that one
living being or part cannot simultaneously satisfy two or more
functional evolutionary roles; in fact, we often see this (discussed
further in
 <a href="#AnatDeba">&sect;4</a>).</p>
 
<p>
In any case, commenting on the four-pronged &ldquo;anatomy&rdquo;
analysis of the debates over units of selection, John Maynard Smith
wrote in <em>Evolution</em>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[Lloyd 2001] argues, correctly I believe, that much of the confusion
has arisen because the same terms have been used with different
meanings by different authors &hellip; [but] I fear that the
confusions she mentions will not easily be ended. (Maynard Smith 2001:
1497)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In
 <a href="#AnatDeba">Section 4</a>,
 a dissection of this anatomy of research questions is used to clarify
some of the most visible positions in six debates:
 (<a href="#GrouSele">4.1</a>)
 group selection;
 (<a href="#SpecSele">4.2</a>)
 species selection;
 (<a href="#GeniSele">&sect;4.3</a>)
 genic selection;
 (<a href="#GeniPlur">&sect;4.4</a>)
 genic pluralism;
 (<a href="#UnitEvolTranIndi">4.5</a>)
 units of evolutionary transitions in individuality (ETI) and
 (<a href="#HoloDemi">4.6</a>)
 holobionts and demibionts. But first we must discuss an extremely
influential but usually unrecognized bifurcation in the theory and
practices of evolutionary multilevel theory in
 <a href="#TwoTradReseMultUndeUnitSele">Section 3</a>.</p>
 
<h2 id="TwoTradReseMultUndeUnitSele">3. Two Traditions of Research into Multilevel Understanding of Units/Levels of Selection</h2>

<p>
There is a high-level
 analysis,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-29" id="ref-29">29</a>]</sup>
 that whereas kin selection research questions aim primarily at
<em>identifying character states and genic/ kin selection processes
that maximize fitness,</em> multilevel and group selection methods aim
to understand the <em>effects of selection on interactor trait changes
over time</em> (Goodnight 2013, 2015; Wade 2016; Maynard Smith 1974,
1976, 1987, 2001; Futuyma &amp; Kirkpatrick 2017). Here, we introduce
both research approaches and priorities. But first, we need some basic
tools for our discussion.</p>

<p>
As argued and illustrated by several philosophers many decades ago,
the structure of evolutionary theory itself may be best understood as
an interrelated family of <em>informal and formal model-types</em> or
model outlines (Beatty 1980; Lloyd 1983 (proposing informal
model-outlines or model-types of Darwinian theory; <em>contra</em>
Godfrey Smith&rsquo;s (2007: 731) rejection of the &ldquo;semantic
view&rdquo; of scientific theories, explanation, and confirmation, on
the basis that it necessitated &ldquo;mathematization&rdquo;, which it
did not when Beatty and Lloyd used it to analyze Darwin&rsquo;s
informal models), nor later in Lloyd&rsquo;s 1988 informal models of
species selection, applied in Lloyd and Gould 1993 (see
 <a href="#SpecSele">&sect;4.2</a>
 below); 1984 (analysis of formal genetics models; Lloyd 1988[1994]
(arguing for seeing evolutionary biology in terms of families of
informal models of organismic, species selection, and group selection
models, as well as formal models of population genetics and
quantitative genetics of organismic and higher level selection, using
the semantic view); Griesemer 1984, (informal and formal evolutionary
model-types, using semantic view and their
&ldquo;presentations&rdquo;, congruent with Godfrey Smith&rsquo;s
later model &ldquo;construals&rdquo;, 2007); Griesemer 1991, 2013;
Thompson 1989; Ketcham 2018; and biologists Wade &amp; Kalisz 1990;
Wagner et al. 2014). Philosophers Downes 1992; and Weisberg 2012, also
endorsed a formal and informal model-based approach to evolutionary
biology, under different names. One key agreement among <em>all</em>
of the above past and present participants in model-based analyses of
evolutionary theory, and many more, is that it can be understood as an
interrelated group of formal and informal evolutionary models and
model-types, where a model-outline or <strong>model-type</strong> is
defined as a basic structure whose shared formal or informal
parameters and variables may not all have been assigned values in a
given
 application.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-30" id="ref-30">30</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
This is all significant for our analysis of units of selection because
it is needed to grasp that the basic model-types used by the two
different schools we are about to examine are fundamentally used
differently in significant ways, and are usually used to answer
different research questions (RQs) in evolutionary research.</p>

<p>
One more key distinction must be emphasized before proceeding. As
discussed in
 <a href="#InteReseQues">&sect;2.1</a>,
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;&sect;4.1&ndash;4.6</a>, <em>interactors</em> are characterized primarily by
their cohesive responses/interactions with (i.e., when they
&ldquo;interact as a whole with&rdquo;) their environments, both
biotic and abiotic (see
 <a href="#InteReseQues">&sect;2.1</a>,
 <a href="#TwoTradReseMultUndeUnitSele">&sect;3</a>,
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;&sect;4.1&ndash;4.6</a>).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-31" id="ref-31">31</a>]</sup>
 As we will see below repeatedly, they are very significantly
distinguished from <em>manifestors-of-adaptation</em>
 (<a href="#ManiAdapReseQues">&sect;2.3</a>,
 <a href="#TwoTradReseMultUndeUnitSele">&sect;3</a>,
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;&sect;4.1&ndash;4.6</a>;
 see McKenna et al. 2021; Lloyd 1988 [1994]; G.C. Williams 1992).
Specifically, any &ldquo;<em>cohesiveness</em>&rdquo; in the
activities/traits the interactors may exhibit while in these holistic
interactions, does <em>not necessarily yield</em>
&ldquo;emergent&rdquo; engineering adaptations, more widely understood
by philosophers as etiological and systems &ldquo;functions&rdquo;
(see definitions in
 <a href="#ManiAdapReseQues">&sect;2.3</a>,
 also see
 <a href="#TwoTradReseMultUndeUnitSele">&sect;3</a>,
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;4.1</a>,
 <a href="#SpecSele">&sect;4.2</a>).
 Also please note that Lewontin&rsquo;s original 3-part
&ldquo;recipe&rdquo; for a unit of selection to evolve, upon which so
much discussion is based, does not mention or include engineering
adaptation concepts or results as central. It involves only
interactors, as written, even while many, if not most of some
sub-communities of,evolutionary researchers are motivated to seek out
adaptations of distinct units of selection.</p>

<p>
Instead, a standard for a manifestor of adaptation must also be
established and explored separately, usually through game theory or
other forms of exploring optimality, a notion from engineering and
design. The genetics models are then produced separately, needed to
produce or maintain the optima, as we shall see below.</p>

<h3 id="EvolChanSchoMultEvol">3.1 Evolutionary Change School of Multilevel Evolution</h3>

<p>
Multilevel selection methods for model-building and detection of
interactors, such as contextual analysis
 (<a href="#InteReseQues">&sect;2.1</a>,
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;4.1</a>,
 <a href="#SpecSele">&sect;4.2</a>)
 and multilevel
 modeling,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-32" id="ref-32">32</a>]</sup>
 arising out of the quantitative genetics tradition, are used to
describe the evolutionary processes acting on a population in its
current state of traits or fitness; the focus is on evolutionary
processes, <em>in contrast to</em> searching for or modeling which
level entity might be a manifestor of
 adaptation.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-33" id="ref-33">33</a>]</sup>
 This is often called the &ldquo;Evolutionary Change&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Wrightian&rdquo; school, because of its interest in Sewall
Wright&rsquo;s work on evolution in structured populations, and its
emphasis on the effects of epistasis and gene interaction (see
below).</p>

<p>
Wright found that when populations are subdivided into smaller groups
or demes, as many actual biological populations are, this population
structure challenges the Fisherian modeling assumption of panmixia
(freely mixed, random mating) in the metapopulation (collection of all
demes). For example, the evolutionary response to selection on a given
combination of genes <em>within</em> a deme depends on the overall
migration patterns (e.g., Slatkin 1981b; Uyenoyama &amp; Feldman 1980)
and rates within the metapopulation, as well as on the
<em>interactions of genes</em> within the demes.</p>

<p>
Griffing (1967) highlighted the social or competitive <em>effects</em>
organisms have on each other, because when these effects have a
genetic component, they provide an additional source of heritable
genetic variation within the population.</p>

<p>
These effects and processes are referred to as &ldquo;indirect genetic
effects&rdquo; (IGEs) (Moore, Brodie, &amp; Wolf 1997; Wolf, Brodie et
al. 1998; Wolf, Brodie, &amp; Wade 2000) or &ldquo;associative
effects&rdquo; (Griffing 1967; Muir 2005). They have the potential to
accelerate, slow, or even reverse an evolutionary response to
 selection.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-34" id="ref-34">34</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Moreover, traits of an individual&rsquo;s social environment, such as
the aggressiveness of an ant or bee colony when foraging, can directly
influence behavior (Sih &amp; Watters 2005; Westneat 2012), and impose
multilevel
 selection.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-35" id="ref-35">35</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Hence, modern Evolutionary Change theorists tend to <strong>emphasize
the importance of epistasis and IGEs, which are <em>explicitly,
deliberately, excluded</em> in the Adaptationist methods and models,
although they are essential to higher levels of <em>both</em>
selection and engineering adaptation</strong> (Bijma 2010a,b, 2011,
2014; Bijma, Hulst, &amp; de Jong 2022; Breden &amp; Wade 1991; Wade
2016; Goodnight 2014 (see Other Internet Resources), 2015; contrast,

<h3 id="AdapSeleSchoMultEvol">3.2 Adaptationist/Kin Selection School of Multilevel Evolution</h3>

<p>
Kin selection (KS) and inclusive fitness genic
 model-types<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-37" id="ref-37">37</a>]</sup>
 arose primarily out of game theory, evolutionary stable strategies
(ESS), and classic Fisherian mass genetics, and are used to identify
the optimal solution[s] to particular adaptive questions. This
research practice is thus usefully labeled the
&ldquo;Adaptationist&rdquo; approach to multilevel evolution
(Goodnight 2015), due to its focus on locating interactors that are
<em>also</em> engineering adaptations. The goals are to explain both
functional roles&mdash;interactor and manifestor of
adaptation&mdash;by representing them with KS/inclusive fitness genic
models.</p>

<p>
Any typical Adaptationist/kin selection/inclusive fitness (referred to
often below as <em>Adaptationist/KS</em>) school multilevel RQ
embodies, at best, <em>two</em> interdependent research questions:</p>

<p>
First RQ: Identify an equilibrium or optimal trait at a given level of
organization which is an engineering adaptation (often done using
engineering-style optimality modeling, see Oster &amp; Wilson 1978;
Gardner &amp; Welch
 2011.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-38" id="ref-38">38</a>]</sup>)
 and which is <em>unlikely</em> to evolve by selection of the
lower-level entity traits. The paradigms are &ldquo;altruistic&rdquo;
or &ldquo;self-sacrificing&rdquo; traits at the lower level, lowering
self-fitness, but which are &ldquo;good for the group&rdquo; or
higher-level fitness.</p>

<p>
Second, co-ordinated RQ: Characterize a KS or inclusive fitness/genic
selection process in which this engineering higher-level-optimal
adaptation <em>could</em> have evolved, <em>against</em> the pressures
of the lower-level entities&rsquo; selective processes.</p>

<p>
For example, Gardner &amp; Welch, operating within this
Adaptationist/KS school, claim that their simpler, genic-oriented
models provide good <em>justification for excluding</em> the
non-additive genotypic effects we just discussed in the previous
section concerning the Evolutionary Change school&mdash;the <em>very
same interactions</em> that drive both upper-level selection, and any
adaptation that might occur, in the Evolutionary Change multilevel
selection models&mdash;because such effects &ldquo;show no
correspondence with the optimization program&rdquo; (2011: 1809),
i.e., with the Adaptationist search for optimal gene&rsquo;s-eye
solutions.</p>

<p>
Thus, while they acknowledge that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
neglect of these epistatic effects will lead to a less complete (and
potentially <em>quite inaccurate</em>) account of the evolutionary
<em>process</em> (&hellip;) the gene&rsquo;s eye view <em>does</em>
function adequately <em>as a theory of adaptation</em>. (2011: 1809;
emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is often this conflict of priorities&mdash;between searching for
<em>optimal adaptations</em> from the gene&rsquo;s-eye view&mdash;vs.
searching <em>for accurate accounts of evolutionary
processes</em>&mdash;that plays a central role in the tensions between
the two research schools. We shall discuss examples of these
contrasting RQs in
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;4.1</a>,
 <a href="#UnitEvolTranIndi">&sect;4.5</a> &amp;
 <a href="#HoloDemi">&sect;4.6</a>.</p>
 
<h3 id="RelaBetwAdapEvolChanSchoMultEvol">3.3 Relationships Between Adaptationist/KS and Evolutionary Change Schools of Multilevel Evolution</h3>

<p>
As Wade and Goodnight summarize the biggest contrasts between the
Adaptationist/KS (Fisherian) and Evolutionary Change (Wrightian)
schools in evolution, an analysis using the &ldquo;Logic and
pragmatics of Research Questions&rdquo; tells us that, not only do the
two approaches address different <em>RQs</em>, seeking different
<em>possible and responsive answers</em> to those RQs (Lloyd 2015;
see, e.g., Goodnight 2000), but they also make a variety of different
assumptions in building their model-types in addressing those RQs:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip;the Wright-Fisher controversy involves the fundamental nature
of evolutionary change&hellip;[including] its genetic basis (universal
epistasis and pleiotropy vs. additive genetic effects), the ecological
context in which it takes place (small, subdivided populations vs.
large, panmictic populations), and the mechanisms by which it operates
(local, mass selection, random genetic drift, and interdemic selection
vs. mutation and mass selection). (Wade &amp; Goodnight 1998:
1547)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, the two research approaches to multilevel selection founded on
these two distinct schools&rsquo;
 model-types<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-39" id="ref-39">39</a>]</sup>
 are not at all the same, because they simply do not ask the same RQs,
nor use similar model components, values, or
 assumptions<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-40" id="ref-40">40</a>]</sup>
 (Goodnight 2000, 2013, 2015; Linksvayer &amp; Wade 2005; Wade 2016;
Wade &amp; Kalisz 1990; Rousset 2004; Ketcham
 2018).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-41" id="ref-41">41</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Rather than being competing approaches, as they have often been
treated since the 1960s, the two research schools may today be
considered complementary approaches that, when used together, give a
clearer picture of social evolution and multilevel theory and genetics
than either one can when used in isolation, although there are sound
reasons for preferring one approach over another in certain background
conditions and population structures (Goodnight 2013: 1547; 2015; Wade
2016). In summing up their analysis, biologists Kramer and Meunier
write:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The two theories thus provide different perspectives that might be
fruitfully combined to promote our understanding of the evolution in
group-structured populations. (Kramer &amp; Meunier 2016:
abstract)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But many researchers from the Adaptationist/KS school hold less
tolerant attitudes than seeing this &ldquo;fruitful combination&rdquo;
towards the multilevel selection models&mdash;concerned primarily with
process&mdash;rather than their preferred objective of optimal fitness
traits/engineering
 adaptations.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-42" id="ref-42">42</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
We shall see, in
 <a href="#GrouSele">sections 4.1&ndash;4.6</a>,
 how approaching RQs using one rather than the other research
framework and model-types to multilevel selection makes a difference
in outcomes.</p>

<h2 id="AnatDeba">4. The Anatomy of the Debates</h2>

<h3 id="GrouSele">4.1 Group Selection</h3>

<p>
The legendary near-deathblow in the 1960s to group panselectionism was
really about group <em>benefit</em>, not group selection per se (G. C.
Williams 1966). The interest was in cases of a genuine group selection
(GS, often, henceforth) process among groups, where the groups also,
as a whole, <em>benefited</em> <em>from</em> organism-level traits
(including behaviors) that seemed disadvantageous to the organism
(Wynne Edwards 1962; G. C. Williams 1966; Maynard Smith 1964). But
frequently, a group benefit was not necessarily a group engineering
adaptation
 (<a href="#ManiAdapReseQues">&sect;2.3</a>,
 <a href="#BeneReseQues">&sect;2.4</a>; G. C. Williams 1966; Brandon 1981, 1985; Brandon &amp;
Burian 1984; Sober &amp; Wilson
 1998).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-43" id="ref-43">43</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Implicit in this discussion of GS processes, is the assumption that
being a &ldquo;unit of selection&rdquo; at the group level requires
<em>two</em> distinct, interrelated but separable evolutionary
functions or roles: (1) having the group as an interactor, and (2)
having a group-level engineering-type adaptation accumulated from a
group selection process. Thus, the entire discussion confuses and
combines two distinct RQs, the interactor question and the
manifestor-of-adaptation questions, calling this combined set
<em>the</em> &ldquo;unit of selection&rdquo; question (true for both
critics, G. C. Williams 1966; Maynard Smith 1964; and defender, Wynne
Edwards 1962; see Borrello 2010).</p>

<p>
Thus, the GS issue was understood to hinge on &ldquo;whether entities
more inclusive than organisms exhibit adaptations&rdquo;. (Hull 1980:
 325;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-44" id="ref-44">44</a>]</sup>
 Maynard Smith 1976; Ramsey &amp; Brandon 2011) Similarly,
paleontological approaches required engineering adaptations combined
with interactors, for species and lineages to count as units of
selection
 (<a href="#SpecSele">&sect;4.2</a>).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-45" id="ref-45">45</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Finally, in an argument meant to distinguish GS and kin selection (KS
henceforth), it was argued that GS is favored by small group size, low
migration rates, and rapid extinction of groups infected with a
selfish
 allele;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-46" id="ref-46">46</a>]</sup>
 thus, the ultimate test of the group selection hypothesis will be
whether populations having these characteristics tend to show
&ldquo;self-sacrificing&rdquo; or &ldquo;prudent&rdquo; behavior more
commonly than those which do
 not.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-47" id="ref-47">47</a>]</sup>
 (Maynard Smith 1976: 282; see Wade 1980a,b, 1985 on kin
selection)</p>

<p>
Contrary to Adaptationist/KS school theoreticians, Evolutionary Change
biologists have produced a wide variety of models, lab, and field
experiments that violate <em>all</em> of the Adaptationist/KS
school&rsquo;s &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; conditions usually cited for GS
to be effective (Matessi &amp; Jayakar 1976: 384; Wade &amp; McCauley
1980: 811; Boorman 1978: 1909; Uyenoyama 1979; Uyenoyama &amp; Feldman
1980; Wade 1976, 1977, 1978, reviewed in 2016; contrast, e.g., Maynard
Smith 1964, 1976).</p>

<p>
That different researchers reach such disparate conclusions about the
<em>theoretical</em> efficacy of GS is largely because they are
responding to different RQs, using different model-types with
different parameters, and different assumptions from different
schools. That they make vastly different generalizations about
biological <em>facts</em> has to do, rather, more with ignorance of
Evolutionary Change school experiments and findings (e.g., Gardner
&amp; Grafen 2009; Gardner 2015a; West, El Mouden, &amp; Gardner 2011;
compare Wade 1996, 2016; Goodnight 2015; see below).</p>

<p>
For example, many Adaptationist/KS model-types use a specific
migration mechanism: they assume that migrating individuals mix
completely, forming a &ldquo;migrant pool&rdquo; from which migrants
are assigned to the future generation randomly. Under this approach,
small sample size is needed to get a large genetic variance between
populations (Wade 1978: 110; 2016; Slatkin 1981b; Okasha 2006).</p>

<p>
In fact, Evolutionary Change models and empirical studies all
established that <em>there are many different ways for a group to
reproduce, giving rise to <strong>many different
entities</strong>&mdash;e.g., propagules, not just genic
reproducers&mdash;playing the functional role of reproducers</em> in
models in which groups are interactors and manifestors of
 adaptation.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-48" id="ref-48">48</a>]</sup>
 This is very different from the gene&rsquo;s eye view where
heritability is strongly tied to gene-level variation (Wade 2016).
When comparing kin/genic selection with group/multilevel selection
model-types and their assumptions&mdash;e.g., the facts about spread
of phenotypes&mdash;through either migration or reproduction, the
devil is in the details.</p>

<p>
This is evident in an early, very controversial case focusing on group
<em>vs.</em> organismic selection of a virus. Focusing only on the
evolutionary interactors, using an Evolutionary Change approach, helps
clarify theoretical, methodological, and pragmatic issues that infuse
GS
 debates.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-49" id="ref-49">49</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The <em>Myxoma</em> virus was introduced into Australia because it was
highly fatal to the out-of-control rabbit population. After some
years, however, the rabbits had become resistant, and the virus had
become less virulent. The debate focused on whether the avirulence of
the virus had evolved primarily from organismic or group selection. It
was a challenging problem because both model-types produced the same
outcome: decreased virulence (Fenner 1965). In the models, <em>mixed
groups</em> with more virulent viruses inoculated into the rabbits
spread fewer virulent viruses in the metapopulations of groups, and
<em>pure</em> groups of a single type of very virulent virus particles
also reproduced less well in the metapopulation, thus producing lower
levels of virulence in either case. Both biologists and philosophers
took firm stances, claiming either that organismic selection (Futuyma
1979; Alexander &amp; Borgia 1978; Gilpin 1975), or group selection
(Lewontin 1970; S. Levin &amp; Pimentel 1981; Sober 1984; Sober &amp;
Wilson 1998) was responsible for the observed avirulence.</p>

<p>
In a philosophical analysis, it was highlighted that we did not know
enough to actually <em>decide</em> this debate about GS (Lloyd 1986,
1988[1994]). Researchers did not agree about the facts regarding the
composition of the inoculations of viruses injected: were they
homogeneous or heterogeneous&mdash;all virulent, benign, or mixed? If
the inoculated virus groups were observed to be heterogeneous, then it
would be possible to apply appropriate statistical examination to
them, as would be expected in the Evolutionary Change approach to
GS.</p>

<p>
An aspect of the debate about the efficacy of group-level interactors
that has received a great deal of consideration in both biology and
philosophy, concerns the conceptual and statistical tools necessary
for identifying an interactor, as mentioned in
 <a href="#InteReseQues">Section 2.1</a>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-50" id="ref-50">50</a>]</sup>
 It was proposed to look for genetic or reproducer interaction at the
lower level of entities, and coordinated, &ldquo;emergent&rdquo;
fitness&mdash;i.e., relations among the entities, traits (characters),
environmental contexts, and fitnesses&mdash;at the upper level of
 entities.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-51" id="ref-51">51</a>]</sup>
 Today, such statistical and causal examination uses precisely such
contextual analysis in actual multilevel studies (Arnold &amp;
Fristrup 1982; Griesemer &amp; Wade 1988; Goodnight 2015; see Bijma
2014 and Wade 2016 for theoretical context). Contextual analysis
produces a multilevel multiple partial regression analysis. Earnshaw
summarizes its products nicely:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(w \mathbin{\Delta} z = a\,\textrm{Var} (Z) +b\, \textrm{Var} (z)\),
where \(a\) and \(b\) are partial regression coefficients: is the
average linear effect of group character on individual fitness when
individual character is held constant, and \(b\) is the average linear
effect of individual character on individual fitness holding group
character constant. (2015: 306)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The higher and lower-level characters are treated as independently
having their causal effects on fitness, and they are combined with
variances in lower and upper-level characters, to give a change in the
organismic (or group) characters. Once such an analysis is
done&mdash;and only then&mdash;can we state what entity-types
<em>might</em> be acting as an interactor at a particular level, and
explore them causally, in the process. As Damuth and Heisler claimed,
their method does not help answer questions about units of selection
except
 empirically.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-52" id="ref-52">52</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The key issue highlighted in the Myxoma case was that at the time of
the above discussion, no one knew what the composition of the groups
was, so no contextual or other statistical analysis could be performed
to decide the
 case.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-53" id="ref-53">53</a>]</sup>
 Yet G. C. Williams had discouraged <em>gathering</em> such
information using his widely accepted and promulgated &ldquo;principle
of parsimony&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In explaining adaptations, one should assume the adequacy of the
simplest form of natural selection, that of alternative alleles in
Mendelian populations, <em>unless the evidence clearly shows that the
theory does not suffice</em>. (G. C. Williams 1966: 55; emphasis
added).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The following crucial problem with Williams&rsquo; principle was made
clear: by highlighting the proposed emergent fitness/trait relational
definition of an interactor (e.g., applying the suggested additivity
criterion using contextual analysis), it</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
reveals the potential for dogmatic abuse of such sensible-looking
advice. &ldquo;The evidence&rdquo;, as Williams puts it, is not found,
it is created. Not performing analyses of group composition and
contribution to the global gene pool virtually guarantees&hellip;that
no evidence will be found that will reveal the inadequacy of the
simpler&hellip;. [genic or organismic level] models&hellip;.
Understanding the structure of selection models and the information
needed to perform an adequate comparison reveals quite clearly the
dogmatism of Williams&rsquo; maxim, as it is usually applied. (Lloyd
1988 [1994: 95])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This critique of G. C. Williams&rsquo; parsimony principle and the
resulting insistence to obtain the empirical information necessary to
perform the needed contextual statistical and causal analyses to
answer the question about which entity was an <em>interactor</em> in
this context, was, perhaps surprisingly, welcomed by G. C. Williams,
citing the above page numbers, when he reviewed the quoted book in the
<em>Quarterly Review of Biolog</em>y: he described Lloyd&rsquo;s
analysis of group selection in this case as &ldquo;mak[ing] more sense
than any other I have seen&rdquo; (G. C. Williams 1990: 504).</p>

<p>
The proposed Evolutionary Change school-style theoretical,
methodological and pragmatic requirements for something to be a
recognized instance of GS&mdash;where groups are interpreted <em>as
interactors alone</em>, and <em>not necessarily manifestors</em> of
adaptation, as Williams had previously required&mdash;were thus
<strong><em>accepted</em></strong> <em>by the original arch-critic of
group selection</em>. The crucial distinction between the functional
evolutionary roles of interactor and manifestor was subsequently used
in Williams&rsquo; own work (1992) on hierarchical species and lineage
 selection.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-54" id="ref-54">54</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
These roles are subsequently conflated again by philosophers Okasha
and Paternotte (2012), who give a persuasive analysis of how to
identify an evolutionary interactor, much like the above, using
contextual analysis plus a linked causal analysis, as recommended by
Damuth and Heisler (1988), but conclude&mdash;under an
Adaptationist/KS school approach&mdash;that they have identified an
<em>adaptation</em> of the original Williams-<em>engineering</em>
 variety.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-55" id="ref-55">55</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Notably, phenotypic traits involved in group selection processes of
interactors are often (usually) <em>not</em> optimal or engineering
adaptations of the entities at that upper level, but rather simply
selection-product adaptations following from their being interactors
at that
 level.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-56" id="ref-56">56</a>]</sup>
 The fact that this feature of Evolutionary Change models is also
called &ldquo;adaptation&rdquo; has sometimes proved confusing to many
(Sober &amp; Wilson 1998; see Lloyd 2008 correspondence with Sober and
D. S. Wilson on this issue; Wade 2016; Gordon
 2014).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-57" id="ref-57">57</a>]</sup>
 But contextual analysis is a good method for answering research
questions about <em>both</em> Adaptationist/KS and Evolutionary Change
<em>interactors</em> at any given
 level.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-58" id="ref-58">58</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The outcomes of group selection models can also be destructive (but
still, selected) traits. Consider, for example, very common phenomena
that Wade highlighted as almost completely neglected by the
Adaptationist/KS school: these damaging population consequences of
artificial and commercial breeding have</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
received much less theoretical or empirical attention, even though it
is the most common situation in the domestication of plants and
animals, (Wade 2016: 18)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He cites experimental and field results regarding selection and
group-harmful traits, e.g.: cannibalism in flour beetles (Wade 1980b);
field work on cannibalism in willow leaf beetle (Breden &amp; Wade
1989); leaf area in plants (Goodnight 1985); egg laying in hens (Muir
1996); and eusocial mortality in hens (Ellen et al. 2008). Wade
concludes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The results of these studies leave little doubt that artificial group
selection can curb the evolution of traits <em>good for the individual
but harmful to the group</em>. (2016: 18&ndash;19; emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is easy to see, in this context, how the requirements for the roles
of multilevel interactors, and multilevel manifestors of engineering
adaptation, may be conflated and confused. In fact, Heisler and Damuth
themselves <em>did not make the relevant distinction</em>, citing
Sober&rsquo;s (1984) two-pronged, conflated,
interactor-plus-manifestor, &ldquo;common
 fate&rdquo;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-59" id="ref-59">59</a>]</sup>
 definition of group selection as equivalent to their approach
(Heisler &amp; Damuth 1987:
 588).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-60" id="ref-60">60</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Let us take another look at Heisler and Damuth&rsquo;s contextual
analysis, and the Price Eqs. Overall, while many of the suggested
techniques to identify interactors have had strengths, no single
approach to this aspect of the interactor question has been generally
accepted across all researchers working from <em>both</em> schools of
evolution, and indeed it remains the subject of debate in biological
and philosophical circles, perhaps partly because the Adaptationist
school, as well as many philosophers, largely prefer one
method&mdash;using the Price equations&mdash;while the Evolutionary
Change school prefers a different one&mdash;using multiple regression
analyses, in the form of contextual analyses for any and all modeling
methods and applications in the field and laboratory experiments
(Gardner &amp; Grafen 2009; Gardner 2015a,b,c; Grafen 2009; Queller
1992; Goodnight 2015; see discussions in Wade 1995, Price 1970, 1972;
Heisler &amp; Damuth 1987; Damuth &amp; Heisler 1988; Okasha 2006;
Earnshaw 2015; Goodnight 2015. 2020; Wade 2016; Ketcham 2018; contrast
Bourrat 2021a,b).</p>

<p>
Let us take a moment to consider the notion that perhaps these
differences in statistical tool use have consequences for the
foundational understanding, especially of the Adaptationist/KS school,
affecting <em>which</em> of the units RQs are considered central to
the practice of evolutionary genetics, which has thus far been
referred to as &ldquo;conflation&rdquo; and &ldquo;confusion&rdquo; of
RQs.</p>

<p>
Lande, Arnold, and Wade, all at University of Chicago, found that
evolution by selection could be best understood if analyzed
distinguishing processes of selection from those of heritability. As
Wade reviews in his Evolutionary Change-school book on multilevel
selection theory and empirical applications, the strength of selection
has been shown by breeders to be representable as the covariance
between phenotype and relative fitness,
 )<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-61" id="ref-61">61</a>]</sup>
 (Robertson 1966; Wade 2016; Lande &amp; Arnold 1983; Ohta 1983). And,
with regard to multilevel selection, it was later shown that the
covariance between phenotype and fitness</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
across an entire metapopulation, \(\textrm{CovTotal}(z, w[z])\), can
be partitioned into two components (Price 1972):</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>average individual selection within populations,
\(\textrm{CovIndividual}(z,w[z]) = \Sigma j\textrm{Cov}j(z, w[z])/T\);
and</li>

<li>group selection among populations, \(\textrm{CovGroup}(Z,
W[Z])\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
This simple partitioning gave us a method for empirically comparing
the relative strengths of individual and group selection. (Wade 2016:
88)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Recall that the Price EQ, in its single-level form,</p> 
\[\Delta z = \textrm{Cov}(\omega i , zi ) + E(\omega i\Delta zi )\]

<p>
represents the change in (the mean state of) a character, through the
equation with this right-hand side, (where this first term on the
right-hand side of the equation is usually called the <em>selection
term</em>), which shows the covariance of the character, \(z\), and
the reproductive output of the entity manifesting the trait. The
second term, often called the <em>transmission-bias</em> term,
measures the extent to which the character of the offspring entities,
on average, <em>zbar</em> <em>prime</em>, is different from the
parent.</p>

<p>
One usual way, a simple alternative to the one introduced above, to
write about the multilevel representation of the Price EQ is as
follows, where \(Z\) is a character-trait of the higher-level
collective, \(k\) is an index individual of the collective, and the
(relative) reproductive success of the collective is \(\Omega{:}\)</p>

\[\Delta Z = \textrm{Cov}(\Omega k , Zk ) + E(\Omega k \Delta Zk )\]

<p>
In this upper-level form, the left-hand term of the right-hand side of
the equation is called &ldquo;the between-higher-level (or
<em>between-collective) selection term</em>&rdquo;, while the far
right-hand term is &ldquo;the <em>within-collective selection
term</em>&rdquo;, conventionally (see, e.g., Sober &amp; Wilson 1998).
And whether or not the higher-level trait or fitnesses are aggregate
or more complex relationships of the individual/particle level
features, is a vexed issue (Okasha 2006; Lloyd 1988[1994]; Hamilton
1975; Sober &amp; Wilson 1998; Gould 2002).</p>

<p>
But notice what has happened here, in moving back and forth between
the individual level and the multilevel representations of selection
using the Price Eq. What is all about <em>heredity</em>&mdash;the
&ldquo;<em>transmission-bias</em> term&rdquo;&mdash;right-hand term in
the single-layer Price Eq., turns into a <em>selection</em> right-hand
term in the two-layer or multilevel Price Eq, and thus, all about a
selection process: &ldquo;the <em>within-collective selection
term</em>&rdquo; (Sober &amp; Wilson 1998); (I thank J. R. Griesemer
for bringing this point to my attention; Price was aware of this
weakness of his formalism, which is one reason he did not think his
&ldquo;toy&rdquo; model-type applicable in real biological
 situations).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-62" id="ref-62">62</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Does this mean that we have confused an inheritance
process&mdash;reproduction&mdash;with lower-level selection, in the
process of our formalizing and generalizing the theory!? Or&hellip;?
We might understand the two causal evolutionary processes, of
inheritance of individual-level traits, vs. selection of lower-level
entities, on distinct levels of organization, as
&ldquo;entangled&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
As Griesemer put it, pointedly:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
that&rsquo;s <em>conflation</em> if you call the expectation term an
&ldquo;inheritance&rdquo; term but &ldquo;entanglement&rdquo; if you
treat it as a representation of a hierarchical structure that slices
across perspectives (<em>sensu</em> Wimsatt on &ldquo;interactional
complexity&rdquo;
 2007)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-63" id="ref-63">63</a>]</sup></p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
Thus, this might be an explanation of why so many researchers from the
Adaptationist/KS school do <em>mix together</em> <em>into one
thing</em> the requirements for the interactor functional role and the
requirements for manifestor-of-adaptation, as documented throughout
this entry.</p>

<p>
As such, it might provide yet a further argument (see Earnshaw 2015)
to abandon the Price EQ formalism as a good way to represent
<em>any</em> multilevel selection process, whether KS or GS or
species/lineage selection; it predicts the entanglement of causal
processes that most analysts are trying to keep distinct! In other
words, the tool is inappropriate for the job. Why not use the
available tools (contextual analysis and any other causal analytical
tools, such as graph theory (Otsuka 2016a, 2019a,b), as the
Evolutionary Change biologists do? This remains an open question
<strong>concerning best methods</strong>.</p>

<p>
Today, the most urgent questions about the interrelations of genic and
multilevel selection models and model-types revolve around <strong>two
distinct RQs (Research Questions) that are of concern to both
schools</strong> (Kramer &amp; Meunier 2016). The first concerns the
key relationships between the models themselves: including genic,
kin-, and inclusive fitness selection models and model-types from the
Adaptationist school, and group-, and multilevel selection model-types
from the Evolutionary Change school. Let us put it like this:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(1)</dt>
<dd>Are kin selection (KS) as well as inclusive fitness, and group
selection (GS) model-types, equivalent, formally (i.e.,
mathematically), empirically, conceptually, and/or explanatorily?</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The kin selectionist or Adaptationist school, tends to say that these
two types of models, KS/genic/inclusive fitness and multilevel/GS, are
<em>fully formally (i.e., mathematically) equivalent
alternatives</em>, and the researchers usually conclude from that
ostensible formal equivalence a kind of pragmatic equivalence; for
example, &lsquo;use whichever model-type suits your project
 better&rsquo;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-64" id="ref-64">64</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The basic prediction of KS theory is that social behavior, especially
social behavior that benefits others, should correlate with genetic
relatedness or similarity. This is commonly expressed through
Hamilton&rsquo;s rule, \(rb &gt; c,\) where \(r\) is relatedness,
\(b\) is the benefit that behavior offers the conspecific, and \(c\)
is the cost to the
 actor.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-65" id="ref-65">65</a>]</sup>
 The critics following Hamilton, i.e., claiming that KS is a form of
GS, assert that Hamilton&rsquo;s rule &ldquo;almost never holds&rdquo;
(Nowak et al. 2010: 1059). Their opponents claim the opposite: that it
is incorrect to claim that Hamilton&rsquo;s rule requires restrictive
assumptions, or that it almost never holds. On the contrary, they
claim, it holds a great deal of the time (Gardner, West, &amp; Wild
2011). On one philosophical analysis, there are three distinct
versions of Hamilton&rsquo;s rule, and three distinct versions of kin
selection theory under discussion; thus the various parties are
talking past one another (Birch &amp; Okasha 2015).</p>

<p>
Various equivalences and non-equivalences among the key model-types
are discussed by researchers from both schools (see Adaptationist/KS
works by Foster 2004; Okasha 2006; 2018; and Evolutionary Change books
by Wade 1985, 1996, 2016; Simon 2014). Discussions by philosophers
such as Earnshaw have highlighted some distinctive non-equivalences in
methods (2015), arguing that the methods favored by the
Adaptationist/KS school (such as applying the Price Eqs) obscure
important relationships (see examples of this in Bourrat 2021a,b;
Queller 1992, 2011; discussion in Van Veelen et al. 2009a,b,
2012).</p>

<p>
Among the Adaptationist/KS school, the claims to complete
&ldquo;equivalence&rdquo; of genic, kin selection, inclusive fitness,
and multilevel or GS models, are usually taken to signify complete
mathematical, conceptual, and explanatory equivalence of the modeled
evolutionary systems, a claim contested by Evolutionary Change
theorists.</p>

<p>
As an illustration of this approach, West et al. describe the
Adaptationist/KS school view in vivid detail: arguing that one</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip;source of confusion is <strong>the incorrect idea</strong>
that inclusive fitness theory or kin selection are &hellip; just
<strong>special cases of, new group selection</strong>&hellip;.
Perhaps most importantly, <strong><em>there is no biological model or
empirical example that can be explained with the new group selection
approach, that cannot also be understood in terms of kin selection and
inclusive fitness.</em></strong> (West, Griffin, &amp; Gardner 2007:
425; emphasis
 added)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-66" id="ref-66">66</a>]</sup></p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
The introduction of this name, &ldquo;new group selection&rdquo;, by
the Adaptationist/KS school, to refer to the 1970s&ndash;2000s&rsquo;s
theoretical and empirical developments of Evolutionary Change theory,
distinct from KS, was often accompanied by <em>a complete erasure of
the actual history of multilevel selection theory</em>, as descended
from and continuous with the work of Sewall Wright, most specifically
his work on evolution in structured populations, and especially the
evolution of organismic adaptations within demes in such structured
populations (1931, 1938, 1945, 1960).</p>

<p>
This ahistorical approach is complemented by a replacement, fictional
history that includes having multilevel selection theory developed,
<em>ab initio</em> and <em>ex nihilo</em>, by Hamilton in the early
1960s. Some examples:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Historically, MLS [multi-level selection] and kin selection theory
were developed to address &ldquo;altruism&rdquo;: the question of why
an organism should engage in behaviours that seem to reduce its own
expected reproductive success but which aids that of others (Hamilton
1963, 1964). (Earnshaw 2015: 308)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>
Hamilton helped to found a field that shows how natural selection can
act at any level of biological organization. (Foster 2011: 193; citing
D.S. Wilson 1975 and Okasha 2006 for this claim.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In any case, as well as being contested by some within the
Adaptationist/KS school (e.g., Thies &amp; Watson
 2021),<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-67" id="ref-67">67</a>]</sup>
 those who claim full equivalence tend to ignore the applications of
the relevant GS models from Evolutionary Change genetic results (e.g.,
Wade &amp; Breden 1981), which produce easy maintenance of cooperation
and altruism through GS and avoid the &ldquo;cheater fallacy&rdquo;;
instead they argue that &ldquo;only kin selection allows an easy
solution&rdquo; to evolutionary problems producing cooperation and
altruism (West, Griffin, &amp; Gardner 2008; West, El Mouden, &amp;
Gardner 2011, see conflicting results below). Group selectionist
claims are also e.g., rebutted by Marshall 2011, who gives a
particularly succinct summary of this argument, using Price Eq and
modifications of Hamilton&rsquo;s rule, see also Queller 1992,
highlighting issues with Price
 Eq.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-68" id="ref-68">68</a>]</sup>).</p>
 
<p>
In answer to the equivalence RQs, the Evolutionary Change school tends
to say, first, that the model-types are not conceptually or
explanatorily equivalent, and sometimes not even mathematically
 equivalent,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-69" id="ref-69">69</a>]</sup>
 or empirically equivalent. For example, mathematical geneticist
Feldman et al. note:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[T]he comparison between those fertility models interpretable in terms
of individual fitness effects, and the simple symmetric case that
cannot be so interpreted, underscores that the simplest interactions
between individuals in the process of selection can produce
evolutionary conclusions not expected from standard individual fitness
[genic] models. (Feldman, Christiansen, &amp; Liberman 1983: 1009)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Moreover, the Evolutionary Change biologists sometimes add, the
Adaptationist/KS practitioners may not truly understand the models and
structure of the model-types, and therefore think that they are
equivalent in a number of ways, when they are not (Lloyd &amp; Feldman
2002; Lloyd, Lewontin, &amp; Feldman 2008; Wade 2016; Goodnight
 2015).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-70" id="ref-70">70</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
When these equivalence RQs about genic and multilevel selection models
and model-types are discussed in the philosophical literature, much
has depended on citing the work of Dugatkin and Reeve in establishing
this formal equivalence (Dugatkin &amp; Reeve 1994; Sterelny 1996a,
Sterelny 1996b: 577; Sober &amp; Wilson 1998: 57, 98&ndash;99;
Sterelny &amp; Griffiths 1999: 168&ndash;169, 172; B. Kerr and
Godfrey-Smith 2002: 479, 508; Waters 2005: 312; Okasha 2006). However,
Dugatkin and Reeve&rsquo;s very plain prediction of allele frequencies
is an extremely simplistic method for assessing formal model or
model-type equivalence, which pays little mind to the details of the
model and model-types themselves or their dynamics.</p>

<p>
Because allelic parameters and the changes in allelic frequencies
depend on genotypic fitnesses, the genic model-types claimed to be
<em>equivalent</em> to the hierarchical or multilevel model-types are
neither parametrically nor dynamically sufficient (Dugatkin &amp;
Reeve 1994; compare Bijma &amp; Wade 2008; Simon 2014; Lewontin 1974).
Thus, the claimed equivalence seems to be based on conceptual and
theoretical errors or mis-identifications.</p>

<p>
This citation practice continues in philosophy today, as part of a
claim to a metaphysical or epistemic (or methodological)
conventionalism, without addressing the empirical and dynamical issues
challenging the claimed failures of equivalences in both biology and
philosophy (see
 <a href="#GeniPlur">&sect;4.4</a>).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-71" id="ref-71">71</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
As an example of theoretical misunderstanding of the genetics and
evolutionary models, those supporting the Adaptationist/KS school in
the 1970s were taken to task by a founder of evolutionary genetics for
mistakenly jumping to the conclusion that because group engineering
adaptations might be rare, that &ldquo;natural selection is
practically wholly genic&rdquo; (S. Wright 1980: 841; &Aring;gren
 2021b).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-72" id="ref-72">72</a>]</sup>
 This is a fair criticism of the Adaptationist/KS school logic and
record; for decades, critics of GS never considered groups as
interactors, only as interactors-cum-manifestors, and this mistaken
practice continues today in many animal behavior research groups.</p>

<p>
Some leading Adaptationist/KS school genic selectionists did later
acknowledge the significance of the
interactor/manifestor-of-adaptation distinction RQs at the group level
(G. C. Williams 1990: 504, above; 1992; Maynard Smith 1987: 123; 2001:
1497), but their distinctions are not widely shared among
Adaptationist/KS school advocates. Despite the views of these leading
theorists, the Adaptationist school maintains a bias towards using KS
to model <em>all</em> selection processes involving collectives,
therefore leaving GS effectively replaced by
 KS.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-73" id="ref-73">73</a>]</sup>
 But see Hamilton (1975), the originator of KS theory, who argues the
opposite (in contradiction to West, Griffin, &amp; Gardner 2007, 2008,
quoted above; also West, El Mouden, &amp; Gardner 2011).</p>

<p>
And when we consider the Wrightian, Evolutionary Change approach of
multilevel selection model-types&rsquo; empirical accomplishments, it
may be difficult, at first, to understand the resistance of the
Adaptationist/KS
 school.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-74" id="ref-74">74</a>]</sup>
 Overall, the Evolutionary Change school has demonstrated that
populations respond rapidly to experimentally imposed group selection,
and that very commonly occurring indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are
primarily responsible for the strength and effectiveness of group
selection experiments, perhaps surprising, considering the many claims
of the &ldquo;full mathematical equivalence&rdquo; between multilevel
selection models and kin/genic selection models of these same systems
that do not show such
 phenomena.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-75" id="ref-75">75</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Also significant are the field studies using contextual analysis that
have shown that effective and powerful multilevel selection is far
more common in nature than previously expected (Goodnight 2013; e.g.,
Stevens, Goodnight, &amp; Kalisz 1995; Tsuji 1995; Aspi et al. 2003;
Eldakar et al. 2010; Wade 2016). Many of these traits are involved in
cooperative behaviors, functions integrated at the organismic level,
and sometimes group benefits due to group selection (i.e., with
group-level manifestors; Davidson et al. 2016; Su&aacute;rez &amp;
Trivi&ntilde;o 2020; Seeley 1997); see, for example, Muir&rsquo;s
cooperative chicken evolution by group selection, discussed below (J.
Craig &amp; Muir 1996; Muir 2005; Wade, Bijma, et al. 2010; see
Shaffer et al. 2016; Fewell &amp; Page 2000). But these results have
much bearing on the next RQ.</p>

<p>
<strong>The other leading Research Question involving GS today,
primarily significant for the Adaptationist/KS school,
is:</strong></p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(2)</dt>
<dd>Does or can Group Selection lead to Group
 Adaptation?<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-76" id="ref-76">76</a>]</sup></dd>
 </dl>

<p>
Let us reconsider the two interwoven RQs of a typical Adaptationist/KS
school multilevel research problem
 (<a href="#TwoTradReseMultUndeUnitSele">section 3</a>):</p>
 
<ul>

<li>First: Identify an equilibrium/optimal higher-level trait which is
an engineering adaptation, i.e., a manifestor-of-adaptation, and which
is unlikely to evolve by selection of the lower-level entity traits,
that is assumed to oppose it.</li>

<li>Second: Characterize a KS or inclusive fitness model/process, in
which this engineering upper-level-optimal adaptation could have
evolved against the pressures of the lower-level entities&rsquo;
selective processes.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We can see immediately now why kin selectionists/Adaptationist school
practitioners find a common Evolutionary Change approach to
higher-level selection unsatisfactory. Because Adaptationist school
theorists are primarily interested in detecting and explaining
higher-level <em>manifestors</em> of engineering adaptation, then
simply modeling the changes of higher-level <em>interactors</em>, as
the Evolutionary Change school predominantly aims to do, will be
inadequate; it won&rsquo;t answer either of the RQs stated immediately
 above.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-77" id="ref-77">77</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Many using an Adaptationist/KS school approach persist in conflating
GS itself with the combination of the two functional roles (e.g.,
Ramsey &amp; Brandon 2011). A vivid example of such confusion is the
requirement, imposed nearly universally in the Adaptationist School,
that selection favoring the higher-level trait of an interactor must
always work <em>opposing</em> selection favoring the component or
lower-level traits of the interactors making up those groups (Maynard
Smith 1976; West, El Mouden, &amp; Gardner 2011; contrast Wade 1978;
 2016).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-78" id="ref-78">78</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
However, because GS model-types allow us to model a very wide variety
of processes and systems compared to an Adaptationist/KS approach,
including many relevant to the evolution of social behavior,
Evolutionary Change theorists have often argued that their theoretical
and empirical findings are important for the Adaptationist school to
comprehend and use (Goodnight 2015; Goodnight &amp; Stevens 1997). For
example, an Evolutionary Change biologist concludes, forcefully, that
if we follow Maynard Smith&rsquo;s distinction between KS and GS:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip; then this [experimental, empirical] study illustrates that
group selection is more favorable for the evolution of social
behaviors than is kin selection. To the extent that morphology,
physiology, and development affect the manifestation of social
behaviors, then these traits will also be influenced in their
evolution by population structure. (Wade 1980b: 854; emphasis
 added)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-79" id="ref-79">79</a>]</sup></p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
This is an instance of the fact that KS usually relies upon different
model-assumptions about population structure than intergroup selection
(Hamilton 1975; Grafen 1984, 2014; Wade 1980a, 1985); hence, it may be
possible to determine which explanation or model is more likely
accurately describing the population structure (Wade 2016; Ketcham
2018; for general criticism of pluralism in GS, see Shavit 2005; see
also Gordon 2023; Davidson et al. 2016 for an enactment of some of
these GS dynamics in
 ants).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-80" id="ref-80">80</a>]</sup>
 In other words, the empirical evaluation of population structure,
specifically, in models, can be a crucial part of model evaluation and
 confirmation.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-81" id="ref-81">81</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Another Evolutionary Change school example demonstrates the power of
GS and its population structures on both organismic and group traits
in recent commercial breeding of the domestic chicken. Chicken
breeders had long selected for even tiny improvements (approx. 1%) in
egg-laying rates of domesticated hens, which had not recently
improved, due to conflict among hens, with high mortality rates; this
led to the practice of burning their beaks off. However, when these
breeders took a GS approach, selecting hen <em>groups</em> that got
along comparatively better, this produced not only &ldquo;kinder,
gentler&rdquo; hens, but also an improved egg-laying productivity up
to 60% in only 6 generations (Muir 1996; Cheng &amp; Muir 2005; Wade,
Bijma, et al. 2010). This demonstrated both the group and organismic
selective and adaptive power of GS regimes. Colony-level bee and ant
adaptations are other good examples of group- or higher-level
adaptations arising from higher-level selection processes (see
discussion in Seeley 1997; Davidson et al. 2016; Gordon 2014). Lamm
and Kolodny (2022) recently proposed a concept of &ldquo;distributed
adaptation&rdquo;, which we may interpret as group-level engineering
adaptations obtained through processes of individual and higher-level
 selection.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-82" id="ref-82">82</a>]</sup>
 Shifting the focus to groups gives access to new sources of genetic,
heritable variation available for breeders to
 manipulate.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-83" id="ref-83">83</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Finally, for another crucial but underappreciated contribution from
the Evolutionary Change theorists to the Adaptationist/KS school
problems, consider the so-called <em>free rider problems</em> with kin
and GS, such as those seen or set up by evolutionists puzzling over
the evolution of altruism and the purported problems with cheaters to
cooperation. Evolutionary Change theorists have repeatedly
demonstrated that these <strong><em>free rider problems</em></strong>
are pseudo-problems based on misconceptions (Breden &amp; Wade 1991;
Wade 2016; see also Bowles &amp; Gintis 2011; Planer 2015; Sterelny
2012; see Lloyd &amp; Wade 2019 on mutualism selected as a runaway
process, rather than selfishness).</p>

<p>
Take a population mostly made up of altruists that have evolved by GS,
e.g., as described by Hamilton 1975. Those from the Adaptationist/KS
school claim that such populations are constantly under threat of
destruction by cheaters&mdash;individuals that enjoy the fitness
benefits of altruistic behavior by others, but do not pay the costs by
performing it themselves, in Hamilton&rsquo;s terms.</p>

<p>
According to Wade and Breden (1981), a &ldquo;selfish&rdquo; mutation
is no threat to the population of
 altruists.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-84" id="ref-84">84</a>]</sup>
 Take a population divided into groups with A, an altruistic gene with
fitness costs and benefits following Hamilton&rsquo;s rule. Mutation
introduces a mutant copy, a, into the population, and a heterozygous
individual carrying this mutation does not behave as altruistically as
others, but reaps the fitness benefits from them, and is thus at a
selective advantage relative to altruists within its own group. Does
this selfish gene spread through the metapopulation, destroying the
social system, as claimed by the Adaptationist school? Wade
answers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
No it does not. Felix [Breden] and I showed that it spreads if, and
only if, \((1/2k)b \textrm{Total} &lt; c\) (Wade &amp; Breden 1981;
Breden &amp; Wade 1981). This is the opposite of Hamilton&rsquo;s
Rule, the condition necessary for the existence of the altruistic
system in the first place&hellip;. Hamilton&rsquo;s Rule gives the
conditions for a single altruist to invade and replace a population of
&ldquo;original&rdquo; cheaters. As long as it holds, mutant cheaters
share the fate of the original cheaters&mdash;they are replaced by
 altruists.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-85" id="ref-85">85</a>]</sup>
 (Wade 2016: 146&ndash;147)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There is thus an evolutionary equilibrium level of cheaters at a
<em>kin selection-mutation balance</em>, analogous to the usual
<em>mutation-selection balance</em>, which depends on the strength of
group selection. Wade concludes very straightforwardly:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The perception that cheaters are a relentless threat to complex social
systems is a <em>fallacy</em>&hellip;<em>If Hamilton&rsquo;s Rule were
correctly grasped</em> as the condition necessary for group selection
to outweigh opposing individual selection (as Hamilton himself [1975]
recognized), the <em>cheater fallacy</em> would have been laid to rest
a long time ago. (2016: 147; emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As we shall see in
 <a href="#HoloDemi">Section 4.6</a>,
 these very biases in the evolutionary dynamics of
interaction&mdash;in that case, between multi-species consortia, in
place of multi-organismic populations&mdash;are an important feature
of the former&rsquo;s dynamics, and could contribute to explaining the
<em>absence of cheaters</em> from natural mutualisms&mdash;established
recently, see below&mdash;although cheaters are predicted as
inevitable by gene-centered conflict theory to <em>cause the strong
evolutionary instability</em> of such mutualisms (see, e.g., Foster et
al. 2017).</p>

<p>
As we have just seen in this section, according to the Evolutionary
Change school, the predicted problems with GS and KS model-types from
cheaters were based on a fallacy: It turns out that these expected
cheaters also <em>could not be found in nature</em>, when those
researchers <em>most committed to their existence</em> went to find
them, using their best tools. Testing their own
&ldquo;best-studied&rdquo; and routinely-taught exemplars of cheaters
among mutualisms in nature for fulfillment of their own best
theoretical requirements for cheaters, Jones and more than a dozen
other Adaptationist/KS biologists conclude, in their own words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>We find &hellip; there is currently very little support from
fitness data that any of these meet our criteria to be considered
cheaters</em>. (2015: 1270, emphasis added; see
 <a href="#HoloDemi">&sect;4.6</a>
 for further discussion)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On the other hand, the Evolutionary Change school&rsquo;s epigenetics
community genetics model-type easily explains the experimental results
this group found in this failed search for cheaters-in-nature
 experiment.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-86" id="ref-86">86</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Additionally, it may help explain the more frequent origin of
mutualisms from parasitic than from free-living systems, an
evolutionary trajectory opposite to that predicted by the
Adaptationist/KS school&rsquo;s genome conflict theory.</p>

<h3 id="SpecSele">4.2 Species Selection</h3>

<p>
Ambiguities about the definition of a unit of selection have also
snarled the debate about selection processes at the species level. By
the 1970s several leading paleontologists had claimed that species
must have higher-level &ldquo;emergent properties&rdquo;&mdash;by
which they meant species-level engineering adaptations&mdash;in order
to serve as genuine higher-level &ldquo;units of selection&rdquo; in a
multilevel evolutionary process. Species selection thus succumbed for
a time to the same confusions as GS had, conflating these two RQs: Do
species function as interactors, playing an active and significant
role in evolution by selection? And does the evolution of
species-level interactors produce (and assume) species-level
engineering adaptations (and, if so, how often)?</p>

<p>
See especially, for example, Vrba&rsquo;s demand for &ldquo;emergent
properties&rdquo; at the species level, explicitly inspired by Maynard
Smith&rsquo;s demanding analysis of GS (Vrba 1984: 319; Maynard Smith
1976). This amounts to assuming that there must be a group-level
engineering adaptation in order to say that group selection can occur,
an early-Williams-style objection that <em>both</em> Maynard Smith and
Williams later abandoned, as illustrated in
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;4.1</a>
 (G. C. Williams 1990, 1992; Maynard Smith 1987; 2001), but this dual
requirement for both interactor and manifestor at a higher level was
carried over into early-mid species selection discussions, although
not in those terms.</p>

<p>
For the early history of the species selection debate, then, asking
whether species could be <em>units of selection</em> meant asking a
combination of whether they fulfill <em>both</em> the interactor and
manifestor-of-adaptation roles, based directly on that argument from
GS (Vrba 1983: 388; 1984; Vrba &amp; Gould 1986; Vrba &amp; Eldredge
1984; Eldredge 1985; see also Sober 1984: 367&ndash;368; Cracraft
1985: 225).</p>

<p>
For example, certain cases are rejected as higher-level <em>selection
processes</em> because</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
frequencies of the properties of lower-level individuals which are
part of a high-level individual simply do not make convincing
higher-level adaptations. (Eldredge 1985: 133)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Such an &ldquo;emergent&rdquo; character may be the result of a
selection process at the species level, but it should not be treated
as a pre-condition of such a process. As Heisler and Damuth put
it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The issue is not whether some characters are emergent or not; the
issue is the relationship between the characters and fitness (Heisler
&amp; Damuth 1987). (Damuth &amp; Heisler 1988: 418)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Neither group effects on organismic fitness, nor emergent group
characters, are necessary for selection to occur at the level of
groups in nature, which may involve <em>any</em> characters of the
higher-level
 group.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-87" id="ref-87">87</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Consider the lineage-wide trait of variability. Treating species and
lineages as interactors has a long tradition (Dobzhansky 1956; Thoday
1953; Lewontin 1958; Lloyd 1988[1994]; from here on within this
discussion, I will just refer to &ldquo;species&rdquo; to signify
<em>both</em> species and lineages). If species are conceived as
interactors (and not necessarily manifestors), then the notion of
species selection is not vulnerable to the original anti
group-selection objections from the early genic-selectionists (Maynard
Smith 1976, 2001; G. C. Williams 1966; 1992), as they later
 agreed.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-88" id="ref-88">88</a>]</sup>
 Thoday&rsquo;s old idea was that lineages with certain properties of
being able to respond to environmental stresses would be selected for,
and thus that the trait of variability itself would be selected for
and would spread in the population of populations or species. In other
words, lineages were treated as interactors. The earlier researchers
spoke loosely of &ldquo;adaptations&rdquo; where they seemingly meant
product-of-selection adaptations.</p>

<p>
These early researchers were explicitly <em>not</em> concerned with
the effect of species selection on organismic level traits but with
the fitness effect on species- and lineage-level characters such as
speciation rates, lineage-level survival, and extinction rates of
species. Some argued that this sort of case represents a perfectly
good form of species selection, using so-called &ldquo;emergent
fitnesses&rdquo; (Lloyd
 1988[1994]),<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-89" id="ref-89">89</a>]</sup>
 even though some balk at the thought that lineage-level variability
would then be considered, under a product-of-selection definition, a
species-level adaptation; see discussion in Gould 2002; Ketcham 2018;
Grantham 1995). Hautmann noted:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
An important argument in favour of the &ldquo;emergent fitness
concept&rdquo; is that species selection acting on <em>aggregate</em>
organismic traits can theoretically oppose selection at the organismic
level and is therefore not reducible to this level (Grantham 1995).
(2020: 3 of 11)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Paleontologists used this approach to species selection, e.g., in
their research on fossil gastropods, looking at relationships between
lineage ranges and trait variabilities (Jablonski 1987, 2008;
Jablonski &amp; Hunt 2006; Erwin 2000; Sepkoski 2020; see recent study
of dynamics of these in Freedberg, Urban, &amp; Cunniff 2021); the
approach has also been used in the leading text on speciation (Coyne
&amp; Orr
 2004).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-90" id="ref-90">90</a>]</sup>
 The variabilities associated with increased or variable sized ranges
have been explored along these lines, as
 well.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-91" id="ref-91">91</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
While species geographic range is well-established as an interactor
trait (e.g., Nanninga &amp; Manica 2018), it has been noted that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A variety of other traits [beyond geographic range size] have been
examined (reviewed in Coyne &amp; Orr 2004; Jablonski 2008; Dynesius
&amp; Jansson 2014), many of which might covary with demographic
controls. These results are consistent with links between demography
and speciation rates. (Harvey, Singhal, &amp; Rabosky 2019: 83)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Ultimately, the current widely-accepted definition of species
selection among the scientists is consistent with an interactor
interpretation of a unit of selection (in addition to those just
discussed: Vrba 1989; Lieberman &amp; Vrba 2005; Jablonski 2008;
2017a,b; Erwin 2000; Polly et al. 2017; Anderegg et al. 2019; Benito
Garz&oacute;n, Robson, &amp; Hampe 2019).</p>

<h3 id="GeniSele">4.3 Genic Selectionism</h3>

<p>
One may understandably think that the early genic selectionists were
interested in the replicator version of the reproducer
question&mdash;that is, what entity is the replicator?&mdash;because
of their claims that the unit of selection ought to be the replicator.
This would be a mistake. Rather, the primary interest is in a specific
ontological question about benefit (Dawkins 1976, 1982a,b),
 (<a href="#BeneReseQues">&sect;2.4</a>),
 and the answer to <em>that</em> question dictates the answers to the
other three &ldquo;units&rdquo; questions delineated in
 <a href="#FourBasiReseQues">Section 2</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Briefly, because replicators are the only entities that
&ldquo;survive&rdquo; the evolutionary process, they must be the
long-term beneficiaries (Dawkins 1982a,b). What happens in the process
of evolution by natural selection happens <em>for their sake</em>, for
their benefit. Hence, interactors interact for the replicators&rsquo;
benefit, and adaptations belong, ultimately, to the replicators.
Replicators are the only entities with real <em>agency</em> as
initiators of causal chains that lead to the phenotypes; hence, they
accrue the credit and are the <em>real</em> units of selection.</p>

<p>
This version of the answer to &ldquo;the&rdquo; units of selection
question amounts to a combination of the beneficiary question plus the
manifestor-of-adaptation question&mdash;plus the interactor question,
because a manifestor must also be an interactor in an
evolution-by-selection process. Dawkins&rsquo; argument is that people
who focus on interactors in isolation&mdash;as so many do, who are
studying the dynamics of evolutionary change&mdash;or on
organismic-level adaptations, as many from the Adaptationist/KS and
Evolutionary Change schools both do, are laboring under a
misunderstanding of evolutionary theory (Dawkins 1976, 1982a,b).</p>

<p>
In what follows, two aspects of Dawkins&rsquo; specific version of the
units of selection problem shall be characterized. I clarify the key
issues of interest to Dawkins and relate these to the issues of
interest to others.</p>

<p>
There are two mistakes that Dawkins is <em>not</em> making. First, he
states explicitly that genes or other replicators/reproducers do not
&ldquo;literally face the cutting edge of natural selection. It is
their phenotypic effects that are the proximal subjects of
selection&rdquo; (1982a: 47). Thus, he emphasizes that interactors
(understood under Hull&rsquo;s, Brandon&rsquo;s, and Lloyd&rsquo;s
definition) are necessary for the evolutionary process; it is not
necessary to believe that replicators are directly
&ldquo;visible&rdquo; to selection forces (1982b: 176; <em>contra</em>
Gould 1977; Istvan 2013). Moreover, he argues the debate about group
versus organismic selection is &ldquo;a factual dispute about the
level at which selection is most effective in nature&rdquo;, whereas
his own point is &ldquo;about what we ought to mean when we talk about
a unit of selection&rdquo; (1982a:
 46).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-92" id="ref-92">92</a>]</sup>
 We shall return to this issue in
 <a href="#GeniPlur">section 4.4, Genic Pluralists</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Second, Dawkins does not specify how large a chunk of the genome he
will allow as a replicator; there is no commitment to the notion that
single exons are the only possible replicators/reproducers (see
 <a href="#ReplReseQues">&sect;2.2 Replicators/Reproducer Question</a>).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-93" id="ref-93">93</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
On what basis, then, does Dawkins reject the importance of the
research questions about interactors
 (<a href="#InteReseQues">&sect;2.1</a>,
 <a href="#TwoTradReseMultUndeUnitSele">&sect;3</a>,
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;&sect;4.1&ndash;4.6</a>)
 and/or manifestors
 (<a href="#ManiAdapReseQues">&sect;2.3</a>,
 <a href="#TwoTradReseMultUndeUnitSele">&sect;3</a>,
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;&sect;4.1&ndash;4.6</a>)?
 The answer lies in the particular question in which he is solely
interested, namely, What is &ldquo;the nature of the entity <em>for
whose benefit adaptations</em> may be said to
 exist?&rdquo;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-94" id="ref-94">94</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
When Dawkins refers to &ldquo;adaptations&rdquo;, he is always
referring to engineering adaptations. Moreover, he rejects the notion
that the individual organism or group that exhibits the adaptive
phenotypic trait can be the &ldquo;beneficiary&rdquo; he seeks, (see
G. C. Williams 1966;
 <a href="#ManiAdapReseQues">&sect;2.3</a>,
 <a href="#BeneReseQues">&sect;2.4</a>,
 <a href="#TwoTradReseMultUndeUnitSele">&sect;3</a>,
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;&sect;4.1&ndash;4.6</a>),<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-95" id="ref-95">95</a>]</sup> because a true unit of
selection must also be &ldquo;the unit that actually survives or fails
to survive&rdquo; the evolution-by-selection process (Dawkins 1982a:
60). Because organisms, groups, and even genomes do not actually
survive the evolution-by-selection process, the answer to the survival
question must be the replicator/reproducer, Dawkins
 reasons.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-96" id="ref-96">96</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Strictly speaking, this is false, under Dawkins&rsquo; definition of a
replicator; it is <em>copies</em> of the replicators that
survive&mdash;or rather, Griesemer&rsquo;s biologically-continuous
reproducers,
 <a href="#ReplReseQues">section 2.2</a>;
 compare Griesemer (1998, 2000a,b,c, 2003, 2005, 2016) on reproduction
and the evolution-by-selection process, which imposes the significant
distinction between &ldquo;replicator&rdquo; and
&ldquo;reproducer&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
The important point for Dawkins is the claim that replicators&mdash;in
some formal sense, and reproducers, in the biological sense&mdash;are
the only long-term survivors of the evolution-by-selection
process&mdash;and more specifically, the
evolution-of-engineering-adaptation process; this automatically
answers also the question of who manifests the
 adaptations.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-97" id="ref-97">97</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
But there is still a problem with putting the reproducer/replicator at
the heart of the process. Although this conclusion is:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
there should be no controversy over replicators versus vehicles.
Replicator survival and vehicle selection are two aspects of the same
process, (Dawkins 1982a: 60)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
the genic selectionist does not just leave the vehicle selection
debate alone. Instead, the argument is advanced that <em>we do not
need the concept of discrete vehicles at all</em>. We shall
investigate this idea also in
 <a href="#GeniPlur">section 4.4 Genic Pluralisms</a>.</p>
 
<p>
It is crucial to notice that Dawkins&rsquo; argument against
&ldquo;the vehicle concept&rdquo;, concerns exclusively an argument
against the desirability of seeing the <em>individual organism</em> as
<em>the</em> vehicle. The narrowness of this point is lost on the
genic pluralists, to their detriment.</p>

<p>
Dawkins&rsquo; target is explicitly those who hold what he calls the
&ldquo;Central Theorem&rdquo;, i.e., that <em>individual organisms
should be seen as maximizing their own inclusive fitness</em> (1982b:
5, 55). But it is inappropriate <strong>always,</strong> Dawkins
argues, to ask how an organism&rsquo;s behavior benefits that
organism&rsquo;s inclusive
 fitness.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-98" id="ref-98">98</a>]</sup>
 Dawkins warns, &ldquo;<em>theoretical dangers attend the assumption
that adaptations are for the good of&hellip;the individual
organism</em>&rdquo; (1982b: 91). The precise view being criticized by
early genic selectionists thus <em>assumes</em> that the individual
organism is the interactor, <em>and</em> the beneficiary, <em>and</em>
the manifestor of adaptation (Lloyd 1988 [1994]).</p>

<p>
These arguments are indeed damaging to the Central Theorem, but they
are ineffective against all other approaches that define the
functional interactor role more generally, that is, with entities as
interactors up and down the biological hierarchy, whether or not these
are <em>also</em> seen as engineering adaptations (see
 <a href="#TwoTradReseMultUndeUnitSele">&sect;3</a>,
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;&sect;4.1&ndash;4.6</a>). These issues highlight why it is important not to
conflate RQs about units of selection with questions about biological
 individuality<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-99" id="ref-99">99</a>]</sup>
 (see the entry on
 <a href="../biology-individual/">biological individuals</a>).</p>
 
<p>
In
 sum,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-100" id="ref-100">100</a>]</sup>
 Dawkins has identified or assumed four distinct meanings of a unit of
selection as necessary for something to be a unit of
selection&mdash;replicator (corrected to reproducer), long-term,
ultimate beneficiary, ultimate manifestor of adaptation, and the
making (i.e., agency) of its own interactor or vehicle&rsquo;s traits
(including engineering adaptations). The issue of lower-level agency
and manifestor of adaptation in this context has been revived recently
in philosophical discussion (Okasha 2018).</p>

<p>
In
 <a href="#GeniPlur">Section 4.4</a>,
 we will consider some relatively more recent work in which genic
selectionism is defended through a pluralist approach to modeling.
What matters in their final analysis, though, is exactly the same, and
that is <em>the search for the ultimate beneficiary of the evolution
by selection process</em>. [[please add Links listed in NOTES 99 and
100 for this page]]</p>

<h3 id="GeniPlur">4.4 Genic Pluralism</h3>

<p>
The original genic selectionists had objections
 (<a href="#GeniSele">&sect;4.3</a>),
 to the interactor role in evolution. They admitted that such
&ldquo;vehicles&rdquo; were necessary for the evolution-by-selection
processes, but accorded them no weight as &ldquo;units of
selection&rdquo;, because they were not the &ldquo;ultimate
beneficiary&rdquo;. Soon, there appeared to be a new angle
 available.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-101" id="ref-101">101</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
&ldquo;Genic pluralism&rdquo; attempts to bypass the challenges of the
relationships among reproducer and interactor RQs by effectively
turning genes into interactors (Waters 1986; Sterelny &amp; Kitcher
1988). There are thus two &ldquo;images&rdquo; of natural selection,
presented as similar to a &ldquo;Necker cube&rdquo;: (1) the usual
multilevel one in which selection models are given in terms of
reproducer success via a hierarchy of interactors and possibly
manifestors, interfacing with their traits&rsquo; environments, up and
down the biological hierarchy
 (<a href="#TwoTradReseMultUndeUnitSele">&sect;3</a>,
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;4.1</a>). And (2)&mdash;here you imagine the flipped image of a
Necker cube&mdash;is given in terms of <em>replicators</em> [genes or
equivalent reproducers] having properties that affect their abilities
to leave copies of themselves, while seeing only these &ldquo;ultimate
beneficiaries&rdquo; <em>in the interactor roles,</em> with genic
causal/interactive traits in various layered
 &ldquo;environments&rdquo;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-102" id="ref-102">102</a>]</sup>
 When not done in a special, derivative, way, these latter are usually
called <em>interactors</em>, but are now called &ldquo;genic
environments&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
For example, take the claim that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
All selective episodes (or, perhaps, almost all) can be interpreted in
terms of genic selection. That is an important fact about natural
selection. (Kitcher, Sterelny, &amp; Waters 1990: 160)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
What exactly is meant by this? We are reminded strongly of many in the
Adaptationist school&rsquo;s claims about the mathematical,
explanatory, and pragmatic equivalence of group selection models with
kin selection/genic/inclusive fitness models, such as West, El Mouden,
&amp; Gardner&rsquo;s 2011 false claims discussed in
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;4.1</a>
 (Wade 1996; 2016). And indeed, in the philosophical context, much
attention is paid to showing that the two model-types in
question&mdash;genic and Evolutionary Change school&rsquo;s multilevel
ones&mdash;can represent certain patterns of selection equally well,
once underpinned with all the relevant theoretical, statistical, and
empirical information. This is argued for using both specific examples
and schema for translating multilevel models into genic ones. We
briefly review how this is done, and then ask: But what exactly is
accomplished by demonstrating such a translation, theoretically,
metaphysically, biologically, or philosophically?</p>

<p>
In a classic account of the efficacy of multilevel selection, starting
with interdemic selection&mdash;the t-allele case that even G. C.
Williams acknowledged was group selection&mdash;Lewontin &amp; Dunn
1960 and Lewontin 1962 found first, in this t-allele mouse example,
that there was allelic selection; Second, they also found genotypic
selection; Third, they also found a substantial effect of interdemic
selection in the form of group extinction because female mice would
often find themselves in groups in which all males were sterile, and
the group itself would therefore go extinct. Establishing these facts
and relations, then, is how a genuine and empirically robust
multilevel, interdemic, plus organismic, plus genic selection model
was discovered, empirically explored, and developed (Lewontin &amp;
Dunn 1960 and Lewontin 1962).</p>

<p>
The key to understanding the genic reinterpretation of this multilevel
selection model type is to grasp that the pluralists use a concept of
genic environment that their critics ignore. The pluralists explain
how to &ldquo;construct&rdquo;&mdash;actually, reconstruct&mdash;a
genic model representing the evolutionary causes responsible for the
frequency of the t-allele. This is done by treating the information
about interactors in the multilevel model (gained using the
interactor-identifying tools), as &ldquo;genic environments&rdquo; in
the new genic-level
 models.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-103" id="ref-103">103</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Something philosophically significant is meant to follow from the
claims that multilevel Evolutionary Change or KS models&rsquo;
interactors can be reformulated or renamed in terms of the
genic/replicator level entities and their reconstituted hierarchical
properties. These ostensible equivalences between multilevel and
<em>genic</em> model-types are actually very controversial, as
reviewed in
 <a href="#GrouSele">Section 4.1</a>,
 and have been resisted on a variety of
 grounds.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-104" id="ref-104">104</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
But, assuming that the genic reformulated interpretations of the
multilevel models&rsquo; structures have been accepted, the big
payoff&mdash;both philosophical and biological&mdash;of the genic
<em>causal</em> point of view&mdash;and note that the <em>causal
level</em> is simply <em>assumed</em> in virtue of the allelic state
space&mdash;is claimed to be:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Once the possibility of many, equally adequate, representations of
evolutionary processes has been recognized, philosophers and
biologists can turn their attention to more serious projects than that
of <em>quibbling about the real unit of selection</em>. (Kitcher,
Sterelny, &amp; Waters 1990: 161; emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
By &ldquo;quibbling about the real unit of selection&rdquo;, here, the
authors seem to be referring to the large literature in which
evolutionists and philosophers have given concrete, empirical evidence
and/or proposed standards for something to serve in the significantly
distinct theoretical functional roles of an evolutionary
<em>interactor</em> (and often also a <em>manifestor</em> of
engineering adaptation), or a <em>reproducer/replicator</em> or a
<em>beneficiary</em>&mdash;all instances of debates about &ldquo;units
of selection&rdquo;&mdash;in an evolutionary causal selection process
 (<a href="#FourBasiReseQues">&sect;2</a>,
 <a href="#TwoTradReseMultUndeUnitSele">&sect;3</a>,
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;&sect;4.1&ndash;4.6</a>).
 This would, on the face of it, appear to be ordinary scientific
practice for evolutionary biologists, but these philosophers would
like to put a stop to it.</p>

<p>
What interests the pluralist genic philosophers is a <strong>proposed
equivalence</strong> between being able to tell the selection story
one way: in terms of the functional, theoretical, roles of
interactors, manifestors, and reproducers; and telling the
&ldquo;same&rdquo; story another way: purely in terms of theoretical
&ldquo;genic agency&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Significantly, however, neither Dawkins himself, nor Williams, argued
to <em>eliminate</em> the role, existence, or importance of
evolutionary interactors. Rather, both thought interactors
(Dawkins&rsquo; vehicles) to be <em>essential</em> to understanding
evolution-by-natural-selection processes. Thus, genic pluralists have
fundamentally over-reached. The pluralists attack the view that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
for any selection process, there is a uniquely correct identification
of the operative selective forces and the level at which each
impinges. (Waters 1991: 553)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Rather, they claim, &ldquo;We believe that <em>asking about</em> the
<em>real unit of selection</em> is an exercise in muddled
metaphysics&rdquo; (emphasis added; Kitcher, Sterelny, &amp; Waters
1990: 159), because &ldquo;the <em>causes</em> of one and the same
selection process can be <em>correctly described at different
levels</em>&rdquo;, including especially the genic one (Waters 1991:
555; emphasis added).</p>

<p>
Moreover, these causal descriptions in purely genic terms, compared to
multilevel models, are on <em>equal</em> ontological and empirical
footing. Equal, that is, except for when Sterelny and Kitcher make the
dogmatic statement that biologists or philosophers make an error to
claim</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
that selection processes must be described in a <em>particular
way</em>, and their error involves them in positing entities,
&ldquo;targets of selection&rdquo;, that <em>do not exist</em>.
(Sterelny &amp; Kitcher 1988: 359; emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
&ldquo;Targets of selection&rdquo; are also known as
<em>interactors</em>.</p>

<p>
Thus, here, the genic pluralists are apparently denying the <em>very
existence of interactors in evolutionary selective processes</em>
<em>altogether</em>, a position much more radical than Dawkins&rsquo;
or Williams&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
The pluralists thus are arguing against not only the utility, but also
the existence, of any entity filling the functional, causal role of
the evolutionary interactor in the evolution-by-selection process.
They argue for this conclusion on the basis of their claim that all of
these selection processes may be <em>represented</em> using purely
their translated models of genic-level causes. But they apparently
fail to comprehend that the complete, genic-level story cannot be told
without taking the functional role of evolutionary interactors into
account; thus the pluralists cannot avoid &lsquo;quibbling about
interactors&rsquo;, as they desire (Dawkins 1982b; Brandon 1982;
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;4.1</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Recall what the interactor RQ amounts to: What levels of entities
interact as a whole with their environment through their traits (at a
given level of biological organization) in such a way that it makes a
difference to reproducer/replicator success?
 (<a href="#InteReseQues">&sect;2.1</a>,
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;4.1</a>). There has been much discussion about how to delineate,
identify, and locate interactors among multilayered processes of
selection, see above,
 <a href="#InteReseQues">&sect;2.1</a>,
 <a href="#TwoTradReseMultUndeUnitSele">&sect;3</a>,
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;4.1</a>,
 <a href="#SpecSele">&sect;4.2</a>, but each approach generally takes the notion of the
interactor as a <em>necessary component</em> to understanding an
evolution by selection process, because it (Dawkins&rsquo; vehicle) is
the locus of <em>causal interaction</em> between the phenotypic
downstream product of a reproducer/replicator, and its environment
(Dawkins 1976, 1982a,b; G. C. Williams 1966).</p>

<p>
Or, put purely in Dawkins&rsquo; terms, most replicators&rsquo;
phenotypic effects are represented in &ldquo;vehicles&rdquo;
(<em>interactors</em>), which are themselves the &ldquo;proximate
targets of natural selection&rdquo; (Dawkins 1982a: 62). For Dawkins,
and this seems to also go for the genic pluralists, they simply do not
want to consider such objects an <em>answer</em> to <em>the
essential</em> units RQ, but rather prefer the answer isolating the
<em>ultimate beneficiary</em> of the evolution-by-selection process as
the sole &ldquo;real unit of selection&rdquo;
 (<a href="#BeneReseQues">&sect;2.4</a>,
 <a href="#GeniSele">&sect;4.3</a>).</p>

<p>
Such a preference for answering the beneficiary question fails,
however, to demonstrate that interactors (&ldquo;targets of
selection&rdquo;) do not <em>exist</em>, as Dawkins knew, and thus
they need to be explicitly and fully acknowledged in any complete
account. As shown in
 <a href="#GeniSele">&sect;4.3</a>,
 the only &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo;/interactor Dawkins was interested in
arguing <em>against</em> was the animal behaviorist&rsquo;s
<em>individual organism per se, as &ldquo;maximizing its inclusive
fitness&rdquo;,</em> in the &ldquo;Central Theorem&rdquo;; this is
decidedly <em>not</em> a rejection of the general evolutionary
functional role of interactors. Thus, this genic pluralists&rsquo;
misreading of Dawkins is both particularly widespread, and
profound.</p>

<p>
Note that the pluralists use the identical methods for isolating
relevant genic-level environments as others do for the isolating of
interactors for multilevel genetic modeling. What, we may ask, is the
real difference between the resulting models in the end? The genic
pluralists call them &ldquo;causal alternatives&rdquo;, but in what
sense are they truly <em>different</em> alternatives?</p>

<p>
What is different is that the genic pluralists want to tell the causal
story&mdash;discovered by investigating interactors and
reproducers&mdash;in terms of genes alone (reproducer/replicators),
and <em>never</em> in terms of interactors, despite the fact that
these were necessary for the causal analyses. Moreover, they propose
doing away with interactors altogether, by <em>renaming or
reconfiguring</em> them as the genic-perspective-environments. Are we
to believe that <strong>renaming</strong> certain essential model
structures actually changes the metaphysics or meanings of the
evolutionary causal model-type?</p>

<p>
This issue concerning renaming of model structures is especially
confusing in the genic pluralist presentations, because they
repeatedly rely on an assumption or intuition that, by using an
allelic state space, we are <em>dealing with allelic causes</em>. This
assumption is easily traced back to the original genic selectionist
views on units of selection
 (<a href="#GeniSele">&sect;4.3</a>)
 that alleles are the <em>ultimate beneficiaries</em> of any long term
selection process (G. C. Williams 1966; Dawkins 1976, 1982a,b).</p>

<p>
Thus, the genic pluralist argument rests substantially, although
almost invisibly, on a commitment regarding the supreme importance of
the ultimate beneficiary question
 (<a href="#BeneReseQues">&sect;2.4</a>,
 <a href="#ManiAdapReseQues">&sect;2.3</a>,
 <a href="#InteReseQues">&sect;2.1</a>;
 <a href="#TwoTradReseMultUndeUnitSele">&sect;3</a>;
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;4.1</a>,
 <a href="#GeniSele">&sect;4.3</a>). It is unclear what interest it has for either
evolutionary theorizing, model-building, or research, (beyond its
corrective use for the &ldquo;Central Theorem&rdquo;,
 <a href="#GeniSele">&sect;4.3</a>),
 and a further case for any philosophical or theoretical interest is
not clearly made by the genic pluralists. They make a faulty&mdash;too
radical&mdash;argument about the eliminability of interactors, and
offer nothing else that Dawkins has not already given.</p>

<p>
Thus, while the genic pluralists attempt to dismiss the debates about
research involving identifying and <em>finding interactors</em> in
selection as mere &ldquo;quibbles&rdquo;, and also claim such are
<em>without correct</em> and <em>incorrect answers</em>, the genic
pluralists <strong>need to know</strong> not only the research results
into the multilevel interactors, but also the correct answers to
interactor research questions <em>in order to get their desired
correct and accurate &ldquo;allelic causes&rdquo;</em> in their genic
models. Hence, how interactors are discerned/identified really
matters, that is, it makes a metaphysical as well as practical,
scientific, and epistemic <em>difference</em>, <em>to them</em> (Lloyd
 2005).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-105" id="ref-105">105</a>]</sup>).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-106" id="ref-106">106</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
In sum, genic pluralism&rsquo;s impact has been largely philosophical
rather than biological. Within philosophy, critical responses to the
genic pluralist position fall into two main categories: pragmatic and
causal.</p>

<p>
The pragmatic response to genic pluralism primarily notes that in any
given selective scenario the genic perspective provides no information
that is not available from the multilevel point of view. This state of
affairs is taken by critics of this type as sufficient reason to
prefer whichever perspective is most useful for solving the problems
facing a particular
 researcher.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-107" id="ref-107">107</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The other primary philosophical response to genic pluralism is based
on arguments concerning the problematic issues about the causal
structure of selective episodes (and these concerns are actually
shared by many biologists). While genic pluralism may indeed get the
short-term &ldquo;genetic book-keeping&rdquo; correct, it does not,
except through arbitrary renaming, or a kind of sleight-of-hand, and
through blocking visibility of the essential interactor functional
role, accurately reflect the evolutionary causal processes that bring
about the result in question (see discussion in
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;4.1</a>;
 Wimsatt
 1980a,b).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-108" id="ref-108">108</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Let us summarize the consequences of the genic pluralists&rsquo;
celebrated genic equivalences and their actual derivativeness, in
terms of the science and metaphysics of the processes discussed.</p>

<p>
First, the genic pluralists end up offering not, as they claim, a
variety of genuinely diverse causal versions of the selection process
at different levels. This is because the causes of the multilevel
models, determined using ordinary statistical tools and definitions of
evolutionary interactors in their functional roles, are simply renamed
in the lower-level models, but remain fully intact as relevant
evolutionary causes at the full range of higher and lower levels,
regardless. Perhaps more importantly, no new allelic causes are
introduced; they are simply renamed.</p>

<p>
Second, while genic models may be derived from multilevel models, they
fail to sustain the necessary supporting methodology. Third, the lack
of genuine alternative causal accounts damages the particular claims
of pluralism or, at least, of any interesting philosophical variety of
theoretical, empirical, or competitive pluralism separate from this
anatomy of different RQs. It is taken as given that there are a
variety of ways to model many selection processes in population
genetics; the key question here concerns specific information
structured into those model-types and specific models. For example, a
biologist and philosopher investigate various consequences of pursuing
research using, alternatively, organismic and trait group models, and
their paper is a useful modern application and explanation of Ilan
Eschel&rsquo;s 1972 neighbor selection work (B. Kerr &amp;
Godfrey-Smith 2002). But note that the authors help themselves at the
start of the paper to all the higher-level causal relationship
information they
 need.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-109" id="ref-109">109</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Thus, there are no genuine causal alternatives being presented at the
genic level, unless you count renaming model structures as
metaphysically or explanatorily significant (Okasha 2011, 2018;
Sterelny &amp; Kitcher 1988). It should be noted that this result does
<em>not</em>, of course, eliminate the possibility of the genic level
acting as interactors in any given case, such as meiotic drive (Lloyd
1986). See discussion in
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;4.1</a>
 and
 <a href="#GeniSele">&sect;4.3</a>
 on Genic Selectionism.</p>

<h3 id="UnitEvolTranIndi">4.5 Units of Evolutionary Transition in Individuality</h3>

<p>
The units under analysis so far&mdash;be they genes, organisms, or
populations&mdash;were seen as more or less on the same level of
organization, before and after a given evolutionary process.
&ldquo;Evolutionary Transitions in Individuality&rdquo; (<em>ETI</em>;
also <em>MET</em>, &ldquo;Major Transitions in Evolution&rdquo;)
present a unique set of complications to such assumptions within the
units and levels debates. This topic is explored under several entries
in the SEP:
 <a href="../biology-individual/">biological individuals</a>,
 <a href="../macroevolution/">philosophy of macroevolution</a>,
 <a href="../game-evolutionary/">evolutionary game theory</a>.
 We emphasize its relations to the debates about units below.</p>

<h4 id="NewETIReseQues">New ETI Research Questions</h4>

<p>
Evolutionary transition is &ldquo;the process that creates
<em>new</em> levels of biological organization&rdquo; (Griesemer
2000a: 69), such as the origins of chromosomes, multicellularity,
eukaryotes, and social groups (Maynard-Smith &amp; Szathm&aacute;ry
1995: 6&ndash;7). These transitions all share a common feature,
namely, &ldquo;entities that were capable of independent replication
before the transition can replicate only as part of a larger whole
after it&rdquo; (Maynard-Smith &amp; Szathm&aacute;ry 1995: 6). The
claim is that these newly-reproducing, more-inclusive wholes must
involve new evolutionary dynamics collecting and reproducing them over
generations of the more-inclusive entities.</p>

<p>
ETIs can evolve such new potential levels and units of selection, by
creating new kinds of entities having the right sorts of relations
among fitness and properties, or <em>successful
 reproduction</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-110" id="ref-110">110</a>]</sup>
 Such a task requires a diachronic perspective, one under which the
properties of our currently extant units of selection cannot be
presupposed or assumed. As Griesemer writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip;[A]s long as evolutionary theory concerns [only] the function
of <em>contemporary</em> units at <em>fixed</em> levels of the
biological hierarchy&hellip;, the functionalist approach, [using
evolutionary functional causal roles, e.g., of reproducers,
interactors, beneficiaries, and manifestors], may be adequate to its
intended task. However, if a philosophy of units is to address
&hellip; problems of evolutionary <em>transition</em>, then a
different approach is needed. (2003: 174)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Griesemer introduces and emphasizes the evolutionary functional role
of the &ldquo;reproducer&rdquo; concept
 (<a href="#ReplReseQues">&sect;2.2</a>)
 to expand the &ldquo;replicator&rdquo; role, which incorporates the
processes of <em>development</em> into the units of selection; it is a
step toward meeting the goal of addressing ETI, and</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip;the dependency of formerly independent replicators on the
&ldquo;replication&rdquo; of the wholes&mdash;the basis for the
definition of evolutionary transition &hellip; is a <em>developmental
dependency</em> that should be incorporated into the analysis of
units. (Griesemer 2000a: 75)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, the <em>reproducer</em> concept was introduced to encompass such
processes, expanding the notion of replicator (Griesemer 1998, 2000c).
Griesemer emphasizes both development and materiality in his
definition:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The process of reproduction can be analyzed as multiplication of
material overlapping propagules that confer the capacity to develop,
specified in terms of the minimum notion of development as acquisition
of the capacity to reproduce. (2000c: 74)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thinking in broader terms of reproducers avoids the presupposition of
evolved coding mechanisms implicit to the original concept of
replicators. In the case of ETI, this allows us to separate the basic
development involved in the origin of a new biological level, from the
later evolution of sophisticated developmental mechanisms for the
&ldquo;stabilization and maintenance of a new level of
reproduction&rdquo; (Griesemer 2000a: 77; 1998; 2005; 2014; 2016;
Grosberg &amp; Strathmann 1998).</p>

<p>
We can see that, in their picture of the ETI group of RQs, Maynard
Smith and Szathm&aacute;ry ask an overarching question about units of
selection from the Adaptationist/KS school perspective (1995):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Why did not natural selection, acting on entities at the lower level
(replicating molecules, free-living prokaryotes, asexual protists,
single cells, individual organisms), disrupt integration at the
higher-level (chromosomes, eukaryotic cells, sexual species,
multicellular organisms, societies)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In delineating the possible and responsive answers to this RQ
according to their preferred practices, Szathm&aacute;ry and Maynard
Smith state clearly their commitment to using a genic-centered
approach&mdash;specifically, the cheater dynamics of an
Adaptationist/KS genic approach (see
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;4.1</a>
 on &ldquo;cheater fallacy&rdquo;; also
 <a href="#GeniSele">&sect;&sect;4.3&ndash;4.6</a>):</p>
 
<blockquote>

<p>
The transitions must be explained in terms of immediate selective
advantage to individual replicators: we are committed to the
gene-centred approach outlined by G. C. Williams (1966), and made
still more explicit by Dawkins (1976). (Maynard Smith &amp;
Szathm&aacute;ry 1995: 8)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The notion is that higher levels of entities may be
selected&mdash;i.e., be interactors, or perhaps even become attributed
to genes. The fact that such Adaptationist/KS school researchers seem
to be primarily focused on the unique reproductive capacities of the
upper-level entity (expanded to, e.g., the multicellular organism, or
family, or even superorganism, in ETI), explicitly to the detriment of
lower-level entities (see Clarke 2013, 2016, who conflates multilevel
selection and evolutionary transitions model-types and processes
throughout work on this
 topic,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-111" id="ref-111">111</a>]</sup>
 as do Sukhoverkhov &amp; Gontier
 2021;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-112" id="ref-112">112</a>]</sup>
 or Okasha 2006, 2022) should not surprise us (e.g., Gardner 2015a,b).
What is more surprising is that some insist that such genic
adaptation-forming processes are the <em>only</em> major multilevel
selection processes that produce or are involved in evolutionary
change (<em>contra</em>
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;4.1</a>,
 <a href="#SpecSele">&sect;4.2</a>,
 <a href="#HoloDemi">&sect;4.6</a>).</p>
 
<p>
On one analysis, the different stages of an evolutionary transition
involve different conceptions and model-types of multi-level selection
(Okasha 2006,
 2015).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-113" id="ref-113">113</a>]</sup>
 Under the first stage of multilevel selection (MLS1), the lower-level
entities (usually organisms) are the interactors as well as the
replicators/reproducers, while in MLS2, both the upper-level
collectives as well as the lower-level entities are independent
interactors. Thus, the issues surrounding evolutionary transitions
involve both the interactor question and the reproducer question, at
least. Unfortunately, as mentioned in
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;4.1</a>,
 there is conflation of interactor with manifestor in both sources
(Okasha 2006; Damuth &amp; Heisler 1988), thus also tying both
functional roles in with the reproducer RQ, confusing these
issues.</p>

<p>
On a different approach, ETI are seen as the appearance of a
&ldquo;new kind of <em>Darwinian populations</em>&hellip;. that can
enter into Darwinian processes in their own right&rdquo;
(Godfrey-Smith 2009: 122; emphasis added). Both the two-fold and
four-fold set of functional roles in evolutionary processes (isolated
by either Dawkins &amp; Hull, or Lloyd) are denied or neglected, and
it is directly denied that a <em>variety</em> of distinct units of
selection RQs exist
 (<a href="#InteReseQues">&sect;&sect;2.1&ndash;2.4</a>,
 <a href="#TwoTradReseMultUndeUnitSele">&sect;3</a>):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Questions about the &ldquo;unit&rdquo; of selection <em>are not
ambiguous</em>; the units in a selection process are just the entities
that make up a Darwinian population at that level. (Godfrey-Smith
2009: 111, emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The characteristics of &ldquo;<em>the</em> unit of selection&rdquo;
are then isolated (Godfrey-Smith 2009). In this view, as the essence
of the process of natural selection is the existence of
parent-offspring similarity between the elements that constitute a
Darwinian population, <em>the</em>
 (&ldquo;Unitary&rdquo;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-114" id="ref-114">114</a>]</sup>)
 unit of selection must be any element of a population of causally
interacting elements where the elements have the capacity of forming
parent-offspring lineages with at least a weak degree of
parent-offspring similarity (i.e., individuals that have the
&ldquo;capacity to reproduce&rdquo;, or &ldquo;reproducers&rdquo;,
under a definition modified from Griesemer; see Godfrey-Smith 2016:
10120). These elements are referred to as <em>Darwinian
 individuals</em><sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-115" id="ref-115">115</a>]</sup>,
 and to populations composed of Darwinian individuals as <em>Darwinian
 populations.</em><sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-116" id="ref-116">116</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Generally, in ETIs, the higher-level entities or populations must
engage in reproduction themselves, in which independent reproduction
and evolution at the lower-level is suppressed, as Maynard Smith and
Szathm&aacute;ry emphasized. These processes all involve restrictions
on the ability of the lower-level entities to function as interactors
and replicators/reproducers, and the emergence of upper-level
collectives <em>as simultaneous interactors, manifestors, and
replicators/reproducers</em>. But that is not how Godfrey-Smith
analyzes
 it.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-117" id="ref-117">117</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Thus, there is a variety of philosophical and biological approaches to
analyzing ETI on offer, whether in terms of reproducers, multilevel
selection, or Darwinian populations. The essential diachronic nature
of the problem poses a challenge for modeling, and involves not just
the interactor and replicator/reproducer questions, but also the
questions of who is the beneficiary of the selection process, whether
reproduction at the higher level constitutes a group-level engineering
adaptation, and how that new level of coordinated trait emerges.</p>

<p>
The clearest issues of interest emerging from these studies seem to
be:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>that the introduction of the &ldquo;reproducer&rdquo; as an
expansive concept of replicator was a major innovation (see Griesemer
1998, 2000c, 2003, 2005, with Godfrey Smith introducing a variation on
this in 2009, 2016);</li>

<li>the multilevel dynamics claimed to be appropriate in the
&ldquo;Evolutionary Transitions in Individuality&rdquo; (ETI)
tradition, (although the validity of these claims is under challenge),
which focus on reproduction of the higher-level entity in coordination
with suppression of its lower-level entity parts, seem not to be
broadly applicable to multilevel evolution in general; to treat them
as such introduces confusion into the debates about the units of
selection, as we see in the following section on holobiont
evolution.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="HoloDemi">4.6 Holobionts, and Demibionts</h3>

<p>
New ideas brought to notions of units of selection have grown out of
work from Margulis, Buss, Bordenstein, Thies, O&rsquo;Malley,
Dupr&eacute;, Griesemer, and evolutionary-developmental biologists
such as Rudolf Raff and Scott Gilbert, part of it taken up in
ecological community genetics modeling from the Evolutionary Change
school, and led to a recent focus on <em>holobionts</em>&mdash;a
eukaryotic host and its diverse microbial symbionts and
 associates.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-118" id="ref-118">118</a>]</sup>
 An expansive definition of holobionts, going beyond their role as
simple symbionts, is currently in wide use:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Microbial symbionts can be constant or inconstant, can be vertically
or horizontally transmitted, and can act in a context-dependent manner
as harmful, harmless, or helpful. (Theis et al. 2016:
 1;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-119" id="ref-119">119</a>]</sup>
 see Bruckner &amp; Bordenstein 2012, 2013a,b; Bordenstein &amp; Theis
2015)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Each &ldquo;individual&rdquo; human being is accompanied by a
community of organisms, some co-evolved for mutual benefit (Gilbert,
Sapp, &amp; Tauber 2012; Chiu &amp; Gilbert 2015; Gilbert
 2014).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-120" id="ref-120">120</a>]</sup>
 Our microbiota (bacteria, viruses, and fungi living in our gut,
mouth, and skin) is necessary for our survival and development; often,
our species is also needed, in turn, for their
 survival.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-121" id="ref-121">121</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Zilber-Rosenberg and Rosenberg (2008) were the
 first<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-122" id="ref-122">122</a>]</sup>
 to claim that holobionts were units of selection, but it was unclear
what precisely this claim meant, among the various possible meanings
and their combinations discussed in this entry. The holobiont as a
unit of selection was also accompanied by loosely-related, agitated
debates over whether and how it could be a biological
 individual<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-123" id="ref-123">123</a>]</sup>
 (see entries on
 <a href="../biology-individual/">biological individuals</a>
 and
 <a href="../evolution-development/">evolution and development</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Within the decade, discussions of holobionts as &ldquo;units of
selection&rdquo; appeared in the literature, notably, often
<em>objecting to</em> holobionts as units of selection (Moran &amp;
Sloan 2015; Douglas &amp; Werren 2016; Queller &amp; Strassmann 2016;
Skillings 2016; Burt &amp; Trivers 2006). However, it was rarely clear
which <em>exact</em> claim about holobionts as units was being
denied&mdash;was it about well-defined interactors, manifestors,
beneficiaries, reproducers, or some combination? Once specific
definitions were introduced into the debates researchers began to
offer both claims of filling the functional roles of interactors and
manifestors of adaptation selection and evolution among holobionts,
and demonstrating the empirical evidence supporting such claims
(Griesemer 2005, 2014, 2016; Bouchard 2009, 2010; Lloyd 2017; Gilbert,
Rosenberg, &amp; Zilber-Rosenberg 2017; Griesemer 2018; Roughgarden et
al. 2018; Su&aacute;rez &amp; Trivi&ntilde;o 2020). But there is a
more fundamental theoretical problem, arising from a specific
theoretical confusion with ETI
 (<a href="#UnitEvolTranIndi">&sect;4.5</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Explicit discussion and clarification of this central theoretical
question has been nearly completely neglected in the discussions of
holobionts as
 units:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-124" id="ref-124">124</a>]</sup>
 which evolutionary multilevel model-type(s) should we use to
represent holobiont evolution? A cross-time-scale emergent
hierarchical
 model-type,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-125" id="ref-125">125</a>]</sup>
 like the ETI Maynard Smith/Szathm&aacute;ry one discussed in
 <a href="#UnitEvolTranIndi">Section 4.5</a>,
 focusing on the emergence of new, higher-level-entity reproduction
combined with near-total suppression of the lower-level fitness/trait
significance? Or, instead, an ordinary-contemporary-timescale
Evolutionary Change multilevel/GS selection model-type, which does not
require such suppression, as we discussed in
 <a href="#TwoTradReseMultUndeUnitSele">&sect;3</a>
 and
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;4.1</a>?
 Or both, perhaps?</p>

<p>
As was highlighted in 2019 about this very issue in the context of
holobiont evolution:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The first confusion involves the attribution of &ldquo;evolutionary
transition&rdquo;-type, higher-order-entity selection as a
<em>necessary precondition</em> for holobiont evolution to have a
cooperative, mutualistic dimension (Stencel and Wloch-Salamon 2018).
In this view, a host and its loose association of microbes becomes a
holobiont only if it <em>first undergoes an evolutionary
transition</em>, because the holobiont must be <em>the primary unit of
selection</em> in order <em>to</em> <em>permit</em> the evolution of
<em>an adaptive mutualism</em> through the reciprocal coevolution of
its component species.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The Evolutionary Change school theorists characterizing and critiquing
this ETI view continue:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Without the primacy of holobiont-level selection, [it is believed]
<em>genomic conflict at lower-levels of selection sustains
disharmony</em> among the evolutionary interests of the component
species in a holobiont (Moran &amp; Sloan 2015; Douglas &amp; Werren
2016). (Lloyd &amp; Wade 2019: 3&ndash;4 of 20, emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Under this ETI approach to units of selection (discussed
 <a href="#UnitEvolTranIndi">&sect;4.5</a>),
 that we can now apply to holobiont selection, Maynard Smith and
Szathmary&rsquo;s ETI-style upper-level selection is required first,
which success depends upon the total choking-off of lower-level
entities through selection at that lower level, or else, it is
believed, as explained in
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;4.1</a>,
 &ldquo;cheater&rdquo; mutations that benefit from, but do not
contribute to, the upper-level group&mdash;here, the
holobiont&mdash;are thought to make mutualisms evolutionarily unstable
(Stencel &amp; Wloch-Salamon 2018).</p>

<p>
In contrast, a multilevel Evolutionary Change GS or hierarchical
 model-type<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-126" id="ref-126">126</a>]</sup>
 admitting the possibility of multiple, simultaneous levels of
selection at all stages of holobiont evolution, is <em>not</em>
dependent upon the <em>prior occurrence</em> of a major evolutionary
transition in individuality (ETI), and finds the introduction and
necessity of control of the &ldquo;<em>threat</em>&rdquo; of
&ldquo;<em>cheater</em>&rdquo; mutations to be a <em>fallacy</em>
 (<a href="#GrouSele">&sect;4.1</a>,
 <a href="#UnitEvolTranIndi">&sect;4.5</a>,
 <a href="#TwoTradReseMultUndeUnitSele">&sect;3</a>).</p>
 
<p>
This leaves us with at least two distinct theoretical RQs concerning
holobionts: (1) how should we conceive and answer questions about
whether any parts or combinations of multilevel, multispecies
holobiont systems serve as a unit of selection? and (2) which
functional roles do such units play? We will gloss several preliminary
answers for both RQs here, as well as views of some primary
 critics.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-127" id="ref-127">127</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
A holobiont has been claimed to sometimes be an &ldquo;integrated
community of species, [which] becomes a unit of natural
selection&rdquo; (Gilbert, Sapp, &amp; Tauber 2012: 334; Gilbert,
Rosenberg, Zilber-Rosenberg 2017). That is, theorists claim that the
holobiont can sometimes function as an evolutionary interactor, since
it has features <em>that bind it together as a whole</em> in such a
way that <em>its traits interact with its biotic and abiotic
environments, affecting the relative success of its reproducers</em>,
in a selective process.</p>

<p>
What ties or &ldquo;binds&rdquo; the different species together to
produce such an interactor in a selection process? According to
pioneering philosophical thought on holobionts and symbionts, it is
these species&rsquo; common evolutionary <em>fate</em>, the holobiont
acting as a &ldquo;<em>whole</em>&rdquo;, that characterizes it as an
evolutionary interactor, &ldquo;objects between which natural
selection selects&rdquo; (Dupr&eacute; 2012b: 160; 2021a,b; see also
Dupr&eacute; &amp; O&rsquo;Malley 2013; Griesemer 1998, 2000a,b,c;
Zilber-Rosenberg &amp; Rosenberg 2008; Su&aacute;rez 2020 emphasizes
the &ldquo;stability of traits&rdquo;; Schneider 2021; see Love 2018
et al.).</p>

<p>
The details of this biological description are filled out in various
instantiations of the model-type. This community can also be described
as a &ldquo;team&rdquo; undergoing selection (Gilbert, Rosenberg,
&amp; Zilber-Rosenberg 2017). Others describe them as
&ldquo;collaborators&rdquo; or &ldquo;polygenomic consortia&rdquo;,
which has the advantage of encompassing both competition and
cooperation within the holobiont (Dupr&eacute; &amp; O&rsquo;Malley
2013: 314; Dupr&eacute; 2021a,b; Theis et al. 2016; see also Huttegger
&amp; Smead 2011, game-theoretic results regarding the range of
collaboration). Note that all these descriptions are compatible with
being <em>simple interactors</em> at the combined level; and to call
them <em>cooperators</em>, and so on, here, does not necessarily
involve them in manifestor-style engineering higher-level adaptations,
i.e., this does not engage the
<em>manifestor-of-engineering-adaptation</em> functional role
 (<a href="#GrouSele">&sect;4.1</a>),
 as Wright made clear, as did Hamilton, and Wade (see Koskella &amp;
Bergelson 2020
 discussion).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-128" id="ref-128">128</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
And, anticipating many critics, Evolutionary Change multilevel
model-types representing holobionts do not identify a bottleneck, such
as vertical transmission, as either a cause or a necessary condition
for higher-level selection (e.g., Sober &amp; Wilson 1998;
Godfrey-Smith 2009, 2016, see below). Instead, multilevel selection
can provide a pathway for the evolution of transmission modes and
mating systems that enhance the efficacy of higher-level selection
while diminishing that of lower-level selection
 (<a href="#GrouSele">&sect;4.1</a>).
 Evolutionary Change multilevel selection models demonstrate the
emergence of holobiont dependencies which <em>precede and attend,
rather than follow</em>, mutualistic
 processes.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-129" id="ref-129">129</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
In contrast, some philosophers describe cases of ordinary group
selection, correctly modeled using perhaps kin-group selection or
multilevel GS model-types; they nevertheless describe phenomena in
those models as, &ldquo;key events in an evolutionary
transition&rdquo;, which they are not (Clarke 2016: 41). Because there
is no first-time upper-level, multi-cellular or multi-entity event
emerging along with these groups of organisms, calling them an ETI,
and using ETI-structured model-types to represent them, constitutes a
fundamental confusion (see also Herron 2021; Clarke 2013, 2016; Inkpen
&amp; Doolittle
 2021).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-130" id="ref-130">130</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
In fact, consideration of the problems with generalizing ETI models to
other evolutionary contexts such as holobionts re-invigorates the
four-fold taxonomy of the units of selection debates originally
introduced as an <em>epistemological and pragmatic</em> anatomy of RQs
based on the different types of
 processes/functions<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-131" id="ref-131">131</a>]</sup>
 that can affect different forms of biological organization
(Dupr&eacute; 2012a,b, 2021a,b).</p>

<p>
For example, take the requirement that one single entity-type
simultaneously satisfies <em>three</em> of the key functional
evolutionary roles, grounded in an Adaptationist/KS approach
 (<a href="#TwoTradReseMultUndeUnitSele">&sect;3</a>;
 Griesemer 2005; see meiotic drive in
 <a href="#GeniPlur">&sect;4.4</a>;
 Lloyd 1986, Hull 1988; Brandon 1988;
 <a href="#TwoTradReseMultUndeUnitSele">&sect;3</a>,
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;&sect;4.1&ndash;4.5</a>), which reduces evolution solely to a process that
produces engineering-type <em>adaptations</em>. Some see this type of
reduction as disconnected from a substantial number of genetic models
and biological <em>processes</em>, and one that matches badly with
contemporary experimental and theoretical biological practice
 (<a href="#TwoTradReseMultUndeUnitSele">&sect;3</a>
 &amp;
 <a href="#AnatDeba">&sect;4</a>).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-132" id="ref-132">132</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Given this latter, multilevel theoretical background, and the
prominence of debates about it, it seems somewhat surprising that it
has often been simply <em>assumed</em>, in the wide-ranging discussion
of holobionts, that Maynard Smith and Szathm&aacute;ry&rsquo;s
Adaptationist/KS, genic modeling approach was the <em>only</em>
approach available or appropriate (Moran &amp; Sloan 2015; Douglas
&amp; Werren 2016; Queller &amp; Strassmann 2016; Skillings 2016).
Alternative Evolutionary Change model-types, especially from community
genetics, have been available that make many fewer
empirically-unsupported or questionable assumptions&mdash;e.g., about
&ldquo;cheaters&rdquo;&mdash;regarding the biological systems in
question
 (<a href="#GrouSele">&sect;4.1</a>;
 Koskella &amp; Bergelson 2020; Bijma 2014; Drown &amp; Wade
2014).</p>

<p>
Some evolutionary biologists, for example, in applying Williams&rsquo;
&ldquo;parsimonious&rdquo; reductionist methods to holobionts
(specifically, mammalian gut microbiota; see
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;4.1</a>
 discussion of Williams&rsquo; parsimony principle), are explicit
about using Adaptationist/KS school model-types and assumptions,
claiming that &ldquo;the study of [adaptive] function provides
<strong><em>a universal logic</em></strong> to understand complex
biological
 systems&rdquo;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-133" id="ref-133">133</a>]</sup>
 (Foster et al. 2017: 2, Box 2).</p>

<p>
The holobionts are analyzed as <em>simultaneously filling three
evolutionary functional roles</em>: interactors, reproducers, and
manifestors of adaptation, in the active search for <em>optima</em>
that satisfy their requirements for adaptative, optimal results of
cooperation, stability and longevity of multispecies systems that are
always potentially fundamentally undermined by cheaters (Foster et al.
2017; they take an explicitly cheater-oriented approach to modeling
symbiotic evolutionary
 systems).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-134" id="ref-134">134</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
On this Adaptationist/KS approach, it is quite difficult to evolve
cooperation or mutualisms, despite mutualisms&rsquo; <em>complete
penetration and ubiquity in every system ever found in nature</em>;
the emphasis in their model-types is on the roles of cheaters and
selfish traits.</p>

<p>
One result appearing often in Adaptationist/KS school literature, is
that challenges to the &ldquo;stability of
transmission&rdquo;&mdash;partner choice of a symbiont&mdash;are
crucial to its long-term evolutionary success (Kaltenpoth et al. 2014;
Douglas &amp; Werren 2016; H. Williams &amp; Lenton
 2008).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-135" id="ref-135">135</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
This objection, that the symbiont or holobiont cannot evolve (as an
interactor, but especially as a both an interactor and a manifestor),
because transmission is unstable or unreliable&mdash;and thus that
strong or complete vertical transmission is required&mdash;is found
very frequently in conference and informal one-on-one discussions of
the possibilities of holobionts being units of selection, as well as
in the literature on this topic (e.g., Skillings 2016; Godfrey-Smith
2016; Douglas &amp; Werren 2016; Foster et al. 2017; van Vliet &amp;
Doebeli 2019).</p>

<p>
It has been established, however, through community genetics
model-types, that strong or complete verticality of transmission is
not, in fact, required for symbiont evolution, nor evolution of
mutualism, nor for holobiont evolution or stability, although it may
later
 emerge.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-136" id="ref-136">136</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Thus, while we find some researchers fruitfully framing their
model-types in the context of ecological modeling practices to better
understand microbiome evolution within vertebrates and other complex
hosts (e.g., Coyte, Schluter, &amp; Foster 2015; Costello et al. 2012;
Ley et al. 2008), others are stuck in unproductive model-types arising
from the ETI context, or fundamentals of the Adaptationist/KS school
modeling space that may make inappropriate and unproductive
assumptions.</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that even under the Evolutionary
Change and multilevel selection models, manifestors of adaptation may
be found at the holobiont level, as discussed in: Seeley (1997);
Wagner et al. 2014; Su&aacute;rez &amp; Trivi&ntilde;o (2020);
Dupressoir, Lavialle, &amp; Heidmann (2012); Lamm &amp; Kolodny
(2022).</p>

<p>
Within the practice of philosophy of biology, on the other hand, when
building a theoretical and analytical framework to examine whether or
not holobionts are units of selection, there is a tendency to
resurrect the anatomy analysis given here by those previously
following the &ldquo;Darwinian individuals&rdquo; approach, while
denying to do so; this can be found in a duo of philosopher &amp;
biologist:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We do not in general favor the replicator/interactor model (Hull 1980)
as the best or only way to understand selection, but it is worth
noting that it can be coherently employed in this context, and in a
way that is substantially different from other proposals. Lloyd
(201[8]), for example, conceives holobionts as interactors that
promote the differential success of the lineages of cells that make
them up. <em>We offer an</em> <em>alternative</em> in which holobionts
are seen as interactors that promote the differential success of the
interaction patterns they instantiate. The replicators in our model
are <em>abstract functional relationships</em>, not cell lineages.
(Doolittle &amp; Booth 2017: 18&ndash;19; emph. added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Since all the roles in the analysis in question are already abstract
and
 functional,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-137" id="ref-137">137</a>]</sup>
 the quoted material represents a misconception; the authors seem to
be in complete agreement with the definitions of the anatomy
analysis.</p>

<p>
Later, with a different philosopher, the biologist promotes a
process-centered approach to units of selection (Doolittle &amp;
Inkpen 2018; Suarez and Lloyd 2023). They again generalize the
functional roles of interactors in selection processes, but seem to
misunderstand the function-based tradition in which that project is
the norm (Dupr&eacute; 2012a, 2021a; Nicholson &amp; Dupr&eacute;
2018; Griesemer 2005).</p>

<p>
By 2021, these authors have adopted a particular units RQ as their
own, which appears to accept the beginnings of an anatomy analysis:
&ldquo;What are the referring replicators specifically responsible for
the differential extinction and proliferation of such higher-level
entities?&rdquo; i.e., of &ldquo;multi-species communities and
ecosystems&rdquo;. (Inkpen &amp; Doolittle 2021)</p>

<p>
But referring to replicators as being causally responsible for the
differential reproduction or extermination of any higher-level entity
requires their translation into interactors and their traits first, as
Dawkins himself recognized and claimed (see
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;&sect;4.1&ndash;4.4</a>).
 These authors seem to be making the same fundamental omission as the
genic pluralists, in thinking that reproducers as ultimate
beneficiaries&mdash;or as serving foundational roles&mdash;are
<em>directly exposed</em> to selection forces themselves
 (<a href="#GeniSele">&sect;4.3</a>,
 <a href="#GeniPlur">&sect;4.4</a>).</p>

<p>
They thus leave out the names and descriptions of the fully
dynamically and explanatorily essential functional parts of the
anatomy analysis&mdash;<em>beneficiaries, reproducers,
interactors,</em> and <em>manifestors</em> <em>of
adaptation</em>&mdash;even though these authors <em>utilize all
four</em> of these functional roles in their theoretical exploration
and explanation (Inkpen &amp; Doolittle 2021). Omitting naming them is
not an advance in clarity or understanding, it is a confusion echoing
those in
 <a href="#GeniPlur">Section 4.4</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Evolutionary Change modelers thus conclude that applying the ETI
model-type to holobionts as units of selection (regarding any of the
four distinct units RQs or their combos), as done by the opponents to
granting holobionts status as units, is <em>not</em> generally
suitable for modeling holobionts, demibionts or symbionts, for reasons
that are familiar from the weaknesses of genic interpretations of
multilevel model-types generally. For example, such model-types do not
fully incorporate relevant gene interaction&mdash;e.g., IGE or sources
of epistasis&mdash;in their models (see Koskella &amp; Bergelson 2020;
 <a href="#GrouSele">&sect;4.1</a>;
 Bijma 2014; S. Wright 1931, 1980; Wade 2016).</p>

<p>
<em>Leaving out</em> the necessary gene- or entity-interactions among
participant species or higher-level entities, it is no wonder that the
ETI-oriented models do not get the empirically or theoretically
representative answers about upper-level properties.</p>

<p>
There are thus crucial differences between the outcomes of the two
schools&rsquo; model-types. The community or multilevel genetics
model-types (incorporating IGE or epistasis) show <em>how</em> the
assumed <em>conflict</em> in the ETI model-type that shows between
genomes (e.g., Douglas &amp; Werren 2016; Moran &amp; Sloan 2015), can
be <em>self-limiting</em> in the Evolutionary Change model-types,
while <em>cooperation and mutualism tend to be self-accelerating</em>,
precisely contrary to the predictions of the ETI model-types, i.e.,
those used by the opponents to holobionts as interactors, reproducers,
or manifestors as units of selection (Drown &amp; Wade 2014; Wade
&amp; Drown 2015; see theory in Wade 2016).</p>

<p>
These very biases in the evolutionary dynamics of interaction between
hosts and microbiota are an important feature of holobionts, and could
contribute to explaining the <em>absence of cheaters</em> from natural
mutualisms, although cheaters are predicted by gene-centered conflict
theory to <em>cause the strong evolutionary instability</em> of
mutualisms, as mentioned in Section 4.1 (see Foster et al. 2017).
Recall from
 <a href="#GrouSele">Sections 4.1&ndash;4.5</a>
 that, according to the Evolutionary Change school, problems with GS
and KS model-types from cheaters were a fallacy. Recall also that
these cheaters also <em>cannot be found in nature</em>, when those
researchers most committed to their existence went to find
 them.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-138" id="ref-138">138</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
It is important to see that in addition to filling the functional
roles of interactors or manifestors, holobionts can also be
reproducers, where the host usually reproduces vertically and the
microbiota reproduce vertically, horizontally, or
 both.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-139" id="ref-139">139</a>]</sup>
 This situation has provoked discussion especially among
 philosophers.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-140" id="ref-140">140</a>]</sup>
 Holobionts&rsquo; microbiota often reproduce outside the context of
the original host organism, and some holobionts, e.g., the Hawaiian
bobtail squid and its luminescent bacteria, are not seen as
&ldquo;Darwinian populations&rdquo; (Godfrey-Smith 2009, 2016), and
therefore are judged not to be units of selection under that view (see
Booth 2014).</p>

<p>
Others instead distinguish between holobionts and
&ldquo;demibionts&rdquo;. In contrast with the adaptive-neutral
concept of the holobiont, a <em>demibiont</em> recognizes the
possibility of an asymmetric evolutionary history, in which the
combination evolves such that one or more lineages has adapted to the
first, but the first has not adapted to the others (see Su&aacute;rez
&amp; Stencel
 2020).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-141" id="ref-141">141</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
This approach contrasts with that of the original reproducer and
&ldquo;Darwinian population&rdquo; approaches, which would exclude
demibionts given the specific requirements concerning reproduction
(Griesemer 2000a, 2016; Godfrey-Smith 2016; Booth 2014). The Darwinian
population view excludes such holobionts and demibionts, because
&ldquo;it is a mistake to see things that do not reproduce as units of
selection&rdquo; (Godfrey-Smith 2011: 509). Note that this conclusion
rests on the merging of the interactor (and manifestor) with the
reproducer requirements, and as such will not hold sway over those who
do not buy such a confounding of roles (e.g., Dupr&eacute; &amp;
O&rsquo;Malley 2013; Su&aacute;rez &amp; Lloyd 2023). This is yet
another case wherein distinguishing the interactor RQ from the
replicator/reproducer RQ can be &ldquo;more
 illuminating&rdquo;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-142" id="ref-142">142</a>]</sup>
 (Sterelny 2011: 496)</p>

<p>
In sum, both the ETI model-type, inappropriately, and the
Adaptationist/KS gene-centric, species-centric approach&mdash;based in
genomic conflict and the threat of &ldquo;cheaters&rdquo;&mdash;have
been predominant in critiques of <em>holobionts</em> <em>as units of
selection</em> under all four RQs discussed in this entry, and have
been resisted by advocates using Evolutionary Change model-types,
whose models fit the available empirical data concerning what is
turning out to be the universal partially-coevolutionary systems
called <em>holobionts</em>.</p>

<h2 id="Conc">5. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
We should not treat different answers as competitors if they are
answering different questions. I offer a framework of four distinct
Research Questions to clarify the &ldquo;units of selection&rdquo;
debates. We separate the classic question about the unit of
evolutionary selective interaction (interactor question), from the
entity functioning as a replicating/reproducing unit (reproducer
question), and also from which entity acquires
&ldquo;engineering&rdquo; adaptations (manifestor-of-adaptation
question). We note the ambiguity in &ldquo;adaptation&rdquo;: is
adaptation a selection product versus an accumulated
&ldquo;engineering&rdquo; design? Finally, we consider the ultimate
beneficiary, &ldquo;in the long run&rdquo;, from the evolution by
selection process (beneficiary question). Many
misunderstandings&mdash;theoretical and empirical&mdash;may be avoided
by a precise characterization of which of the four units of selection
questions, or their combinations, is being addressed, and by which
multilevel school&rsquo;s approach.</p>

<h1>Moral Decision-Making Under Uncertainty</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Mar 13, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Many important debates in contemporary ethics centre on idealized
thought experiments in which agents are assumed to have perfect
information about the effects of their actions and other morally
relevant features of the choices they face. If Abe turns the trolley,
one person will certainly be killed; if he does not, five people will
certainly be killed (Foot 1967); how the one and the five got into
that situation, whether blamelessly or recklessly (Thomson 1976:
210&ndash;11), is also a matter of certainty. If Betty conceives a
child now, it will certainly have a life that is hard but worth
living, while if she waits, her child&rsquo;s life will certainly be
better&mdash;and the two choices will certainly result in
<em>different</em> children being born (Parfit 1984: 358).</p>

<p>
These debates, focused on conditions of certainty, often suggest
principles that are hard to generalize to conditions of
<em>un</em>certainty. If it is always wrong to kill an innocent person
(even to save more innocent people), how do we evaluate actions that
carry a <em>risk</em> (perhaps minuscule) of killing an innocent
person? If there is a moral obligation (all else being equal) not to
bring <em>bad</em> lives into existence, but no obligation to bring
<em>good</em> lives into existence, what do we say in situations where
it is uncertain whether some potential future life will be bad or
good? And what if we are uncertain about the relevant moral principles
themselves?</p>

<p>
While uncertainty creates challenges for ethicists, ethical
considerations also raise distinctive challenges for standard
principles of decision-making under uncertainty. Orthodox decision
theory advises <em>expected utility maximization</em> as the rational
response to uncertainty. But expected utility maximization may seem
infeasible in ethical contexts due to the complexity of the morally
significant effects of even ordinary choices (Lenman 2000; Greaves
2016). It may give implausible weight to small probabilities of
astronomically good or bad outcomes, like human extinction (Balfour
2021). It may struggle to accommodate certain aspects of
non-consequentialist moral theories, like absolute moral constraints,
permissions to act suboptimally, and the moral significance of
unrealized risks (Hansson 2003; Lazar 2017a; Tenenbaum 2017). And it
is unclear how, if at all, to extend expected utility theory to
accommodate uncertainty about morality itself (Gracely 1996; Hedden
2016).</p>

<p>
These questions are not just theoretically interesting but practically
important. For morally motivated agents who care about making the
world a better place, treating others fairly and respecting their
rights, and so on, different principles for moral decision-making
under uncertainty can yield very different advice. Whether such agents
ought to prioritize the near-term or long-term effects of their
actions might depend on how much weight they give to small
probabilities of extreme outcomes, and how they deal with the
unpredictability of long-term, indirect effects. Their dietary choices
may depend on how they deal with uncertainty about the moral status of
animals. And the problems of uncertainty may also be epistemically
relevant to first-order moral questions&mdash;both consequentialism
and deontology, for instance, have been accused of having no plausible
way of dealing with uncertainty.</p>

<p>
This entry will survey some of the central questions concerning moral
decision-making under uncertainty. There are many active debates in
this area, and we won&rsquo;t be able to cover them all. Instead, we
have tried to focus on problems that have both general philosophical
significance (affecting a wide range of ethical views) and practical
significance (making a difference to important real-world
choices).</p>

<p>
We begin in
 <a href="#ObjeSubjProsOugh">section 1</a>
 by distinguishing several kinds of normative assessment for actions
under uncertainty: &ldquo;fact-relative&rdquo; vs.
&ldquo;belief-relative&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;evidence-relative&rdquo;, and
moral vs. rational.
 <a href="#ExpeUtilTheoEthi">Section 2</a>
 then describes the orthodox normative theory of decision-making under
uncertainty outside of ethics, namely, expected utility theory, and
considers its potential applications to ethics. The subsequent
sections each consider distinctive features of <em>morally
motivated</em> decision-making under uncertainty that challenge
straightforward applications of expected utility theory, and suggest
the need for either modifications or entirely different approaches in
the ethical context.
 <a href="#ClueDeepUnce">Section 3</a>
 considers the apparent impossibility of applying
expected-utility-like criteria to real-world ethical decision-making
given the many long-term, indirect effects of even mundane choices.
This difficulty, sometimes called the &ldquo;problem of
cluelessness&rdquo;, has been seen as posing a particular challenge to
(impartial, agent-neutral) consequentialism, which gives full weight
to these indirect effects. In contrast,
 <a href="#MoraConsUndeRisk">section 4</a>
 considers some of the difficulties of incorporating
<em>non</em>-consequentialist considerations into a theory of moral
decision-making under uncertainty&mdash;in particular, agent-centred
constraints, the moral significance of risk imposition, and the aim of
respecting other agents&rsquo; preferences with respect to risk and
uncertainty.
 <a href="#MoraUnce">Section 5</a>
 considers how (if at all) agents should take account of their
uncertainty about morality itself. Finally,
 <a href="#SmalProbExtrStak">section 6</a>
 considers a problem that afflicts consequentialists,
non-consequentialists, and the morally uncertain alike: the
possibility that moral decision-making under uncertainty comes to be
implausibly dominated by low-probability, high-stakes moral
considerations (like tiny probabilities of securing an astronomically
good outcome or violating an extremely weighty moral constraint).</p>

<h2 id="ObjeSubjProsOugh">1. Objective, Subjective, and Prospective &ldquo;oughts&rdquo;</h2>

<p>
The following classic example illustrates both the need for a theory
of moral choice under uncertainty, and some of its desirable
features.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Jill is a physician who has to decide on the correct treatment for her
patient, John, who has a minor but not trivial skin complaint. She has
three drugs to choose from: drug <i>A</i>, drug <i>B</i>, and drug
<i>C</i>. Careful consideration of the literature has led her to the
following opinions. Drug <i>A</i> is very likely to relieve the
condition but will not completely cure it. One of drugs <i>B</i> and
<i>C</i> will completely cure the skin condition; the other though
will kill the patient, and there is no way that she can tell which of
the two is the perfect cure and which the killer drug. What should
Jill do? (Jackson 1991:
 462&ndash;3)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here is a natural answer: In one sense, Jill ought to prescribe
whichever drug is in fact the perfect cure&mdash;either <i>B</i> or
<i>C</i>. This is what would have the best consequences for John
(which seems to be all that is morally at stake); it is also what a
fully informed and morally ideal version of Jill would do. Call this
the &ldquo;fact-relative&rdquo; or &ldquo;objective&rdquo; sense of
&ldquo;ought&rdquo;. But this objective standard cannot be the
<em>only</em> morally relevant standard in this case. For one thing,
it&rsquo;s not the standard that determines praise or blame: We would
not blame Jill for prescribing drug <i>A</i>, and we <em>would</em>
blame her for prescribing either <i>B</i> or <i>C</i>, even if she got
lucky and prescribed the curative rather than the fatal drug. For
another thing, a moral injunction to prescribe the drug that in fact
has the best consequences does not seem <em>useful</em> from
Jill&rsquo;s perspective&mdash;she cannot act on that advice, given
her ignorance. And it seems that morality should, among other things,
give agents usable guidance in morally important choice
 situations.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 So there must also be at least one importance sense in which Jill
morally ought to prescribe drug <i>A</i>&mdash;even though this is the
one option that is certain <em>not</em> to effect a perfect cure.
Given her uncertainty, it would be wrong (in this sense) to risk
John&rsquo;s life when there is an imperfect but safe alternative in
drug <i>A</i>. This article is concerned with this general type of
verdict about what one ought to do, taking uncertainty into
account.</p>

<p>
There are some important questions about what uncertainty we are
talking about here. We could focus on Jill&rsquo;s <em>beliefs</em>
about the efficacy of the drugs; insofar as uncertainty is to be
understood in probabilistic terms, the decision-relevant probabilities
would be Jill&rsquo;s credences (or &ldquo;degrees of belief&rdquo; or
&ldquo;subjective probabilities&rdquo;). We would then be asking what
Jill ought to do in a &ldquo;belief-relative&rdquo; or
&ldquo;subjective&rdquo; sense of &ldquo;ought&rdquo;. One common
alternative is to focus on Jill&rsquo;s <em>evidence</em> about the
efficacy of the drugs; the decision-relevant probabilities will then
be <em>evidential probabilities</em> representing how likely various
possibilities are on Jill&rsquo;s evidence. We would then be asking
what Jill ought to do in an &ldquo;evidence-relative&rdquo; or
&ldquo;prospective&rdquo; sense of &ldquo;ought&rdquo;. (The term
&ldquo;prospective&rdquo; is due to Zimmerman [2008].) These two
questions could come apart if Jill failed to proportion her credences
to her evidence. (In certain circumstances, too, one might wish to
focus on the <em>evaluator&rsquo;s</em> beliefs or evidence, or on the
<em>available</em> evidence, rather than on features of the
agent.)</p>

<p>
Some philosophers think that &ldquo;ought&rdquo; is univocal, and that
we must decide between objective, subjective, and prospective accounts
of
 it.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 Others think that there are multiple legitimate senses of
&ldquo;ought&rdquo;, including two or more of the objective,
subjective, and prospective senses. (In a useful discussion of these
questions, Sepielli (2018b) calls the former group
&ldquo;debaters&rdquo; and the latter group &ldquo;dividers&rdquo;.) A
similar range of positions is possible concerning other normative
terms and concepts besides <em>ought</em>, like <em>rightness</em> or
 <em>reasons</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 In this article, we mostly steer clear of these debates. But we do
unavoidably take for granted that there is <em>some</em> normative
standard for evaluating morally significant choices that is sensitive
to an agent&rsquo;s beliefs and/or
 evidence.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<p>
A further question is whether the standards in play are <em>moral</em>
standards, <em>rational</em> standards, or something else. We can ask,
for instance, what Jill morally ought to do, given her uncertainty.
But we can instead ask what it would be rational for her to do, given
her uncertainty together with her moral commitments; or, we can ask
what it would be rational for a morally conscientious person to do in
her position. Such questions are still relevant to moral
decision-making. (For a recent discussion, see Bykvist 2020.) Most of
the discussion in this entry can be interpreted as addressing any one
of these questions, although the distinction between them is
especially relevant when it comes to <em>moral uncertainty</em>, the
topic of
 <a href="#MoraUnce">section 5</a>.
 Thus, in the rest of the entry, we will frame various substantive
questions about moral choice under uncertainty in terms of what an
agent <em>ought</em> to do or what she is <em>permitted</em> to do,
while intending to be flexible about whether the relevant standards
are belief-relative or evidence-relative, and rational or moral.</p>

<p>
Though we can distinguish between objective and non-objective
assessments of actions under uncertainty, it is natural to think that
there is some tight relationship between the two. For instance, if you
are <em>sure</em> that you objectively ought to \(\varphi\), then you
subjectively ought to \(\varphi\). And if it is certain on your
evidence that you objectively ought to \(\varphi\), then you
prospectively ought to \(\varphi\). A natural generalization of these
weak claims is that, in light of your uncertainty, you ought to do
whatever is most likely to be the thing you objectively ought to
do.</p>

<p>
The central point of Jackson&rsquo;s case, however, is that this view
is wrong. Given her uncertainty, Jill ought to prescribe drug
<i>A</i>, the one option that is certain to be objectively wrong. In
fact, even the weak claims may require qualification. If we allow
&ldquo;\(\varphi\)&rdquo; to stand for &ldquo;not prescribe
<i>A</i>&rdquo;, then, given her uncertainty, it is not true that Jill
ought to \(\varphi\), even though it is certain that she objectively
ought to \(\phi\).</p>

<p>
What should we say instead? When thinking about Jill&rsquo;s
situation, we note that although there is a good chance that
prescribing drug <i>B</i> (say) is objectively right (because it would
do a little better than drug <i>A</i>), there is also a good chance
that it would be objectively wrong, and to a grievous extent (because
it would kill John). What Jill ought to do seems to be a matter of
weighing these positive and negative considerations against each
other, both in terms of their probability and in terms of their moral
seriousness. One simple approach to this sort of weighing is given by
expected utility theory, a topic to which we now turn.</p>

<h2 id="ExpeUtilTheoEthi">2. Expected Utility Theory in Ethics</h2>

<p>
Expected utility theory is the orthodox normative theory of choice
under uncertainty. (There is really a family of slightly different
theories, but we will gloss over the differences here.) It is
typically understood as a theory about the structure of a rational
agent&rsquo;s preferences. The same formal theory can, however, be
repurposed as a theory about the structure of permissibility, or of
what an agent ought to do, and that is how we will present it here.
Perhaps there is a connection between these two applications of the
formal theory: perhaps what you ought to do corresponds, more or less,
to what you would prefer to do if you were rational and suitably
motivated. However, it is a substantive question whether any such
correspondence holds, and how to spell it out; we circumvent this
issue by thinking directly in terms of permissibility.</p>

<p>
Expected utility theory can then be understood as making the following
claims. Each option leads to various possible outcomes with various
probabilities. (Here, an &ldquo;outcome&rdquo; might include the act
itself and such details as the identity and motives of the agent.) For
each possible outcome \(O\), there is a number \(U(O)\), its
<em>utility</em> (about which we will have much more to say below).
The higher \(U(O)\) is, the more reason there is to bring about \(O\)
rather than any
 alternative.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
 So, in a choice where the outcome of each option is certain, one
ought to choose an option that leads to the outcome with the highest
utility. Moreover, in cases where the outcomes of some options are
uncertain, one ought to choose an option with the highest
<em>expected</em> utility, where the expected utility \(\EU(A)\) of an
option \(A\) is the probability-weighted sum of the utilities of its
possible outcomes:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag4em">
<dt>\(\EU(A)\)</dt>
<dd> the sum, over possible outcomes \(O\), of the utility of \(O\)
times the probability that \(O\) is the outcome of \(A\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
(For simplicity of formulation, we assume that \(A\) has only finitely
many possible outcomes.)</p>

<p>
Before proceeding to some interpretive issues, let us illustrate this
view by applying it to Jackson&rsquo;s case:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Suppose that <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> are equally likely to be the
perfect cure. Suppose the utility of John&rsquo;s death is \(-100\)
(there is strong reason to avoid it), the utility of a perfect cure is
\(+100\) (there is strong reason to achieve it), and the utility of a
partial cure is \(+90\) (there is slightly weaker reason to achieve
it). Then Pill <i>B</i> and Pill <i>C</i> each have an expected
utility of 0 \((100\times 0.5 0 + (-100)\times 0.5),\) while Pill
<i>A</i> has an expected utility of 90 \((90\times 0.5 + 90 \times
0.5).\) Therefore Jill ought to treat John with Pill <i>A</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As one can see in this example, expected utility maximization provides
a &ldquo;criterion of right&rdquo;: it says what the agent ought to
do. But it can also, at least in simple cases, provide a decision
procedure: the agent can figure out what to do by applying the
expected utility formula (or else by reasoning in terms of the axioms
that we will mention below). Some criticisms of expected utility
theory (and of similar theories) in the moral context can best be
understood as objections to it as a criterion of rightness, and others
as objections to it as a decision procedure. (The distinction between
&ldquo;criteria of right&rdquo; and &ldquo;decision procedures&rdquo;
is due to R. Eugene Bales [1971].)</p>

<p>
We have seen how to reason with utilities. But what <em>are</em>
utilities? And why think that the permissible options are exactly the
ones that maximize their expectation? These questions are arguably
best treated together. Foundational treatments of expected utility
theory typically proceed by proving a &ldquo;representation
theorem&rdquo;: if permissibility has certain <em>prima facie</em>
plausible structural properties (and given certain background
assumptions of a more technical nature), then there exists a (more or
less unique) utility function such that the permissible options are
precisely those that maximize expected
 utility.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 According to this story, the utilities are functionally characterized
by their role in the expected utility formula, and the existence of
utilities fulfilling this role is guaranteed by the more basic
structural axioms. Notably, then, expected utility theory does not
require a moral theory to <em>explicitly</em> assign a utility to each
outcome, and the claim that <em>there exists</em> an appropriate
utility function is a mathematical claim about the structure of
permissibility, not one that signals a further metaphysical
commitment.</p>

<p>
This is not the place for a detailed discussion of the relevant
axioms, but let us informally state a few important ones to give the
flavour:</p>

<dl class="partag indent">
<dt><em>Contraction consistency</em></dt>
<dd> If it is permissible to choose <i>A</i> from some set of options,
then it is permissible to choose <i>A</i> from any subset of those
options that includes <i>A</i>.</dd>
<dt><em>Expansion consistency</em></dt>
<dd> If <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are both permissible choices from some
set of options, then, from any larger set of options, they are either
both permissible or both
 impermissible.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup>
 </dd>
<dt><em>Stochasticism</em></dt>
<dd>Which options are permissible in a given choice situation depends
only on which possible outcomes the options lead to, and with what
probabilities.</dd>
<dt><em>Continuity</em></dt>
<dd>If it is impermissible to choose <i>A</i> from some set of
options, then it would still be impermissible if the probabilities
were very slightly different.</dd>
<dt><em>The sure thing principle</em></dt>
<dd> If, in a given choice situation, one has no influence on whether
<i>E</i> occurs, and one ought to choose <i>A</i> on the supposition
that <i>E</i> occurs, and one ought to choose <i>A</i> on the
supposition that <i>E</i> does not occur, then one ought to choose
 <i>A</i>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup></dd>
 </dl>

<p>
Although axioms of this kind are, at least at first sight, fairly
ecumenical, it will be obvious that expected utility theory has a
special affinity with maximizing act consequentialism. It is tempting
to think of the utility of an outcome as representing the
<em>value</em> or <em>goodness</em> of that outcome, in the sense dear
to consequentialists; then, expected utility theory provides a natural
way to understand consequentialism in the face of uncertainty. And it
is true that moral theorists whose views depart widely from
consequentialism will be especially motivated to modify or supplement
expected utility theory. For just one example, expected utility
theory, being a maximizing theory, does not seem to allow for an
interesting notion of moral supererogation. (At an axiomatic level,
the maximizing flavour of the theory follows from contraction and
expansion consistency; see
 <a href="notes.html#note-8">note 8</a>.)
 We will return to subtler problems along these lines in
 <a href="#MoraConsUndeRisk">section 4</a>.</p>
 
<p>
However, the connection between expected utility theory and
consequentialism is not a tight one. Consequentialists as well as
others may wish to consider alternatives to (or generalizations of)
expected utility theory, including ones that allow for
&ldquo;global&rdquo; forms of risk aversion (typically violating the
sure thing
 principle<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>);
 infinite values (typically violating
 continuity<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup>);
 or incommensurability and similar phenomena (typically violating
expansion consistency and perhaps
 stochasticism<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>).
 Moreover, the types of worries that we raise below about expected
utility theory (and which apply to many variations of it) will move
some consequentialists as well as non-consequentialists.</p>

<p>
Conversely, nothing requires us to claim that the utility of an
outcome represents its goodness. In general, the utility of <i>O</i>
must represent something like the &ldquo;choiceworthiness&rdquo; or
strength of reasons for choosing <i>O</i>, which need not be cashed
out in consequentialist terms. For example, we noted above that things
like the identity of the agent can be treated as part of each outcome.
So, at a minimum, the utility of <i>O</i> can reflect some
agent-relative considerations that standard forms of consequentialism
exclude (cf. Brown 2011: 760&ndash;763). We will say more about
non-consequentialist applications of expected utility theory in
 <a href="#MoraConsUndeRisk">section 4</a>.</p>
 
<p>
One further subtlety is worth mentioning. We have said that \(U(O)\)
represents the choiceworthiness of <i>O</i>; all this means, however,
is that more choiceworthy outcomes have higher utility. It
doesn&rsquo;t follow that an outcome that is, say, <em>twice</em> as
choiceworthy (by whatever measure) must have twice the utility. For
example, a total utilitarian might identify the choiceworthiness of an
outcome with its total welfare, but in combining total utilitarianism
with expected utility theory it is not logically required that an
outcome with twice the total welfare must have twice the utility: in
principle, <i>U</i> could be <em>any</em> increasing function of total
welfare. Another way to put this point is that, even if permissibility
is governed by expected utility theory, we are not necessarily
required to be <em>risk neutral</em> with respect to choiceworthiness;
perhaps we ought to be risk averse, risk seeking, or some
 mix.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup>
 Still, when utility does agree with some independently given measure
of choiceworthiness or goodness we may refer to &ldquo;expected
choiceworthiness&rdquo; or &ldquo;expected value&rdquo; instead of
&ldquo;expected utility&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Finally, classic work related to expected utility theory illustrates
the following general lesson: views about moral decision-making under
uncertainty can inform and constrain our views about moral
decision-making even in the absence of uncertainty. Key examples are
provided by Harsanyi&rsquo;s aggregation theorem (Harsanyi 1955, 1977)
and the subsequent literature. Harsanyi derived a form of
utilitarianism, using expected utility theory, impartiality, and the
<em>ex ante</em> Pareto principle as essentially the only premises.
(The <em>ex ante</em> Pareto principle says, roughly, that one option
ought to be chosen over another if it is better for each person
separately, taking uncertainty into account. Importantly,
Harsanyi&rsquo;s utilitarianism is restricted to fixed populations,
i.e., it does not tell us how to compare populations of different size
or with different membership.) See Broome (1991) for a classic
philosophical development of Harsanyi&rsquo;s theorem, and Greaves
(2017) for further discussion of the connection between
Harsanyi&rsquo;s result and classical utilitarianism. This result has
been extremely influential in distributive ethics and population
ethics, including the economics-based literature on &ldquo;social
choice&rdquo;. As a small sample from a vast literature:
Harsanyi&rsquo;s approach has been extended to treat
variable-population cases, whether in a utilitarian vein (e.g., Broome
2004; Blackorby, Bossert, &amp; Donaldson 2005) or a
non-consequentialist, person-affecting one (e.g., Thomas 2023); and to
allow for more general forms of utilitarianism (e.g., McCarthy,
Mikkola, &amp; Thomas 2020). Moreover, his theorem and associated
ideas have been used to clarify what is at stake in debates between
different distributive views such as egalitarianism and
prioritarianism (e.g., Diamond 1967; Myerson 1981; Otsuka &amp;
Voorhoeve 2009; McCarthy 2015, 2017).</p>

<h2 id="ClueDeepUnce">3. Cluelessness and Deep Uncertainty</h2>

<p>
Now we turn to a fairly general problem about decision-making under
uncertainty. The problem is arguably most severe for maximizing act
consequentialism and similar theories; insofar as this is true, it
further illustrates how thinking about choice under uncertainty can
inform our moral theorizing. A broader lesson is that there are
arguably a number of forms of &ldquo;deep uncertainty&rdquo; that are
highly relevant to moral decision-making but seem to evade simple
probabilistic models like the one implicit in standard forms of
expected utility theory.</p>

<p>
The problem, in brief, is that we often feel clueless about the
long-term (or otherwise non-immediate) consequences of our actions;
insofar as what we ought to do depends on those consequences, this
suggests that we are often clueless about what we ought to do. Such
&ldquo;cluelessness&rdquo; has been seen by some as an objectionable
feature of moral theories&mdash;including, but not limited to,
standard forms of act consequentialism&mdash;that give significant
weight to such long-term consequences. Why objectionable? Perhaps a
desideratum for a moral theory is that it usually provides actionable
advice. More specifically, though, insofar as we <em>are</em> clueless
about the long-term effects of our actions, it seems plausible that we
should be able to reliably figure out what to do by simply ignoring
those effects. But it is at least unclear how act consequentialism
(and theories that worry about consequences in a similar way) can
license such a move. This objection was developed at length by Lenman
(2000), starting from a line of thought sketched but not endorsed by
Kagan (1998: 64).</p>

<p>
One natural interpretation of &ldquo;cluelessness&rdquo; is that one
has <em>no evidence</em> concerning the relevant consequences. Suppose
right now I can pick up a pen either with my left hand or with my
right. For the sake of illustration let us grant that it is
predictable that, through the &ldquo;butterfly effect&rdquo;, doing
one of these actions rather than the other will lead to a greater
number of destructive typhoons over the next millennium. Nonetheless,
I seem to have no evidence whatsoever <em>which</em> action would do
so. To put it another way, when it comes to typhoons, the evidence in
favour of using my left hand seems to be perfectly symmetrical with
the evidence in favour of using my right. Surely, then, no matter how
bad the additional typhoons would be, I can simply set this
consideration aside. However, this conclusion appears to rely on a
&ldquo;principle of indifference&rdquo; to the effect that, given my
lack of evidence, the probability that my left hand leads to more
typhoons is the same as the probability that my right hand does.
Tempting as this may be, indifference principles are
&ldquo;notoriously vexed&rdquo; (Lenman 2000: 354; see also section
4.2 of the entry on
 <a href="../epistemology-bayesian/">Bayesian epistemology</a>)
 and part of Lenman&rsquo;s argument is scepticism that a strong
enough indifference principle is available. Greaves (2016), in
contrast, defends indifference reasoning in cases like this of
&ldquo;simple cluelessness&rdquo; involving evidential symmetry.
However, she thinks that there is still a problem with cases of
&ldquo;complex&rdquo; cluelessness, cases in which there is different
evidence pointing in each direction but it is unclear how to weigh it
up. Even if Greaves is right that simple cluelessness is
unproblematic, this may not help much, if genuine evidential symmetry
is not the normal case (Yim 2019; Greaves 2016, VII).</p>

<p>
Diagnosing cluelessness in terms of a lack of evidence or in terms of
complex evidence still does not tell us why cluelessness about
consequences leads to cluelessness about what one ought to do. Indeed,
as we have seen, a moral theory&rsquo;s verdicts about what we ought
to do often take into account uncertainty about the consequences of
our actions. So, uncertainty about the consequences of our actions
does not imply uncertainty about what we ought to do. For example,
Jackson&rsquo;s doctor is uncertain what pill will have the best
consequences for her patient, but nonetheless knows, in light of that
uncertainty, which pill she ought to prescribe. To generate a problem,
the sense in which we are clueless about the long-term consequences of
our actions must have some upshot that makes it harder to deal with
than other sources of
 uncertainty.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<p>
One possible upshot of cluelessness is that the decision-relevant
probabilities are hard to know or even to estimate precisely. The
issue of precision is important, as is the idea that the long-term
consequences of one&rsquo;s actions can have large (perhaps even
infinite!) value. One might have thought that most of our actions will
turn out to have little net impact on the far future: the effects die
out (or cancel out) over time &ldquo;like ripples in a pond&rdquo;
(Smart 1973: 33). Lenman argues against this claim, based in part on
the common view that the identities of future people depend
sensitively on what we do now. Instead, at least some possible
consequences of our actions have very high value, systematically
affecting many people over a long span of time. But if some possible
consequence of our choice is large in value, then a small change in
the probability of that consequence will make for a large change in
expected value. If you cannot estimate the probabilities very
precisely, then, you could be clueless about the expected values of
your options and about what you ought to do.
 <sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup>
 When thinking about long-term consequences, such precise estimates
seem hard to come by. (We&rsquo;ve phrased this and much of the rest
of the discussion in terms of expected value maximization, but it
should be clear that the issues are more general.)</p>

<p>
This kind of problem can obviously arise if the decision-relevant
probabilities are objective: for example, if the decision relevant
probabilities are the ones objectively mandated by my evidence, then I
will have difficulty knowing what to do, if I do not know what my
evidence is or what it supports. And it seems especially difficult to
scrutinize how my evidence bears on the long-term consequences of my
actions. This thought fits well with Greaves&rsquo;s notion of complex
cluelessness mentioned above. But a version of this problem might
arise even if the relevant probabilities are subjective, corresponding
simply to the agent&rsquo;s credences: there may be cases where these
credences are difficult to introspect to the required precision. (More
generally, the view that mental states are not &ldquo;luminous&rdquo;
[Williamson 2000] is relevant here.) At any rate, on this first
reading, the problem with cluelessness is that not only is there
uncertainty about the consequences of one&rsquo;s actions, but one is
also unable to access the decision-relevant probabilities to
sufficient precision.</p>

<p>
A different possible upshot of cluelessness is that the
decision-relevant probabilities are <em>themselves</em> imprecise or
in some sense indeterminate (Greaves 2016; Mogensen 2021). A common
way to represent this sort of uncertainty is, not by a probability
measure <i>p</i> over outcomes, but by a set <i>S</i> of such
probability measures; see the entry on
 <a href="../imprecise-probabilities/">imprecise probabilities</a>
 for further discussion. For each option, we will end up with a range
of expected values, one for each <i>p</i> in <i>S</i>, and there is
nothing more precise or determinate to be said about where the
&ldquo;true&rdquo; expected value lies within that range. So, the
thought is, cluelessness with respect to the long-term consequences of
our actions means that the probabilities of those consequences must be
somewhat indeterminate; moreover, insofar as the values of some of
those consequences are very large, the expected values of our options
will tend to be highly indeterminate as well.</p>

<p>
To see why this might be problematic, we have to ask what one ought to
do in light of all this indeterminacy or imprecision. Let us indicate
three types of views, two of which lead to a kind of cluelessness
objection. (See the entries on
 <a href="../decision-theory/">decision theory</a>
 and on
 <a href="../rationality-normative-nonutility/">rivals to expected utility theory</a>
 for further views and references.) </p>

<ol style="list-style-type: arabic">

<li> Insofar as it is indeterminate which options have higher expected
value than which others, it is indeterminate what one ought to do. If
it is indeterminate what one ought to do, then one can&rsquo;t (at
least normally) know what one ought to do, and this might seem
objectionable if it is sufficiently widespread. (In the context of
cluelessness, Greaves [2016] tentatively endorses this interpretation,
following Rinard [2015].) </li>

<li> Some views of decision-making with imprecise probabilities are
highly permissive: if option <i>x</i> has higher expected value than
option <i>y</i> with respect to even just one <i>p</i> in <i>S</i>,
then it is permissible to choose <i>x</i> over <i>y</i>. In this case,
our cluelessness about the non-proximate consequences of our actions
may lead, not to cluelessness about what we ought to do, but to an
implausibly nihilistic theory on which, in practice, everything is
permitted. (Mogensen [2021] develops this worry.)</li>

<li> On the other hand, some theories of decision-making with
imprecise probabilities, discussed in the context of &ldquo;ambiguity
aversion&rdquo; (see section 4.3 of the entry on
 <a href="../rationality-normative-nonutility/">rivals to expected utility theory</a>),
 lead to determinate verdicts about what one ought to do, while
avoiding nihilism. (Of course, cluelessness may still arise in other
ways, e.g., because the relevant probabilities or other decision
parameters cannot be precisely estimated.) </li>
</ol>

<p>
These views raise interesting questions about the role of ambiguity
attitudes in moral choice (see, e.g., Bradley 2022; Buchak 2023).</p>

<p>
A different form of &ldquo;cluelessness&rdquo; might arise from
<em>unawareness</em> of the possible consequences of our actions,
rather than from sparse or complicated evidence. See Bradley (2017)
and Steele &amp; Stef&aacute;nsson (2021) for introductions to
unawareness, and Roussos (2021&mdash;see Other Internet Resources) for
cluelessness as unawareness. The general idea is that, before we can
properly take into account any uncertainty about some possibility
<i>P</i>, we must be aware of <i>P</i>; <i>P</i> must be on our radar.
We might not be aware of a possibility because we lack the proper
conceptual repertoire. More simply, it might just be a possibility
which has never occurred to us, or even if it is something to which we
have given long hard thought in the past, we may, being bounded
agents, simply fail to bring it to mind when making a decision. All
three of these types of unawareness might be particularly pervasive
when it comes to thinking through the manifold long-term consequences
of our actions, and might leave us with no reliable method of
determining what we ought to do. Following Nozick (1974: 313&ndash;4),
it may help to imagine neolithic people trying to anticipate their
effects on twenty-first century society&mdash;it seems they would not
and arguably could not entertain the key questions. On the other hand,
as Steele &amp; Stef&aacute;nsson (2021, 2022) effectively argue,
perhaps there are awareness-relative norms (in analogy to belief- or
evidence-relative norms) that we can still try to follow in many cases
of unawareness.</p>

<p>
So far, we have written as if, in the relevant cases, one cannot get
much of an idea of what one ought to do without first doing something
along the lines of an explicit expected value calculation, eliciting
the probabilities of various outcomes with adequate precision. But
even if expected value maximization is the criterion of rightness, it
does not follow that calculating expected value is the only, the best,
or even a viable decision-procedure (Railton 1984; Jackson 1991;
Feldman 2006). The literature on heuristics (see, e.g., Gigerenzer
&amp; Gaissmaier 2011) and on &ldquo;decision-making under deep
uncertainty&rdquo; (see, e.g., Helgeson 2020; Marchau, et al. 2019)
can be interpreted as proposing methods for decision-making that are
more tractable and that bypass various kinds of cluelessness (Thorstad
&amp; Mogensen 2020; Mogensen &amp; Thorstad 2022; Steele &amp;
Stef&aacute;nsson 2021: 8.4). But, at least at a first glance, this
only changes the target of the cluelessness objection: aren&rsquo;t we
also clueless about which decision-procedures will do well in any
given case (cf. Mogensen &amp; Thorstad 2022: 3.2)? While
environmental feedback and empirical study can help identify
procedures that tend to perform well with respect to relatively
short-run and familiar sorts of consequences, it is at least unclear
how to identify procedures that would tend to perform well with
respect to very long-term consequences, about which feedback is much
harder to obtain.</p>

<p>
Things are arguably rosier if we ask, not which decision-procedure
will lead to the right act in a given situation, but which
decision-procedure it would be best to adopt <em>repeatedly</em>, to
cover a range of future decisions. Similarly, we can ask, in the
spirit of rule consequentialism, what decision-procedures it would be
best for everyone to adopt. In some cases, at least, the long-term
effects of universally and/or repeatedly applying a decision-procedure
may be easier to predict than those of applying it once-off
(Burch-Brown 2014). If so, rule consequentialism (and, more generally,
moral theories that worry about the consequences of widespread
rule-adoption, rather than the consequences of individual actions) may
be in a better position than act consequentialism when it comes to
cluelessness, although how much better is difficult to tell.</p>

<h2 id="MoraConsUndeRisk">4. Moral Constraints Under Risk</h2>

<p>
The problem of cluelessness suggests that the standard
decision-theoretic framework of expected utility maximization may be
difficult or impossible to apply in practice for any agent who gives
moral weight to long-term consequences, since these consequences can
be enormously complex and unpredictable. In contrast, when we turn our
attention to non-consequentialist moral considerations in the context
of uncertainty, a central worry is that the expected utility framework
is inapplicable <em>in principle</em>&mdash;it cannot do justice to
all the things non-consequentialists care about&mdash;while at the
same time plausible alternatives to that framework are very hard to
come by. We now turn our attention to this challenge, with a
particular focus on how non-consequentialists should evaluate actions
that carry risks of harm to others.</p>

<p>
A distinctive feature of many non-consequentialist moral theories is
<em>agent-centred constraints</em>. An agent-centred constraint is,
roughly, a moral reason against taking a particular type of action
(e.g., killing, stealing, lying) that is not matched by an equally
strong reason to <em>prevent</em> other actions of that type. Thus,
for instance, one should not kill even to prevent multiple killing, or
lie even to prevent multiple
 lies.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-16" id="ref-16">16</a>]</sup>
 Some non-consequentialists (e.g., Kant 1797 [1996]; Anscombe 1958;
Gewirth 1981, 1982; Finnis 2011: 223&ndash;226) have famously held
that some agent-centred constraints are <em>absolute</em>, i.e., ought
never be violated no matter the consequences.</p>

<p>
Just as an agent can be uncertain about the consequences of her
actions, however, she can be uncertain whether a given action would
violate an agent-centred constraint. Sometimes these uncertainties are
one and the same, since the constraint in question prohibits acts with
certain consequences. For instance, I may be unsure whether a given
action would result in someone&rsquo;s death, and therefore uncertain
whether it violates an agent-centred constraint against killing. But
there are other ways of being uncertain whether an action violates a
constraint. For instance, perhaps it is permissible to kill a wrongful
aggressor in self-defence, but impermissible to kill an
&ldquo;innocent threat&rdquo; (someone who endangers you through no
fault of their own, e.g., out of non-culpable ignorance), and you find
yourself endangered by someone without knowing whether they are a
wrongful aggressor or an innocent threat. Perhaps there is a
constraint against breaking your promises, but you can&rsquo;t
remember the details of some past promise and are therefore uncertain
whether a particular action would violate it. Perhaps there is a
constraint against acting with certain motives (e.g., to deceive) and
you are unsure of your own motives.</p>

<p>
The non-consequentialist, even the absolutist, cannot plausibly claim
that any action that carries a <em>risk</em> of violating a constraint
is impermissible. For one thing, it&rsquo;s plausible that
<em>all</em> our actions carry such a risk&mdash;for instance,
anything you do <em>might</em> cause the death of an innocent person.
But even if it&rsquo;s possible to be certain that you aren&rsquo;t
violating a constraint (e.g., by simply doing nothing at all), the
demand for such certainty is clearly excessive. It&rsquo;s permissible
to drive your friend to the airport even though this entails
<em>some</em> risk of hitting and killing an innocent pedestrian.
It&rsquo;s permissible to take mundane actions that have some non-zero
but remote probability of violating a long-forgotten promise.</p>

<p>
A natural suggestion for the constraint-theorist to make is that there
is some <em>probability threshold</em> <i>t</i> such that an action is
permissible only if its probability of violating an agent-centred
constraint is less than <i>t</i>. (Or, more plausibly, perhaps there
are different thresholds for different constraints.) For instance,
perhaps an action is permissible only if its probability of killing an
innocent person is less than 0.1%.</p>

<p>
One obvious worry is that the threshold proposal seems
arbitrary&mdash;what principled basis could we give for claiming that
the maximum acceptable risk of violating a deontological constraint
is, say, 0.1% as opposed to 0.2%, or 0.01%, or&hellip;? (This point is
made by, for instance, Portmore 2017: 293&ndash;4 and Jackson &amp;
Smith 2016: 284.) In addition, the threshold approach faces an
&ldquo;agglomeration&rdquo; problem: it is hard to extend in a
plausible way to sequences of risky choices and to choices involving
multiple risks. Jackson and Smith (2006: 276) illustrate this problem
with the following case.</p>

<dl class="partag indent">
<dt><strong>Two Skiers</strong></dt>
<dd>

<p>
Two skiers are headed down a mountain slope, along different paths.
Each, if allowed to continue, will trigger an avalanche that will kill
different groups of ten innocent people. The only way to save each
group is to shoot the corresponding skier dead with your sniper rifle.
The moral theory you accept tells you that you ought to kill culpable
aggressors in other-defence, but are absolutely prohibited from
killing innocent threats. Unfortunately, you are uncertain whether the
skiers know what they&rsquo;re doing&mdash;they may be trying to kill
their respective groups, or they may just be oblivious. Specifically,
you assign each skier the same probability <i>p</i> of acting
innocently, and the probabilities for the two skiers are
independent.</p> </dd>
</dl>

<p>
Suppose that the threshold for permissible risk of violating the
constraint against killing an innocent threat is <i>t</i>, so that,
considering each skier in isolation, it would be permissible to shoot
if and only if the probability <i>p</i> that they are acting
innocently is less than <i>t</i>. And suppose that, while <i>p</i> is
indeed less than <i>t</i>, the probability that <em>at least one
skier</em> is acting innocently \((1 - (1-p)^2 = 2p - p^2)\) is
greater than \(t\). Then, it seems, although you are
permitted&mdash;perhaps even obligated&mdash;to shoot Skier 1, and to
shoot Skier 2, you are prohibited from taking the combined action
<em>shoot Skier 1 and shoot Skier 2</em>!</p>

<p>
The deontologist might reply that we should evaluate each action in
isolation, so that you are permitted to take the combined action
because each of its component simple actions carries only an
acceptable level of moral risk. But now suppose that it is
<em>only</em> possible to kill both skiers with a single
action&mdash;for instance, you only have one bullet, but are such a
marksman that you can kill both skiers with a single shot. Then this
single action would carry a risk greater than <i>t</i> of violating an
absolute moral constraint, and so be prohibited. But it does not seem
plausible that it is permissible to shoot both skiers if you use
separate bullets, but impermissible to shoot them both with one
bullet.</p>

<p>
In reply to Jackson and Smith&rsquo;s argument, Aboodi, Borer, and
Enoch (2008) suggest that deontologists should adopt an
individualistic, patient-centred approach on which the threshold for
acceptable risk of committing a rights violation is indexed to
particular rightsholders; i.e., what matters is not that an agent runs
a total risk less than <i>t</i> of violating anyone&rsquo;s rights but
rather that, for each individual rightsholder, she runs a risk less
than <i>t</i> of violating their rights. Thus, in Two Skiers, you
ought to shoot both the skiers because even though the total risk of
wronging someone is greater than <i>t</i>, the risk of wronging either
skier individually is not. But, as both Huemer (2010) and Jackson
&amp; Smith (2016) point out, the same agglomeration problem can
reappear in cases involving multiple possible infringements on the
same rightsholder. Further, as Huemer (2010) notes, the
patient-centred approach will implausibly prefer to subject many
individuals to risks just below the probability
threshold&mdash;perhaps guaranteeing that <em>someone</em> will suffer
serious harm&mdash;rather than subject a single individual to a risk
just above the threshold.</p>

<p>
Given the difficulties of the threshold approach, we might try instead
to accommodate deontological considerations within the framework of
expected utility theory. It is commonly recognized that many
apparently non-consequentialist moral theories can be
&ldquo;consequentialized&rdquo;&mdash;that is, we can state an
extensionally equivalent moral theory in consequentialist language
(see the entry on
 <a href="../consequentializing/">consequentializing</a>).
 For instance, a theory that says it is always wrong to kill an
innocent person even to save a greater number of innocent people can
be consequentialized as a theory according to which any outcome where
the agent has killed an innocent person is worse than any outcome
where the agent has merely let innocent people die. In a similar
manner, we may be able to represent a non-consequentialist
theory&rsquo;s ranking of risky options as maximizing the expectation
of a utility function, even if the theory&rsquo;s actual explanation
or justification for that ranking makes no reference to
&ldquo;utility&rdquo; or its expectation (Colyvan, Cox, &amp; Steele
2010). (Indeed, as noted in
 <a href="#ExpeUtilTheoEthi">section 2</a>,
 expected utility theory on at least one orthodox interpretation does
not claim that an option is permissible <em>because</em> it has
maximal expected utility, but only that the facts about permissibility
are such that there is an extensionally accurate representation of
them in terms of maximizing the expectation of a utility
function.)</p>

<p>
One possibility is to represent absolute constraints by means of
lexicographic utilities. For instance, we might represent the
objective choiceworthiness of acts with two-component vectors of real
numbers, lexicographically ordered (meaning that \((x_1,y_1) \geq
(x_2,y_2)\) if and only if (i) \(x_1 &gt; x_2\) or (ii) \(x_1 = x_2\)
and \(y_1 \geq y_2\)), with the first component taking value \(-1\) if
the act violates a constraint and 0 otherwise. An agent is then
supposed to maximize expected utility (which is also a vector, found
by taking the expectation of each component separately). This
approach, however, seems implausibly fanatical, since it requires us
to to minimize the probability of constraint violations at any
 cost.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-17" id="ref-17">17</a>]</sup>
 See however Lee-Stronach (2018), who combines the lexicographic
approach with a form of small-probability neglect in order to avoid
this conclusion.</p>

<p>
Another possibility is to represent constraint theories using
ordinary, real-valued utilities. This is a natural approach for
non-absolutist theories: If, for instance, a theory says that there is
a constraint against killing an innocent person that can be overridden
only to save 1000 or more innocent people, it is natural to model the
theory as assigning a disutility to killing as is 1000 times greater
than the disutility of letting die. But perhaps surprisingly, even
absolutist theories can arguably be represented in the framework of
ordinary, non-lexicographic expected utility theory. The trick is to
assign lower-priority considerations (e.g., saving lives) diminishing
marginal utility and bounded total utility, while assigning
higher-priority considerations (e.g., not killing innocent people)
utilities whose magnitudes exceed those bounds (Lazar &amp;
Lee-Stronach 2019; Black 2020). For instance, perhaps the utility of
saving \(n\) lives is bounded above at 100, while the disutility of
killing an innocent person is \(-1000\). In this case, it is never
permissible to kill an innocent person with certainty to save any
number of lives. More generally, we might claim that differences in
the utility of acts arising from the impersonal value of their
consequences are bounded above at some finite value \(b\), and that
the disutility of violating an absolute constraint is greater than
\(b\).</p>

<p>
This view has the attractive feature of allowing small enough risks of
constraint violations to be outweighed. (For instance, in the example
above, we may run up to a 10% risk of killing an innocent person to
save a large enough number of lives.) It also lets the deontologist
represent more or less stringent constraints by larger or smaller
disutilities, so that a small probability of violating a constraint is
harder to justify if the constraint is more stringent. On the other
hand, it inherits the various drawbacks of bounded expected utility as
an approach to moral decision-making&mdash;for instance, extreme
risk-aversion near the upper bound and risk-seeking near the lower
bound (Beckstead &amp; Thomas forthcoming), and potential violations
of <em>ex ante</em> Pareto principles (Kosonen 2022: Ch. 1). We
discuss these drawbacks in
 <a href="#SmalProbExtrStak">section 6</a>
 below.</p>

<p>
Even if it can provide an extensionally plausible treatment of
agent-centred constraints, it is up for debate whether
non-consequentialists should embrace expected utility theory. Seth
Lazar, who defends an expected utility-based approach to deontological
ethics under risk, nevertheless argues that the expected utility
framework requires substantial modifications to accommodate features
of non-consequentialist morality like agent-centred options (Lazar
2017b) and the moral significance of sunk costs (Lazar 2017a). But
other philosophers (e.g., Hansson 2003; Tenenbaum 2017) are sceptical
of any expected utility-based approach. Here is one reason for such
scepticism: A basic feature of orthodox expected utility theory is
that the utility of taking a given act in a given state of nature does
not depend on the probability of that state, on what other states were
possible, or on their probabilities. But deontologists may claim that
the <em>objective</em> (as well as the subjective/prospective) moral
character of an act depends on the agent&rsquo;s beliefs and evidence
in ways that clash with this principle. For instance, suppose that
<i>A</i> takes an action that recklessly endangers <i>B</i>, but
luckily results in no harm. A deontologist might judge that this act
is not, even <em>ex post</em>, equivalent to an act that was certain
to be harmless all along. For instance, by acting with reckless
disregard for <i>B</i>&rsquo;s welfare, <i>A</i> may have violated
<i>B</i>&rsquo;s rights, or failed to treat her as an end in herself.
If so, deontologists cannot treat risky actions simply as probability
distributions over risk-free actions; more formally, they cannot
evaluate the utility of an outcome independent of its probability and
the probabilities of alternative outcomes, as expected utility theory
 requires.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-18" id="ref-18">18</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<p>
The debate we have surveyed thus far is focused on questions of
individual morality&mdash;how individuals should act when they face
risks of violating constraints. But there is also a parallel, closely
related literature on &ldquo;risk imposition&rdquo; that is primarily
focused on how governments and other social institutions should manage
and regulate
 risk.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-19" id="ref-19">19</a>]</sup>
 In this context, it is even more obvious that simple rules like an
absolute prohibition on imposing <em>any</em> risk of grave harm on an
innocent person, or a requirement to keep the probability of ever
harming an innocent person below some fixed threshold, are unworkable.
Any criminal justice system will run some risk of convicting and
imprisoning innocent people, and in any sufficiently large system, it
is all but inevitable that this risk will be realized at least once.
Similarly, in permitting a new technology that causes even the
smallest amount of pollution or carries even the smallest risk of
accidents that harm non-consenting parties, governments allow many
people to be subjected to risk, often with near-certainty that some
will suffer serious harm.</p>

<p>
But in the context of social and political institutions, a new set of
considerations also becomes salient: rather than simply considering
the <em>prospects</em> of risky actions (e.g., the amount of good that
can be achieved by a risky act, the probability that the act would
violate a constraint, and the stringency of the constraint it would
violate), it is natural to ask whether the act in question comports
with a system of general norms that is just, fair, or otherwise
legitimate. This might suggest principles like the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Exposure of a person to a risk is acceptable if and only if this
exposure is part of an equitable social system of risk-taking that
works to her advantage. (Hansson 2003: 305)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Contractualists about individual morality, for whom the correct moral
norms are those to which ideally reasonable individuals would consent
or which no individual could reasonably reject (see the entry on
 <a href="../contractualism/">contractualism</a>),
 might be inclined to take a similar approach to cases of
interpersonal (rather than institutional) risk imposition. But
contractualists face an important tension here: On the one hand,
reasonable individuals might&mdash;indeed, often do&mdash;accept small
risks of severe harm in exchange for relatively minor benefits. (For
instance, biking to the store might carry a slightly greater risk of
fatal accident than walking, but this risk may be an acceptable price
to save half an hour.) So it seems that contractualists should endorse
norms that accept this sort of tradeoff&mdash;in particular, that
permit every individual to impose very small risks of catastrophic
harm on others (e.g., by driving on residential streets) for the sake
of relatively minor benefits. On the other hand, the aggregate effect
of everyone accepting and acting on such a norm will almost certainly
be that a few people suffer catastrophic harms, while a much larger
number of people receive minor benefits. And this <em>result</em>
seems hard to justify to the few who are catastrophically harmed,
given that contractualists characteristically wish to disallow the
aggregation of many minor claims to outweigh individually much
weightier claims. This dilemma is the fault line between &ldquo;<em>ex
ante</em>&rdquo; contractualists, who focus on whether any individual
could reasonably reject a given norm <em>in advance</em> (on the basis
of the <em>prospect</em> that norm confers on them), and <em>ex
post</em> contractualists, who focus on whether any individual could
reasonably reject a given norm <em>after the fact</em> (on the basis
of the <em>outcome</em> they receive as a result of that norm). This
debate has generated a substantial literature, with influential
contributions including Ashford (2003), Lenman (2008), Fried (2012),
Frick (2015), and Kumar (2015), among others. We do not explore this
literature here, however, because it is well covered in section 11 of
the entry on
 <a href="../contractualism/">contractualism</a>.</p>
 
<p>
A final related question is whether, when we take actions that expose
another person to risk (and perhaps also actions that confer uncertain
benefits), we should take account of that person&rsquo;s particular
attitudes and preferences with respect to risk. For instance, suppose
that a government with a limited budget can focus either on reducing
air pollution (which will have a fairly uniform effect on
everyone&rsquo;s health, increasing average lifespan by 6 months) or
on reducing fatal traffic accidents (which will reduce the probability
of a rare but individually catastrophic outcome, increasing average
lifespan by 3 months). From a self-interested standpoint, different
members of the public might have different preferences between these
interventions: a risk-neutral individual will prefer the former, but a
sufficiently risk-averse individual might prefer the latter. How much
weight, if any, should the government give to these individual
preferences when deciding between the two projects? Similar questions
arise where one individual must make risky choices on behalf of
another, e.g., as a medical proxy. (Consequentialists confront these
questions as well, but they seem more difficult for
non-consequentialists, for whom weighing harms and benefits to others
is not simply a matter of maximizing the impartial good but is
influenced by ideals like respect and autonomy.)</p>

<p>
This question has only recently begun to receive substantial
attention. On the side of deference to individual risk preferences,
Buchak (2017) has argued that, when making decisions that affect an
individual with known risk attitudes, the potential effects on that
individual should be evaluated according to their own risk attitude.
Thus, for instance, if the population is sufficiently risk-averse, the
government in the preceding example might be required to focus on
reducing traffic accidents even if reducing air pollution would almost
certainly yield greater total benefit. On the other hand, Bovens
(2015) has argued that it is reasonable for an agent making decisions
on behalf of another to be <em>more</em> risk-averse than the patient
herself. For a survey of this debate, see Thoma (2023).</p>

<h2 id="MoraUnce">5. Moral Uncertainty</h2>

<p>
So far we have considered some of the distinctive problems facing
consequentialists and non-consequentialists respectively in dealing
with uncertainty. But what if you are uncertain whether
consequentialism or non-consequentialism is true? More generally, what
if you&rsquo;re uncertain about any basic question of morality, and
face a choice where different moral principles recommend different
actions? How should you decide what to do in light of that
uncertainty? This is often referred to as the problem of
<em>decision-making under moral uncertainty</em>, where &ldquo;moral
uncertainty&rdquo; means uncertainty about fundamental moral
principles (as opposed to uncertainty about morally relevant empirical
facts).</p>

<p>
Aspects of this question were discussed by moral theologians in the
seventeenth century, in a debate that pitted morally cautious
Jansenists (who held that you ought to avoid actions that have even a
small probability of being morally wrong) against more permissive
Jesuits (who held that, for instance, one may take an action if the
principle that permits it is at least a probable as the principle that
forbids it). For a summary of these debates, see Sepielli (2010:
48&ndash;53). Toward the end of the twentieth century, these questions
began to reemerge (e.g., in Hudson 1989; Gracely 1996), with a
particular interest in the ethics of abortion (Greenwell 1977;
Pfeiffer 1985). But since the publication of Ted Lockhart&rsquo;s
<em>Moral Uncertainty and Its Consequences</em> (2000), the problem of
decision-making under moral uncertainty has received much more
sustained and general attention.</p>

<p>
One prominent view in this debate holds that there is no problem,
because one&rsquo;s beliefs and uncertainties about basic moral
principles have no bearing on what one ought to do, in any interesting
sense of <em>ought</em>. Following Weatherson, we will call this view
<em>externalism</em>, since it claims that what an agent ought to do
is determined by moral truths external to (or at any rate, independent
of) her mental states, rather than internal features of the agent like
her beliefs or evidence concerning moral principles. Versions of this
view are defended by Weatherson (2014, 2019), Harman (2015), and
Hedden (2016), among others. Weatherson argues that acting in a way
that is sensitive to one&rsquo;s beliefs about basic moral principles
requires &ldquo;<em>de dicto</em>&rdquo; moral motivation (motivation
<em>to do the right thing, whatever that turns out to be</em>), and
that <em>de dicto</em> moral motivation manifests an objectionably
&ldquo;fetishistic&rdquo; concern for rightness as such, as opposed to
the things in the world that actually matter morally. Harman argues
that, if what one subjectively ought to do depended on one&rsquo;s
moral beliefs, then ignorance of basic moral principles would be
exculpatory, which (she claims) it isn&rsquo;t. (For replies to
Weatherson and Harman respectively, see Sepielli 2016, 2018a.) Hedden
argues that decision rules that are sensitive to an agent&rsquo;s
moral beliefs would have to overcome the &ldquo;problem of
intertheoretic value comparisons&rdquo; (discussed below), and that
this problem is insuperable. All these philosophers then conclude,
with minor variations, that what an agent ought to do (in the
relevant, subjective sense of &ldquo;ought&rdquo;) depends on the
<em>true</em> moral principles as well as the agent&rsquo;s
beliefs/evidence about non-moral matters, but not on her
beliefs/evidence concerning moral principles.</p>

<p>
Many participants in the debate, however, have found this view
implausible. We don&rsquo;t know, and cannot easily find out, what the
true moral principles are, and yet we must decide what to do
<em>somehow</em>, with only our uncertain beliefs to guide us. And it
certainly seems like there&rsquo;s <em>something</em> significant to
be said for an agent who does what she believes to be right instead of
what she believes to be wrong, independent of whether her beliefs are
in fact correct&mdash;for instance, that she is <em>morally
conscientious</em> or is responding <em>rationally</em> to her beliefs
(MacAskill, Bykvist, &amp; Ord 2020: Ch. 1; Bykvist 2020). Moreover,
Podgorski (2020) gives a clever argument that, in cases where an
agent&rsquo;s moral and empirical beliefs are not probabilistically
independent, views that ignore an agent&rsquo;s moral beliefs will
sometimes recommend dominated acts (acts that are certain to be
morally worse than some available alternative).</p>

<p>
If what an agent ought to do does depend on her moral beliefs, then we
face the question of how agents should act when they are morally
uncertain. One simple proposal, which Lockhart (2000) dubs &ldquo;My
Favorite Theory&rdquo; (MFT), is that she should simply follow the
moral theory in which she has greatest credence, disregarding all
other moral theories. This view has been defended by Gracely (1996)
and Gustafsson and Torpman (2014). But it faces substantial
difficulties. First, it simply seems intuitively implausible to ignore
all moral possibilities except one. For instance, suppose you have 49%
credence that members of some animal species \(S\) have moral
standing, and can take some action that would very slightly benefit a
human being while imposing massive harm on members of \(S\). Even if
the most probable theory says that you ought to take this action, it
seems reckless to disregard the substantial probability that it would
be deeply morally wrong. Second, the implications of MFT are sensitive
to how we individuate moral theories, i.e., how we decide whether to
treat two moral views as versions of the same theory or as different
theories. The most natural approach, adopted by Gustafsson and
Torpman, is to individuate theories finely, treating \(T_1\) and
\(T_2\) as versions of the same theory only if it is impossible for
them ever to disagree about what one ought to do. But then you may
well find that you have credence in a vast number of moral theories
(for instance, many different prioritarian theories with slightly
different priority weighting functions), and that your
&ldquo;favorite&rdquo; theory commands only a tiny portion of your
credence (say, less than 1%). The implication that your actions might
be guided exclusively by such a tiny portion of your credence
distribution seems implausible. Finally, Gustafsson himself recants
MFT (in Gustafsson 2022) because of its problems with sequential
choice situations: It can recommend sequences of actions that are
worse in expectation than an available alternative according to
<em>every</em> moral theory in which the agent has positive
credence.</p>

<p>
An alternative approach, dubbed &ldquo;My Favorite Option&rdquo; (MFO)
by Gustafsson and Torpman (2014), holds that a morally uncertain agent
should choose the <em>option</em> that has the greatest probability of
being morally right or permissible, taking the assessments of all
moral theories in which she has positive credence into account. But
this view faces difficulties closely analogous to MFT&rsquo;s. First,
it will similarly recommend actions that are probably just slightly
better than their alternatives, but have a substantial probability of
being catastrophically morally worse. Second, just as MFT is sensitive
to how we individuate <em>theories</em>, MFO is sensitive to how we
individuate <em>options</em>. And third, MFO can generate cyclic
pairwise comparisons of options (e.g., telling you to choose \(O_1\)
over \(O_2\), \(O_2\) over \(O_3\), and \(O_3\) over \(O_1\)), which
can lead agents to make sequences of choices that are certainly worse
than available alternatives&mdash;an even worse form of sequential
failure than that resulting from MFT (Gustafsson &amp; Torpman 2014:
165&ndash;6).</p>

<p>
Both MFT and MFO are sensitive only to whether a given action is
morally right or permissible according to a given moral theory. They
take no account of the relative size of <em>differences</em> in moral
value or choiceworthiness between alternative actions. But, as in the
&ldquo;species \(S\)&rdquo; example above, it is intuitive that these
cardinal facts make a difference to how we ought to act under moral
uncertainty: It is better, for instance, to do something that has a
51% probability of being just <em>slightly</em> wrong than to do
something that has a 49% probability of being a moral atrocity. The
idea that we should care about the magnitude as well as the
probability of potential moral considerations under moral uncertainty
is sometimes referred to as &ldquo;moral hedging&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
A natural suggestion, if one finds moral hedging plausible, is that we
should use expectational decision principles to respond to moral as
well as empirical uncertainty. That is, an agent making decisions
under moral uncertainty should aim to maximize <em>expected moral
value</em>, <em>expected rightness</em>, or <em>expected
choiceworthiness</em>, with respect to her distribution of credence
over rival moral theories as well as empirical hypotheses. Versions of
this view have been defended by Lockhart (2000); Ross (2006); Sepielli
(2009); MacAskill &amp; Ord (2020); and MacAskill, Bykvist, &amp; Ord
(2020); among others. Though these authors use different
terminologies, we will follow the most common terminology in the
recent literature and refer to these views collectively as
<em>maximize expected choiceworthiness</em> (MEC).</p>

<p>
Any expectational approach to moral uncertainty faces a major
challenge: To take an expectation over different moral theories, we
must be able to <em>compare</em> the magnitude of differences in
choiceworthiness according to rival theories. For instance, suppose
you face a trolley problem where you can save five innocent people by
killing one, and that you split your credence evenly between classical
utilitarianism and a deontological theory that absolutely prohibits
killing innocent people. Which option maximizes expected
choiceworthiness in this situation depends on whether <em>the
unchoiceworthiness of four (net) deaths, according to classical
utilitarianism</em> is greater or less than <em>the unchoiceworthiness
of violating the constraint against killing, according to
deontology</em>. But does this sort of cross-theory comparison even
make sense? What could make it the case that one of these quantities
is greater than the other, particularly given that at least one of the
theories in question has to be false? And even if there are facts
about intertheoretic choiceworthiness comparisons, how could we
possibly know them? These difficulties comprise the <em>problem of
intertheoretic comparisons</em>, one of the central problems in the
literature on decision-making under moral uncertainty.</p>

<p>
Some (e.g., Gracely 1996; Hedden 2016) have held that this problem is
insuperable, and that we therefore must adopt some view like
externalism or My Favorite Theory that does not require intertheoretic
comparisons. But others have tried to rescue expectational approaches
to moral uncertainty from the problem of intertheoretic comparisons.
One strategy, sometimes called the &ldquo;common ground&rdquo;
approach (MacAskill et al. 2020: 133ff), tries to find points of
agreement between rival moral theories that can serve as a basis for
intertheoretic comparisons. For instance, suppose you are uncertain
between total utilitarianism, which tells you to maximize total
welfare, and a pluralistic theory that tells you to maximize a
weighted sum of welfare and beauty. Another way of describing this
situation is that you are certain that you should maximize total
value, and certain that welfare has value, but uncertain whether
beauty also has value. At least on some ways of filling in the details
of your belief state, it is natural to claim that you should treat the
value of a unit of welfare as independent of the question of whether
beauty has value&mdash;that is, a unit of welfare has the same value
regardless of whether utilitarianism or pluralism is true. If so, then
we have a way of making comparisons between these two theories: they
value a unit of welfare equally, and agree about the magnitude of
choiceworthiness differences in all choice situations where only
welfare (and not beauty) is at stake. Approaches of broadly this sort
are suggested by Sepielli (2009) and Tarsney (2018). The most obvious
drawback of this approach is that its scope appears quite
limited&mdash;it may let us make comparisons between pairs of total
consequentialist theories with overlapping values, but does not offer
any obvious suggestions for making intertheoretic comparisons between,
say, utilitarian and Kantian moral theories.</p>

<p>
Another strategy, the &ldquo;universal scale&rdquo; approach, starts
from the idea that there is a single cardinal scale of degrees of
moral choiceworthiness. Any moral theory must, on this view, be in the
business of mapping possible actions to degrees of choiceworthiness on
this scale. And in a given choice situation, uncertainty between rival
moral theories can be reconstrued as uncertainty about the value of
each available option on this scale. Approaches in this spirit are
suggested by MacAskill, Bykvist, &amp; Ord (2020) and Carr (2020).</p>

<p>
One objection to the universal scale approach is that it&rsquo;s not
at all obvious whether rival theories do in fact make use of the same
scale. For instance, in the spirit of orthodox expected utility
theory, one might claim that cardinal choiceworthiness is just a
convenient way of representing a moral theory&rsquo;s ranking of risky
prospects, not a genuine quantitative property that theories attribute
to options. In a similar spirit, does it really make sense to treat
two moral theories as rivals if they differ in their choiceworthiness
mappings while still agreeing about the ranking of all possible
actions and outcomes? And even if it does, how could we ever get
evidence for one theory over the other, or have any basis for a
particular distribution of credence between them?</p>

<p>
A third strategy, the <em>statistical normalization</em> approach,
starts from the idea that under moral uncertainty, each moral theory
should be given &ldquo;equal say&rdquo; in an agent&rsquo;s
decisions&mdash;or rather, a say proportional to its probability.
Different ways of measuring the &ldquo;say&rdquo; or influence of a
moral theory lead to different precisifications of this principle. For
instance, Lockhart argues that, in any given choice situation, the
<em>range</em> of each theory&rsquo;s choiceworthiness assignment (the
difference in choiceworthiness between the best and worst available
options) should be treated as equal (Lockhart 2000: 84). But this
principle has serious drawbacks. For instance, because it considers
each choice situation in isolation, it will evaluate tradeoffs between
the same pair of theories differently in different choice situations,
potentially leading to sequences of choices that are worse than
available alternatives according to every moral theory in which the
agent has positive credence (Sepielli 2013: 586&ndash;7). If we try to
avoid this problem by equalizing the range of each theory&rsquo;s
choiceworthiness assignment across all <em>possible</em> options, then
the view can&rsquo;t accommodate theories like classical
utilitarianism whose choiceworthiness scales are unbounded (Sepielli
2013: 588).</p>

<p>
Cotton-Barratt, MacAskill, &amp; Ord (2020) propose that we equalize
the <em>variance</em> of each moral theory&rsquo;s choiceworthiness
assignment over the set of all possible options, instead of the range.
This approach can accommodate at least some unbounded theories, and
has attractive formal properties that plausibly reflect the principle
of giving each theory weight proportionate to its probability
(Cotton-Barratt et al. 2020: 80&ndash;86). But it also has drawbacks.
For instance, because there are infinitely many possible options, the
variance of a theory&rsquo;s value assignment over all possible
options can be well-defined only if we impose a <em>measure</em> on
the set of possible options, and it&rsquo;s not obvious that there is
any principled, non-arbitrary basis for choosing such a measure.</p>

<p>
A further challenge for expectational approaches to moral uncertainty,
in addition to the problem of intertheoretic comparisons, is the
<em>structural diversity</em> of moral theories (Tarsney 2021). To
even reach the point at which we confront the problem of
intertheoretic comparisons, we must assume that each moral theory
represents the choiceworthiness of options on a one-dimensional
cardinal scale. But many moral theories don&rsquo;t seem to do this.
For instance, Kantianism evaluates actions by classifying them as
satisfying or violating the Categorical Imperative; it does not say
things like </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
murdering an innocent person is ten times as wrong as lying, which is
three times as wrong as going a year without acting on your imperfect
duty of beneficence. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Commonsense morality seems to recognize gradations of moral
choiceworthiness (e.g., a supererogatory act can be better than a
merely permissible act; one wrong act can be worse than another), but
does not commonly issue judgements about the relative magnitudes of
these differences. And many moral philosophers believe that some
values are incomparable or only imperfectly comparable, which cannot
be represented by a simple interval scale of choiceworthiness. The
aspect of this problem that has received most attention to date is the
problem of <em>merely ordinal</em> moral theories, which rank options
without assigning cardinal degrees of choiceworthiness. In this
context there is a natural analogy with voting theory: Just as voting
methods (like first-past-the-post, approval voting, or instant runoff)
aim to aggregate ordinal information about the individual preferences
of voters into a social choice, analogues of these rules can be used
to aggregate ordinal information about the preferences of moral
theories into an overall verdict about what to do under moral
uncertainty. For proposals along these lines, see Nissan-Rozen (2012),
MacAskill (2016), and Tarsney (2019).</p>

<p>
There is a final notable difficulty facing any attempt to incorporate
moral uncertainty into our decision-making: Just as we are uncertain
which moral theory is correct, we may also be uncertain <em>which
approach to decision-making under moral uncertainty</em> is correct
(e.g., we may be uncertain between MFT, MFO, and various combinations
of MEC with particular methods of intertheoretic comparison). If we
must take our uncertainty about &ldquo;first-order&rdquo; moral
theories into account, shouldn&rsquo;t we also take account of this
&ldquo;second-order&rdquo; uncertainty&mdash;and of our
&ldquo;third-order&rdquo; uncertainty about how to respond to
second-order uncertainty, and so on <em>ad infinitum</em>? Weatherson
(2014, 2019) suggests that this regress problem is fatal for the whole
project of finding rational principles for responding to normative
uncertainty. But others have tried to find solutions. Sepielli (2014)
argues that, even if we can never take <em>all</em> our uncertainties
into account when making decisions, it may still be <em>better</em>
(e.g., more rational) to account for more of our uncertainties,
including higher-order normative uncertainties. And Trammell (2021)
shows that, under some moderately strong assumptions, the various
metanormative theories in which an agent has credence will converge in
their ranking of options as we ascend the hierarchy of higher-order
norms, so that at a certain point the agent can be certain of which
option is best even if she is still uncertain between competing norms.
If the assumptions of these convergence results are often satisfied,
or if agents are rationally required to satisfy them, then the regress
may be less problematic than it first appears.</p>

<h2 id="SmalProbExtrStak">6. Small Probabilities and Extreme Stakes</h2>

<p>
A final question that looms large in the context of moral
decision-making under uncertainty is how to handle small probabilities
of extremely good or bad outcomes&mdash;or, more generally, small
probabilities that an action has some extremely morally weighty
feature. This is an important question for non-moral decision-making
as well. To give two famous examples, Pascal&rsquo;s Wager and the St.
Petersburg game are both cases of prudential decision-making under
uncertainty where small probabilities of extreme outcomes can carry
counterintuitive weight, and much ink has been spilled trying to avoid
these counterintuitive implications (see the entries on
 <a href="../pascal-wager/">Pascal&rsquo;s wager</a>
 and the
 <a href="../paradox-stpetersburg/">St. Petersburg paradox</a>).</p>
 
<p>
But the question of how to handle these extreme risks is even more
pressing in the moral context. Each of the last three sections
illustrates one reason why this is the case. Insofar as morality
requires us to take account of the interests of remote strangers, it
both raises the stakes relative to prudential decision-making and
makes prediction more difficult, so that small probabilities of
extreme outcomes (like causing or preventing the birth of the next
Hitler) are the norm rather than the exception. Insofar as morality
imposes absolute or near-absolute constraints, small probabilities of
violating those constraints can carry enormous weight. And insofar as
we must take account of fundamental moral uncertainty, small credences
in moral theories that assign extreme moral importance to a particular
choice can hijack our deliberations (Ross 2006; Beckstead &amp; Thomas
forthcoming).</p>

<p>
Should we allow small probabilities to carry such great weight in our
decisions? In other words, should we accept the following
thesis/theses?</p>

<dl class="partag indent">
<dt><em>Fanaticism</em></dt>
<dd> For any finite degree of choiceworthiness (or value, rightness,
etc.) \(d\) and any probability \(p\), there is a finite degree of
choiceworthiness \(d^+\) such that an action that has choiceworthiness
\(d^+\) with probability \(p\) and is morally neutral with probability
\((1-p)\) is preferable to an action that has choiceworthiness \(d\)
for sure; and there is a finite degree of choiceworthiness \(d^-\)
such that an action that has choiceworthiness \(d\) for sure is
preferable to an action that has choiceworthiness \(d^-\) with
probability \(p\) and is morally neutral with probability
\((1-p)\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
If moral value is unbounded, then expected value maximization is
fanatical. For instance, an agent who maximizes expected total welfare
will give potentially unlimited weight to arbitrarily low-probability
outcomes, since there is no upper or lower limit to the number of
welfare subjects in the world or, therefore, to total welfare. But
expected value maximization is not the only way of being fanatical.
For instance, a <em>risk-weighted</em> expected utility maximizer
(Buchak 2013) will exhibit fanaticism as long as her utility function
is unbounded (both above and below) and her risk function is strictly
increasing.</p>

<p>
Many people find fanaticism deeply counterintuitive, in the moral as
well as the prudential domains. There are two standard strategies for
avoiding it. One is to simply <em>ignore</em> sufficiently small
probabilities. This idea has a long history (for a useful survey, see
Monton 2019), and has recently been revived and defended by Nicholas
J. J. Smith (2014, 2016) and Monton (2019). But this idea faces many
compelling objections. To begin with, the idea of treating non-zero
probabilities like zero probabilities seems <em>ad hoc</em>, and the
choice of any particular threshold seems objectionably arbitrary. The
most straightforward versions of small-probability discounting, which
instruct an agent to simply ignore states or outcomes with
probabilities below a certain threshold, are implausibly sensitive to
how states and outcomes are individuated (Beckstead &amp; Thomas
forthcoming), and can violate dominance principles (Isaacs 2014). And
even more sophisticated formulations like
&ldquo;tail-discounting&rdquo; (Beckstead &amp; Thomas forthcoming)
are vulnerable to money pumps (Kosonen 2022: 196&ndash;235). Finally,
in the long run, small probabilities can add up, and a policy of
ignoring them can have the cumulative result of accepting very large
probabilities of extreme losses or foregoing very large probabilities
of extreme gains (Lundgren &amp; Stef&aacute;nsson 2020; Thoma
2022).</p>

<p>
The other standard strategy for avoiding fanaticism is to require a
<em>bounded</em> utility function (in the context of expected utility
theory or something similar). This view is natural and popular in the
context of individual prudential decision-making, where most goods
have diminishing marginal utility. For instance, if you could have $1
million for sure, or a \(10^{-100}\) chance of receiving a blank check
good for <em>any</em> finite amount of money, it would be quite
reasonable to choose the former option. If you are an expected utility
maximizer, then this choice implies that the utility you assign to
money is bounded.</p>

<p>
But in the moral context, the bounded utility approach looks less
promising. Intuitively, while providing more of the same material
benefit to a single person has diminishing marginal value, providing a
given benefit to more people does not. (Does saving <i>C</i>&rsquo;s
life count for less because you have already saved <i>A</i>&rsquo;s
and <i>B</i>&rsquo;s?) So the use of a bounded utility function cannot
easily be motivated by the thought that value or choiceworthiness is
itself bounded. Also, boundedness in the moral context can have deeply
counterintuitive consequences, requiring extreme risk aversion near
the upper bound of your utility function and extreme risk-seeking near
the lower bound. For instance, if the utility of saving lives is
bounded, there will be some \(n\) such that saving \(n\) lives with
probability \(p\) has greater expected utility than saving <em>any
finite number of lives</em> with probability \(0.99p\) (Beckstead
&amp; Thomas forthcoming).</p>

<p>
The idea that the moral value of benefits to one person does not
depend on how many others have been benefited in fact hints at a
powerful class of arguments for fanaticism in the moral context. Any
view that assigns decreasing (or increasing) marginal utility to
benefiting additional people will violate compelling principles to the
effect that if one prospect is more desirable than another from the
standpoint of some individuals or subpopulations considered in
isolation, and equivalent from the standpoint of all other
individuals/subpopulations, then it is more desirable overall.
Arguments of this sort, focusing on &ldquo;separability&rdquo;
principles for non-overlapping subpopulations, are discussed by
Wilkinson (2022), Beckstead &amp; Thomas (forthcoming), and Russell
(forthcoming). But a particularly simple version of the argument can
be stated using individuals rather than subpopulations. (What follows
is a variation on Kowalczyk (forthcoming).) Consider a choice between
the two prospects described in
 <a href="#table1">Tables 1 &amp; 2</a>.
 Here you have the opportunity to benefit some very large number of
individuals \(n\). The choice is between certainty of benefiting one
of them at random, and a \(\frac{1}{n}\) chance of benefiting
<em>all</em> of them. In the latter case, additionally, the benefit to
each individual will be greater. From the perspective of each
individual, therefore, the second option looks better, so there is a
compelling case for choosing it. But in so doing, you are foregoing a
sure moral good (benefiting one individual) for a
potentially-minuscule probability (\(\frac{1}{n}\), for arbitrarily
large \(n\)) of an astronomically large good (a greater benefit to
\(n\) people).</p>

<p>
This case illustrates a simple argument for a form of fanaticism: for
any <em>improvement</em> to the world (like increasing one
person&rsquo;s welfare from 0 to 1) and any probability \(p\), we can
find a situation in which certainty of that improvement is less
desirable than probability \(p\) of some even greater improvement. The
argument needs only three premises: a weak form of <em>ex ante</em>
Pareto (to establish that the option in Table 2 is better than the
option in Table 1), the claim that randomizing the beneficiary of an
improvement (as in Table 1) doesn&rsquo;t change its value, and
transitivity. But the form of fanaticism thereby established is
somewhat weak, and is compatible with moral views that don&rsquo;t
seem intuitively &ldquo;fanatical&rdquo;: for instance, a view that
tells us to maximize expected average welfare in a population, with
individual welfare being bounded above and below. (This is a form of
bounded expected utility maximization, and so not fanatical in the
strong sense defined above.) To turn the preceding argument into an
argument for that stronger thesis, we need additional
premises&mdash;for example, one could add the premise that for any
outcomes \(O_1 \succ O_2\), we can construct an outcome at least as
good as \(O_1\) by adding good lives to \(O_2\), and an outcome at
least as bad as \(O_2\) by adding bad lives to \(O_1\).</p>

<p>
On the other hand, there are also compelling axiomatic arguments
<em>against</em> fanaticism. In particular, if fanaticism is true
then, given very minimal auxiliary assumptions, we can construct
&ldquo;improper prospects&rdquo; that we must prefer to all of their
possible outcomes (Russell &amp; Isaacs 2021; Beckstead &amp; Thomas
forthcoming; Russell
 forthcoming).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-20" id="ref-20">20</a>]</sup>
 Improper prospects have a number of counterintuitive consequences. In
particular, an agent who regards some prospect as better (or worse)
than all its possible outcomes thereby violates infinitary versions of
the principles that characterize expected utility maximization (the
independence axiom and the sure-thing principle), and thereby exhibits
many of the foibles of non-expected utility maximizers. For instance,
she will sometimes make sequences of choices that are certainly worse
than available alternatives, and will pay to avoid information
(Russell &amp; Isaacs 2021; see also the closely related argument for
boundedness in Hammond (1998)). Insofar as you think that agents
should <em>not</em> behave in those ways (a standard justification for
expected utility theory), this is a compelling argument against
fanaticism.</p>

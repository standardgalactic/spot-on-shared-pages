<h2><a name="1">1. Kinds of Change</a></h2>

<p>
The classical and medieval authors who developed DDI divided
attributes into essential and accidental. Essential attributes are
roughly those that help define the kind of thing an item is. A thing
cannot exist without having its essence. So the only way to gain an
essential attribute is to begin to exist, and the only way to lose one
is to cease to exist. Classical/medieval authors call beginning to
exist generation, not change. They call ceasing to exist corruption,
not change. They restrict the term &ldquo;change&rdquo; to gain or loss of an
accident, a non-essential attribute. Their DDS asserted that God
cannot change. So it does not entail that God cannot begin or cease to
exist. It asserts only that He cannot gain or lose an accident. </p>

<p>
Accidental attributes can be had intrinsically or extrinsically. I
explain these notions as follows: an item <em>x</em> has a property
<em>F</em> intrinsically just if whether <em>x</em> is <em>F</em> is
settled entirely by <em>x</em>, <em>x</em>&rsquo;s proper parts (if
any), plus the standard for being <em>F</em>, and has <em>F</em>
extrinsically just if it does not have F intrinsically. A change is
intrinsic just if it is a gaining or losing of a property had
intrinsically. Changes which are not intrinsic are extrinsic. An
attribute is intrinsic just if it can only be had intrinsically,
extrinsic just if it can only be had extrinsically. For any <em>x</em>
and <em>y</em>, if <em>y</em> is not part of <em>x</em>,
<em>x</em>&rsquo;s relations to y are extrinsic attributes, and so
changes in these are extrinsic. Francescotti (2017) provides many
other ways to parse &ldquo;intrinsic.&rdquo; Their differences from the one
sketched here would not affect my account; those who prefer one of
them can just reinterpret my tokens of &ldquo;intrinsic&rdquo; accordingly.</p>

<p>
Relational properties are properties like being kicked by a horse or
loved by Smith. They are clearly extrinsic. Authors from Aristotle to
Duns Scotus took some relational properties as real, inhering
accidents. Being shorter than Smith would qualify, but being admired
by Smith would not, for reasons that need not detain us. Thus DDI
ruled out not only intrinsic accidental change, but some sorts of
extrinsic change- namely, change in real, inhering relational
accident. </p>

<p>
This raises a question: why do only these kinds of changes matter?
DDI&rsquo;s friends simply followed specific arguments, discussed
below, where they seemed to lead- and they seemed to lead to denial of
these sorts of divine change. </p>

<h2><a name="2">2. Immutability vs. Impassibility</a></h2>

<p>
DDI is sometimes conflated with the doctrine of divine
<em>impassibility</em>, which asserts that nothing external can affect
God &mdash; i.e., cause God to be in any state, and in particular to
feel negative emotions like grief. Actually, DDI neither implies nor
follows from divine impassibility. Something could be impassible but
mutable if it could change itself, but nothing else could affect it.
God could also be immutable but passible. If an event outside Him
always affected God, He would always perceive it, but never change. If
it caused Him grief, He would always feel it, but never change. If
temporal, such a God would grieve for us before, as, and after we
suffer. </p>

<p>
There is nothing counter-intuitive in this. The God of Western theism
has full foreknowledge of our futures: he sees our pain before we feel
it. Were there anything about it He did not know beforehand, the
foreknowledge would not be full. Full knowledge beforehand should
elicit the same reaction as full knowledge during. So the God of
Western theism would grieve our pain beforehand if He ever grieves it
at all, and His grief before we suffer would not differ from His grief
while we suffer. It is also standard Western theism that God is
cognitively perfect. If he is, and exists in time, He has a past to
recall, and so has perfect memory. If God perfectly remembers our
pain, it is as fresh for him years later as it was while it occurred,
and if he perfectly loves us, perhaps he never gets over it. So we can
make sense of unchanging grief; if God does grieve, we might well
expect it from a God with full foreknowledge, cognitive perfection and
a perfect affective nature. If He were timeless, an immutable but
passible God would timelessly suffer for us &mdash; responsively,
i.e., because of our pain. Things would be just as if He were
temporal, save that His knowledge would not be temporally located, and
so He would not literally foreknow or remember. So whether God is
temporal or timeless, DDI implies nothing odd here. And it need not
&ldquo;depersonalize&rdquo; God, as some feel impassibility would.</p>

<p>
Still, it is surprising that Western theists have held DDI. For
Western Scriptures seem to conflict with DDI. <em>Genesis</em> depicts
human sin as saddening God, then bringing Him to new decisions, e.g.,
to flood the world. According to <em>John</em>, &ldquo;the Word became
flesh&rdquo; (1:14), i.e., God took on a human nature he did not
always have. So Western theism&rsquo;s Scriptural roots seem to deny
DDI. Yet DDI entered Judaism as early as Philo, and Christianity
during its second century. In such &ldquo;classical theist&rdquo;
writers as Augustine and Aquinas, being immutable makes God
atemporally eternal (see, e.g., Aquinas, ST Ia 9&ndash;10), and
eternality is God&rsquo;s distinctive mode of being. So DDI is at the
roots of such writers&rsquo; understandings of God&rsquo;s nature. And
though Scotus and Ockham led a revolt against divine atemporality,
they and their followers maintained DDI, and it ruled the theological
roost till the 19<sup>th</sup> century. So one wonders: what made DDI
so attractive for so long?</p>

<h2><a name="3">3. The Case for Immutability</a></h2>

<p>
For one thing, Scripture is not really so clearly on the side of
divine accidental change. Much that Scripture says of God is clearly
metaphor, and Old Testament texts which ascribe change to God could be
speaking metaphorically. As I note later, one can parse even the
Incarnation without accidental change. Standard Western theism clearly
excludes many sorts of change in God. For standard Western theists,
God is by nature a spirit, without body. If he is, God cannot change
physically &mdash; he is physically immutable. So the Western God
could at most change mentally- in knowledge, will, or affect. Further,
Scripture amply supports the claim that God is always perfect in
knowledge, will, and affect. This rules out many sorts of mental
change. This is too broad a topic to tackle fully here; instead, let
us just examine one facet of God&rsquo;s knowledge.</p>

<p>
If always perfect in knowledge, God always knows all that is past and
present, and all of the future that can be foreknown. Only free
beings&rsquo; future actions and what depends on these are even
<em>prima facie</em> beyond God&rsquo;s foreknowledge, and Scripture
is full of claims that God foreknows free actions. If God&rsquo;s
knowledge is always perfect and this always includes complete
foreknowledge, God always knows all &ldquo;tenseless&rdquo; facts. Suppose that
God now knows that I will finish this article tomorrow, and tomorrow
God knows that I <em>am</em> finishing the article. There is a fact
God knows both days, that on a day referred to one day as
&ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo; and another as &ldquo;today,&rdquo; I finish
the article. Such facts involve no real tense. It&rsquo;s the same
fact whether one is before that day, on that day, or after that day.
So such facts are tenseless. If God always foreknows even free
creaturely acts, he always knows all tenseless facts. If He always
knows them, that He knows them never changes.</p>

<p>
It is a small step from divine perfection to necessary divine
perfection. For it is surely more perfect to be unable not to be
perfect than to be perfect but able not to be. Again, it is a small
step from omniscience to necessary omniscience: the latter would be
more perfect. If God&rsquo;s knowledge is necessarily perfect, His
knowledge of tenseless fact is immutable. In any possible world in
which He knows a tenseless fact, He always knows it,. So it is not
possible that His knowledge of it change, though if there are possible
worlds in which it is not a fact, there are possible worlds in which
He never knows it. Similarly, if God is necessarily omniscient, He
immutably knows all necessary truths.</p>

<p>
So God&rsquo;s knowledge of necessary and of tenseless contingent
truth looks to be unchangeable, given only small steps beyond
Scripture. The only sort of knowledge we&rsquo;ve left out so far is
knowledge of tensed contingent truths &mdash; such truths as that
tomorrow I <em>will</em> finish the article or yesterday I
<em>did</em> finish the article. If God always knows the tenseless
correlates of these truths &mdash; e.g., that on March 27, 2002, it is
the case that I tenselessly-finish the article on March 28, 2002
&mdash; then the sheer passage of time accounts for all changes in His
contingent knowledge. For which tensed truth God knows &mdash; that I
will finish, am finishing or did finish &mdash; depends simply on what
time it is. So to speak, he never has to learn about whether I finish
on March 28; he merely has to learn where in time he is in relation to
March 28, and this tells him what tensed propositions are true about
my finishing. Thus one can make a case on what are basically
Scriptural grounds that the content of God&rsquo;s knowledge changes
at most due to the bare passage of time.</p>

<p>
So Scriptural considerations suggest a God unchangeable in some
respects. But the roots of the full DDI are also philosophical.
Western philosophers have largely filled out the concept of God by
ascribing to him the properties they thought he must have to count as
absolutely perfect. God&rsquo;s perfection seems to rule out some
sorts of change, as we&rsquo;ve just seen. More general arguments from
perfection convinced many that God cannot change in any way.</p>

<p>
In Republic II (381b-c), Plato argued for the full DDI. He asserted
that a god is &ldquo;the&hellip; best possible&rdquo; in virtue and
beauty. Virtue is a perfection of mind. Beauty can be mental or
non-mental. So Plato&rsquo;s examples are probably meant to do duty
for all mental and non-mental perfections, i.e., all perfections
<em>simpliciter</em>. If a god is already the best possible in these
respects, Plato reasoned, a god cannot change for the better. But
being perfect includes being immune to change for the worse &mdash;
too powerful to suffer it without permission and too good to permit
it. Thus a god cannot improve or deteriorate. Plato&rsquo;s argument
had great historical influence. But it overlooked changes which
neither better nor worsen. If one first knows that it is 11:59:59 and
then knows that it is midnight, one is not better or worse for the
change. If the best possible state of mind includes omniscience, then
perhaps it includes constant change which neither better nor worsen
God, e.g., in what precise time God knows it is. Perhaps constant
omniscience requires constant change to &lsquo;keep up with&rsquo;
time. At 11:59:59 it is surely better to know that it is now 11:59:59,
and then at midnight it is better to know that it is now midnight.
Plato&rsquo;s argument does not rule out such changes.</p>

<p>
Aristotle also contributed to acceptance of the full DDI. For many
medieval theists accepted Aristotle&rsquo;s case for God&rsquo;s
existence. Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Physics</em> reasoned that if change
occurs, it has a final source, an eternally unchanged changer.
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>De Caelo</em> added that something is eternally
unchanged only if unchangeable. Later theists thought the role of
first cause of change too lofty not to be God&rsquo;s. Writers who
took Aristotle&rsquo;s argument or its descendants to prove
God&rsquo;s existence found themselves committed to DDI.</p>

<p>
Augustine gave a powerful impetus to Christian acceptance of DDI. As
he saw it (<em>De Trinitate</em> V, 2), a God who gave His very name
as &ldquo;I am&rdquo; and is perfect must be the perfect case of
being. But what can change, Augustine thought, is not a perfect case
of being: it does not have its being so securely that it cannot cease
to be what it is.</p>

<p>
Boethius&rsquo; <em>Consolation of Philosophy</em> (V, 6) also helped
make DDI popular. Boethius held that being in time must involve
defects, as it entails having a past and a future. If temporal lives
have past parts, temporal things are no longer living them. They are
deprived of their pasts. They do not yet live the future parts of
their lives, and this is another sort of deprivation. Both
deprivations are defects, according to Boethius. So if God is free of
all defects, Boethius reasoned, God has no past or future. What has no
past or future does not change. For what changes goes from what it was
to what it was going to be, and so has a past and a future. Hence, to
Boethius, perfection required changelessness. Necessary perfection is
better than contingent perfection, and so by perfect-being reasoning
is God&rsquo;s. If perfection entails changelessness, necessary
perfection entails being immutable.</p>

<p>
Now Boethius&rsquo; reasoning requires at least some cleaning up. If
one&rsquo;s past or future have bad episodes, it is not a bad thing
not to be living them. But if God is truly perfect, His life cannot
contain parts it is overall bad to live. Again, we must expand
Boethius&rsquo; thought about the past. For one thing, if a temporal
thing is not alive, it in no sense really misses or is deprived of its
past. But being non-alive is itself an inferior state of being.
Further, a temporal life may have no past parts; the temporal thing
might be instantaneous, or just beginning to exist. But either way, it
has missed out on any previous time there was- a deprivation. Further,
it is a deprivation to exist for only an instant. If there was no
previous time, the temporal thing is instantaneous or beginning to
exist at the first instant of time Again, being instantaneous is a
deprivation. A thing beginning to exist at the first instant of time
is for Boethius and Western theists a creature being newly created.
Being causally dependent for existence seems to many a defect, and
being a creature is an inferior status. So on this limb of the
argument too, we get to an imperfection. Thus a suitable expansion of
Boethius&rsquo; argument about the past may have some merit, and one
can treat his thought about the future in broadly similar ways.</p>

<p>
Boethius actually followed his reasoning about divine perfection to
the conclusion that God exists outside time. For whatever has neither
past nor future is not located in time. But change requires existence
in time. Suppose that a turnip, aging, goes from fresh to spoiled. It
also then goes from fresh to not-fresh. So first &ldquo;the turnip is
fresh&rdquo; is true, then &ldquo;it is not the case that the turnip
is fresh&rdquo; is true. The two cannot be true at once. So things
change only if they exist at at least two distinct times. Hence, if
God is necessarily atemporal &mdash; via <em>necessary</em> divine
perfection &mdash; God is necessarily changeless, i.e., immutable. </p>

<p>
Aquinas (like Augustine) derived DDI from the deeper classical-theist
doctrine of divine simplicity (ST Ia 9). If God is simple, God has no
parts of any sort. Now when a thing changes, it becomes partly
different. Were this not so, no change would have occurred. But it
cannot become different in <em>every</em> respect. For if it did, it
would become different with respect to being identical with this
thing. If first we have something identical with this turnip and then
we have something not identical with it, the turnip has not changed,
but disappeared and been replaced by something else. So whatever
changes must stay partly the same (else there was not change in one
selfsame surviving thing). Thus whatever can change is divisible in
some way into what would stay and what would go if it changed. If so,
a simple God cannot change. Moreover, classical theists- as well as
such critics as Scotus and Ockham- universally understood God&rsquo;s
simplicity as ruling out possession of accidents. Of course, what has
no accidents cannot change in accidents. Further, a simplicity which
rules out accidents cannot itself be an accidental property, and must
therefore be essential. Thus such simplicity dictates not just no
actual accidental change but immutability. DDI&rsquo;s connection with
divine simplicity and the classical theist theory of God&rsquo;s
perfection which centers on divine simplicity is one of the deepest
reasons for DDI&rsquo;s broad historical appeal; one cannot fully
explain what moved thinkers to accept DDI without also treating the
motivation for the doctrine of divine simplicity. That, however, is
too large a topic to broach here.</p>

<p>
DDI, then, has a variety of religious and philosophical roots.</p>

<h2><a name="4">4. Arguments Against Immutability</a></h2>

<p>
There are many arguments against DDI. Avicenna originated one that
Norman Kretzmann (1966) re-invented. We can put a version of it this
way:</p>

<ol>

<li>If God is omniscient, God knows what time it is now.</li>

<li>What time it is now is constantly changing. So</li>

<li>What God knows is constantly changing. So</li>

<li>God is constantly changing.</li>
</ol>

<p>
(2) assumes that in addition to such facts as that t is present at t
and t+1 is present at t+1, there are facts about which time is present
in an absolute sense, present <em>simpliciter</em>: that if it is now
t, t is not just present at t, but present full stop. Some responses
to (1)-(4) deny this assumption and so deny (2), e.g., Helm (1988).
Also, Kretzmann and others who push the argument speak as if there is
a unique universal present, but this is inessential: if due to
relativity we were to say that there are different nows in different
places, an omniscient God would have to know what time it is now at
all of them.</p>

<p>
Aquinas reports &ldquo;ancient nominalists&rdquo; as denying (3)
&mdash; they claimed that what God knows is simply an event, the
nativity of Christ. So as they saw it, the sentences &ldquo;Christ was
born&rdquo; and &ldquo;Christ will be born&rdquo; signify the same
thing, since they signify the same event (ST Ia 14, 15 ad 3), and so
the objects of divine knowledge these sentences express do not differ.
Aquinas objects that the differences in the sentences cause them to
express different propositions, and so concedes that it is not true
that whatever proposition ever expresses what God knows, always
expresses what God knows. But he adds that this does not mean that
God&rsquo;s knowledge itself changes, because He does not know what He
knows by affirming propositions (ibid.). Rather, His knowledge is a
timeless intuition which shows that propositions are at one time true
and another false (ibid. et De Ver. 2, 5 ad 11; for commentary see
Sullivan 1991). Aquinas, then, also denies (3).</p>

<p>
Hector-Neri Casta&ntilde;eda replied to Kretzmann by way of the claim
that</p>

<blockquote>
P. If <em>x</em> knows that <em>y</em> knows that <em>p</em>,
<em>x</em> knows that <em>p</em> (1967, 207).
</blockquote>

<p>
(P) is plausible. If <em>x</em> knows that <em>y</em> knows that
<em>p</em>, <em>x</em> knows that <em>p</em> is true, since knowledge
entails truth. But it is at least plausible that if <em>x</em> knows
that <em>p</em> is true, <em>x</em> knows that <em>p</em>. Suppose,
then, that our immutable being is an atemporal God, seeing time from
without. God knows that Smith, at <em>t</em>, knows that it is now
<em>t</em>. God knows that Jones, at <em>t</em>+1, knows that it is
now <em>t</em>+1. By (P), God atemporally knows both propositions,
without having to change. Swinburne objects: a proposition does not
just (say) predicate properties of an individual, but presents the
individual to <em>x</em> a particular way, and <em>y</em> does not
know what <em>x</em> does unless what <em>y</em> tokens to <em>y</em>
presents that individual to <em>y</em> the same way what <em>x</em>
tokens to <em>x</em> presents it to <em>x</em> (1993, 170&ndash;1).
However, Swinburne may equivocate on &ldquo;what y knows.&rdquo; It is
one thing for <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> to know the same proposition,
and another, perhaps, for the proposition to have the same overall
cognitive significance for <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>. A mode of
presentation might affect overall significance without providing
further information that might be stated in a further proposition.
Still, Casta&ntilde;eda&rsquo;s move does fail, for (P) is in fact
false. If I know that God is omniscient, then for any proposition p, I
know that God knows that p. But I may still not know that p. I know
that God knows the date of the Second Coming. But I still do not know
the day nor the hour.</p>

<p>
Edward Wierenga (1989, 175&ndash;90) offered two replies to (1)-(4),
based on differing accounts of what propositions God believes and the
requirements of omniscience. On one, present-tensed sentences express
propositions predicating properties of whatever time has a
time-haecceity <em>T</em>, they and all other propositions are
eternally true, and being omniscient is knowing all truths. Knowers in
time have access to the time with <em>T</em>, and perhaps <em>T</em>
itself, only at that time. So what changes over time is not what is
true, but what temporal believers have access to. But (Wierenga notes)
there is no reason to think that an atemporal believer would suffer
similar access limits. (After all, plausibly it is being in time that
imposes them.) So on this account, an atemporal, immutable believer
timelessly knows the same truths temporal believers know only at some
times. In effect, Wierenga denies that (2) implies (3): if all truths
are eternally true, what is true does not change. Kvanvig 1986 makes a
broadly similar move.</p>

<p>
William Craig has argued that this move is incompatible with holding
that time really passes (2001, 119&ndash;23). In a sense, Wierenga
need not care. He was not aiming to show that omniscience,
immutability and passage are compatible, but only that omniscience
and immutability are compatible. If the conjunction of omniscience,
immutability and a denial of passage is consistent, its members are
pairwise consistent, for if there were a contradiction between any two
conjuncts, the whole conjunction would ipso facto be inconsistent. But
in any case, Craig&rsquo;s charge misfires. Wierenga&rsquo;s first
move is compatible with real passage. It entails only that if time
passes, passage is not represented by first one thing and then another
being true. Passage is instead represented by something within the
overall set of eternal truths- perhaps something as simple as an
assertion that time passes, or even that each time, when present, is
all there is to temporal reality. Passage can also appear in our story
as what explains change in what we have access to and perhaps in the
overall cognitive import of our belief-states. Wierenga&rsquo;s view
can allow that the times he speaks pass, and exist only when present.
The view requires not that times be tenselessly there but that their
haecceities be always and atemporally available.</p>

<p>
On Wierenga&rsquo;s second move, there is no such thing as truth
simpliciter. Rather, all truth is truth at a perspective (a pair
&lt;<em>S</em>, <em>t</em>&gt; of a person and a time). If I am
sitting now but was not sitting at midnight, the second move does not
say that the proposition &lt;I am sitting&gt; first was not true and
then was. Rather, it says that &lt;I am sitting&gt; is true at &lt;me,
now&gt; but false at &lt;me, midnight&gt;. Given this machinery,
Wierenga defines omniscience this way: <em>x</em> is omniscient just
if for all propositions <em>p</em> and perspectives &lt;<em>S</em>,
<em>t</em>&gt;, if <em>p</em> is true at &lt;<em>S</em>,
<em>t</em>&gt;, <em>x</em> knows this, and if <em>x</em> is at
&lt;<em>S</em>, <em>t</em>&gt; and <em>p</em> is true at
&lt;<em>S</em>, <em>t</em>&gt;, <em>x</em> knows that <em>p</em>. With
these moves, it&rsquo;s easy to show that atemporal (and so immutable)
omniscience is possible if there can be such a thing as an atemporal
perspective. If so, those pushing (1)&ndash;(4) can rule out immutable
omniscience only if they can provide independent reason to think that
necessarily, all perspectives are temporal. If they have that, of
course, they do not need (1)&ndash;(4), because if God is temporal and
persists, His perspective changes and so what He must know to be
omniscient changes. Thus (1)&ndash;(4) turns out dialectically
impotent and otiose.</p>

<p>
Craig claims that recourse to truth-at-a-perspective is incompatible
with real passage and a real absolute present (2004, 107). This is so,
he thinks, because propositions true at <em>t</em> must be true
simpliciter when <em>t</em> is the unique objective present. But why
think so? Here is another view: when <em>t</em> is the unique
objective present, all temporal perspectives that actually exist
include <em>t</em>, truths indexed to t are true at all actually
existing perspectives, but there is no such thing as truth
simpliciter. Unless there is some hidden inconsistency here, passage
and an absolute present do not require truth simpliciter. On
Wierenga&rsquo;s move, omniscience does not require that perspectives
be tenselessly there. It requires that propositions about them be
always and perhaps atemporally available, which one can assure by
taking &ldquo;<em>t</em>&rdquo; as shorthand for &ldquo;some time with
haecceity <em>T</em>&rdquo; and letting haecceities exist
necessarily.</p>

<p>
The second move works given passage and an absolute present, but has a
consequence friends of these may not like. Suppose that time really
passes: indeed, suppose presentism, on which only the fleeting present
is real. Then first &lt;it is now <em>t</em>&gt; is true at those
temporal perspectives that include <em>t</em> (on presentism, there
are no others) and then it is false at all perspectives (on
presentism, since <em>t</em> is now past, there are only temporal
perspectives in which it is false). But at an atemporal perspective,
it is never true that it is now <em>t</em>, for any <em>t</em>. There
is no time it is in eternity; if there were, eternality would not be
an atemporal mode of being. So at an atemporal perspective, time
simply does not pass, there is nothing about passage to know, and this
is why passage poses no problem for immutable omniscience. Passage is
real in time, then, but not at an atemporal perspective. Requiring an
atemporal being to know that it is now noon to count as omniscient is
like requiring someone at midnight to know that it is now noon to
count as omniscient: what is not true at one&rsquo;s perspective is
not knowable at one&rsquo;s perspective either.</p>

<p>
Of course, one wants to know how to make sense of the idea that
passage is real only in time. Stump and Kretzmann (1981) gave a take
on this while retracting Kretzmann&rsquo;s original endorsement of
(1)&ndash;(4). Suppose presentism. On the Stump-Kretzmann picture,
each time t, when present, is &ldquo;ET-simultaneous&rdquo; with the
life of an eternal being. So that life is ET-simultaneous with t. So
all times, precisely in their presentness, are ET-simultaneous with an
eternal life. In an eternal life, nothing passes. If it did, that life
would have earlier and later parts: it would be temporal, not eternal.
So in God&rsquo;s eternal life, each time, precisely in its
presentness, remains: nothing ever ceases to be ET-simultaneous with
God&rsquo;s life. So while times pass in time, they do not pass
relative to eternity. Leftow (1991) offers a broadly similar picture,
but works with a differently-defined simultaneity-relation.</p>

<p>
Other arguments against DDI appeal to Scripture&rsquo;s depiction of
God as changing, e.g., in the Flood story (<em>Genesis</em> 6:6).
Facing such texts, DDI&rsquo;s friends defuse the appearance of divine
change by appeal to doctrines less speculative and theoretical than
DDI. Thus Philo argues from God&rsquo;s foreknowledge of the future
and constancy of character that God cannot repent or feel regret, as
the Flood story suggests. The Incarnation is an especially knotty
problem for DDI&rsquo;s Christian friends. In general, these argue
that all change it involved occurred in the human nature God the Son
assumed rather than in God; God was eternally ready to be incarnate,
and eternally had those experiences of the earthly Christ which the
Incarnation makes part of his life. Through changes in Mary and the
infant she bore, what was eternally in God eventually took place on
earth.</p>

<p>
Another argument against DDI appeals to God&rsquo;s power. Before
Creation, God could assure that no universe ever existed. God has this
power now only if he can alter the past. Few think he can. So events
seem to change God&rsquo;s power. DDI&rsquo;s defenders reply that God
always has all power he ever has, but has lost a chance to use it.
Because He has, we no longer want to <em>call</em> his power a power
to prevent a universe. But He is still (they claim) as able to do it
as He was.</p>

<p>
Swinburne has argued that immutability is incompatible with acting
freely, writing that an &ldquo;agent is perfectly free at a certain
time if his action results from his own choice at that time and if his
choice is not itself brought about by anything else. Yet a person
immutable in the strong sense would be unable to perform any action at
a certain time other than what he had previously intended to do. His
course of action being fixed by his past choices, he would not be
perfectly free&rdquo; (1993, p. 222). One thing to note here is that
if my past choices fix my present choice, it does not follow that they
bring it about. It may only follow that it is inevitable that I myself
bring that choice about at that time. So it is not at all clear that
immutability is incompatible even with Swinburnean perfect freedom.
More importantly, Swinburne&rsquo;s &ldquo;perfect freedom&rdquo; is a
particularly demanding notion. Even if my own past choices do bring
about my present choice, many libertarians would allow that my present
choice is derivatively free and responsible if the past choices that
brought it about were libertarian-free (see, e.g., Kane 1996, Stump
1996, Ekstrom 2000). Most theists would be quite content with a God
with full libertarian freedom.</p>

<p>
A final objection assumes that time passes, and runs this way: what is
related to God changes. First God co-exists with one time&rsquo;s
being present, then He co-exists with another&rsquo;s being present.
If what is related to God changes, God changes in relational accident.
One reply is to hold that God is atemporal. If He is, at His own
standpoint, what is related to Him does not change. . Perhaps, then,
defending DDI requires commitment to divine timelessness.</p>

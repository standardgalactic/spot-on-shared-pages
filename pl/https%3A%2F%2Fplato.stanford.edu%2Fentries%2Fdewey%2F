<h1>John Dewey</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Nov 1, 2018; substantive revision Sun Mar 31, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
John Dewey (1859&ndash;1952) was one of American pragmatism&rsquo;s
early founders, along with Charles Sanders Peirce and William James,
and arguably the most prominent American intellectual for the first
half of the twentieth century. Dewey&rsquo;s educational theories and
experiments had global reach, his psychological theories influenced
that growing science, and his writings about democratic theory and
practice helped shape academic and practical debates for decades.
Dewey developed extensive and often systematic views in ethics,
epistemology, logic, metaphysics, aesthetics, and philosophy of
religion. Because Dewey&rsquo;s approach was typically genealogical,
couching his views within philosophy&rsquo;s larger history, one finds
in Dewey a fully developed metaphilosophy.</p>

<p>
Dewey&rsquo;s &ldquo;cultural naturalism&rdquo; (which he favored over
&ldquo;pragmatism&rdquo; and &ldquo;instrumentalism&rdquo;) is a
critique and reconstruction of philosophy within the ambit of a
Darwinian worldview (Lamont 1961; MW4: 3). Following William James,
Dewey thought philosophy had become overly technical and
intellectualistic, divorced from assessing everyday social conditions
and values (<em>FAE</em>, LW5: 157&ndash;58). Philosophy, he believed,
needed to be reconnected with education-for-living (philosophy as
&ldquo;the general theory of education&rdquo;), viz., social criticism
at the most general level, a &ldquo;criticism of criticisms&rdquo;
(<em>EN</em>, LW1: 298; see also <em>DE</em>, MW9: 338).</p>

<p>
Understood within the Darwinian evolutionary arena, philosophy becomes
an activity taken by interdependent organisms-in- environments. From
this standpoint of active adaptation, Dewey criticized traditional
philosophers&rsquo; tendency to abstract and reify concepts derived
from living contexts. Along with other classical pragmatists, Dewey
critiqued metaphysical and epistemological dualisms (e.g., mind/body,
nature/culture, self/society, and reason/emotion) reconstructing their
elements as parts of larger continuities. For example, human thinking
is not a phenomenon categorically external from the world it seeks to
know; indeed, such knowing is <em>not</em> a purely rational attempt
to escape illusion and discover ultimate &ldquo;reality&rdquo; or
&ldquo;truth&rdquo;. Rather, knowing is one among <em>many</em> ways
organisms with evolved capacities for thought and language cope with
problems. Minds, then, are not passive observers but are engines of
active adaptation, experimentation, and innovation; ideas and theories
are not rational fulcrums to transcend culture, but rather function
within culture, adjudged on situated, pragmatic grounds. Knowing,
then, is no &ldquo;divine spark&rdquo;, for while knowing (or
<em>inquiry</em>, to use Dewey&rsquo;s term) includes calculative or
rational elements, these are agentially entangled with the body and
emotions.</p>

<p>
Beyond academia, Dewey was an active public intellectual, infusing
contemporary issues with insights found in philosophy. He addressed
topics of broad moral significance, such as human freedom, economic
alienation, race relations, women&rsquo;s suffrage, war and peace, and
educational methods and goals. Typically, he integrated discoveries
made via public inquiries back into his academic theories. This
<em>practice-theory-practice</em> rhythm powered every area of
Dewey&rsquo;s intellectual enterprise, and perhaps explains the
enduring usefulness of his philosophy in many academic and practical
arenas. The fecundity of Dewey&rsquo;s ideas continues to manifest in
aesthetics, education, environmental policy, information theory,
journalism, medicine, political theory, psychiatry, public
administration, sociology, and philosophy, per se.</p>

<h2 id="BiogSket">1. Biographical Sketch</h2>

<p>
John Dewey lead an active and multifarious life. He is the subject of
numerous biographies and an enormous literature interpreting and
evaluating his extraordinary body of work: forty books and
approximately seven hundred articles in over one hundred and forty
journals.</p>

<p>
Dewey was born in Burlington, Vermont on October 20, 1859 to Archibald
Dewey, a merchant, and Lucina Rich Dewey. Dewey was the third of four
sons; the first, Dewey&rsquo;s namesake, died in infancy. He grew up
in Burlington, was raised in the Congregationalist Church, and
attended public schools. After studying Latin and Greek in high
school, Dewey entered the University of Vermont at fifteen and
graduated in 1879 at nineteen. After college, Dewey taught high school
for two years in Oil City, Pennsylvania. Subsequent time in Vermont
studying philosophy with former professor H.A.P. Torrey, along with
the encouragement of the editor of the <em>Journal of Speculative
Philosophy</em>, W.T. Harris, helped Dewey decide to attend graduate
school in philosophy at Johns Hopkins University in 1882. There, his
study included logic with Charles S. Peirce (which Dewey found too
&ldquo;mathematical&rdquo;, and did not pursue), the history of
philosophy with George Sylvester Morris, and physiological and
experimental psychology with Granville Stanley Hall (who trained with
Wilhelm Wundt in Leipzig and with William James at
 Harvard).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Though Dewey later attributed important credit to Peirce&rsquo;s
pragmatism for his mature views, Peirce had no sizable impact during
graduate school. There, his main influences&mdash;Neo-Hegelian
idealism, Darwinian biology, and Wundtian experimental
psychology&mdash; created a tension he fought to resolve. Was the
world fundamentally biological, functional, and material or was it
inherently creative and spiritual? In no small part, Dewey&rsquo;s
career was launched by his attempt to mediate and harmonize these
views. While sharing the idea of &ldquo;organism&rdquo;, Dewey also
saw in both &mdash; and rejected&mdash; any aspects he deemed overly
abstract, atomizing, or reductionistic. His earliest attempts to
create a &ldquo;new psychology&rdquo; (aimed at merging experimental
psychology with idealism) sought a method to understand experience as
integrated and whole. As a result, Dewey&rsquo;s early approach
modified English absolute idealism. In 1884, two years after
matriculating, Dewey graduated with a dissertation criticizing Kant
from an Idealist position (&ldquo;The Psychology of Kant&rdquo;); it
remains lost.</p>

<p>
While scholars still debate the degree to which Dewey&rsquo;s mature
philosophy retained early Hegelian influences, Hegel&rsquo;s
<em>personal</em> influence on Dewey was profound. New England&rsquo;s
religious culture, Dewey recalled, imparted an &ldquo;isolation of
self from the world, of soul from body, [and] of nature from
God&rdquo;, and he reacted with &ldquo;an inward laceration&rdquo; and
&ldquo;a painful oppression&rdquo;. His study (with George Sylvester
Morris) of British Idealist T.H. Green and G.W.F. Hegel afforded Dewey
personal and intellectual healing:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Hegel&rsquo;s synthesis of subject and object, matter and spirit, the
divine and the human, was, however, no mere intellectual formula; it
operated as an immense release, a liberation. Hegel&rsquo;s treatment
of human culture, of institutions and the arts, involved the same
dissolution of hard-and-fast dividing walls, and had a special
attraction for me. (<em>FAE</em>, LW5: 153)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Philosophically, early encounters with Hegelianism informed
Dewey&rsquo;s career-long quest to integrate, as dynamic wholes, the
various dimensions of experience (practical, imaginative, bodily,
psychical) that philosophy and psychology had defined as discrete.</p>

<p>
Dewey&rsquo;s family, as well as his reputation as a philosopher and
psychologist, grew while at various universities, including the
University of Michigan (1886&ndash; 88, 1889&ndash;1894) and the
University of Minnesota (1888&ndash;89). At Michigan, Dewey developed
long-term professional relationships with James Hayden Tufts and
George Herbert Mead. In 1886, Dewey married Harriet Alice Chipman;
they had six children and adopted one. Two of the boys died tragically
young (two and eight). Chipman had a significant influence on
Dewey&rsquo;s advocacy for women and his shift away from religious
orthodoxy. During this period, Dewey wrote articles critical of
British idealists from a Hegelian perspective; he taught James&rsquo;
<em>Principles of Psychology</em> (1890), and labeled his own view
&ldquo;experimental idealism&rdquo; (1894a, <em>The Study of
Ethics</em>, EW4: 264).</p>

<p>
In 1894, at Tuft&rsquo;s urging, President William Rainey Harper
offered Dewey leadership of the Philosophy Department at the
University of Chicago, which also included Psychology and Pedagogy.
Motivated to put these disciplines into active collaboration, Dewey
accepted and began building the department by hiring G.H. Mead from
Michigan and J.R. Angell, a former student at Michigan (who also
studied with James at Harvard). Dubbed the &ldquo;Chicago
School&rdquo; by William James, Dewey, Tufts, Angell, Mead and several
others developed &ldquo;psychological functionalism&rdquo;. He also
published the seminal &ldquo;Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology&rdquo;
(1896, EW5; hereafter <em>RAC</em>), and broke from transcendental
idealism and his church.</p>

<p>
At Chicago, Dewey founded The Laboratory School, a site to test
psychological and educational theories. Dewey&rsquo;s wife Alice was
the principal from 1896&ndash;1904. Dewey became active in
Chicago&rsquo;s social and political causes, including Jane
Addams&rsquo; Hull House; Addams became a close personal friend of the
Dewey&rsquo;s. Dewey and his biographer, daughter Jane Dewey, credited
Addams with helping him develop his views on democracy, education, and
philosophy. The significance of Dewey&rsquo;s intellectual debt to
Addams is still being uncovered (&ldquo;Biography of John
Dewey&rdquo;, Dewey 1939a; see also Seigfried 1999, Fischer 2013).</p>

<p>
In 1904, conflicts related to the Laboratory School lead Dewey to
resign his Chicago positions and move to the philosophy department at
Columbia University in New York City. There, he established an
affiliation with Columbia&rsquo;s Teacher&rsquo;s College. Important
influences at Columbia included F.J.E. Woodbridge, Wendell T. Bush,
W.P. Montague, Charles A. Beard (political theory) and Franz Boas
(anthropology). Dewey retired from Columbia in 1930, going on to
produce eleven more books.</p>

<p>
In addition to many significant academic publications, Dewey wrote for
various non-academic audiences, notably in the <em>New Republic</em>;
he was active in leading, supporting, or founding a number of
important organizations including the American Civil Liberties Union,
the American Association of University Professors, the American
Philosophical Association, the American Psychological Association, and
the New School for Social Research. Dewey spoke out to support
progressive politics and social change. His renown as a philosopher
and educator lead to numerous invitations; in 1922, he inaugurated the
Paul Carus Lectures (revised and published as <em>Experience and
Nature</em>, 1925), gave the 1928 Gifford Lectures (revised and
published as <em>The Quest for Certainty</em>, 1929), and gave the
1933&ndash;34 Terry Lectures at Yale (published as <em>A Common
Faith</em>, 1934a). He traveled for two years in Japan and China, and
made notable trips to Turkey, Mexico, the Soviet Union, and South
Africa.</p>

<p>
In 1946, almost two decades after Alice Chipman Dewey died (1927),
Dewey married Roberta Lowitz Grant. John Dewey died of pneumonia in
his home in New York City on June 1, 1952.</p>

<h2 id="Psyc">2. Psychology</h2>

<p>
Dewey&rsquo;s involvement with psychology began early. He hoped the
emerging discipline would answer philosophy&rsquo;s deepest questions.
His initial approach resembled Hegelian Idealism, though it did not
incorporate Hegel&rsquo;s dialectical logic; instead he sought new
methods in psychology (Alexander 2020). By overcoming longstanding
divisions (between subject and object, matter and spirit, etc.) he
would show how human experiences &mdash;physical, psychical,
practical, and imaginative &mdash;all integrate in one, dynamic person
(<em>FAE</em>, LW5: 153). Dewey&rsquo;s large ambitions for psychology
(as <em>the</em> new science of self-consciousness), imagined it as
the &ldquo;completed method of philosophy&rdquo; (&ldquo;Psychology as
Philosophic Method&rdquo;, EW1: 157). Nominally a textbook,
<em>Psychology</em> (1887 EW2) introduced psychology&rsquo;s study of
the self as ultimate reality.</p>

<p>
Dewey developed his own psychological theories. Extant accounts of
behavior were flawed, premised upon outdated and false philosophical
assumptions. (He eventually judged that such larger questions about
the meaning of human existence exceeded the resources of psychology.)
Dewey&rsquo;s work at this time reconstructed components of human
conduct (instincts, perceptions, habits, acts, emotions, and conscious
thought) and these proved integral to later, mature accounts of
experience. They informed his lifelong contention that mind, contrary
to long tradition, is <em>not</em> fundamentally subjective and
isolated, but social and interactive, emerging in nature and
culture.</p>

<h3 id="AssoIntrPhysPsyc">2.1 Associationism, Introspectionism, and Physiological Psychology</h3>

<p>
Dewey&rsquo;s entry into psychology coincided with two dominant
trends: introspectionism (arising from associationism, a.k.a.,
&ldquo;mentalism&rdquo;) and the newer physiological psychology
(imported from Germany). Earlier British empiricists, such as John
Locke and David Hume, explained intelligent behavior with (1)
internally inspected (&ldquo;introspected&rdquo;) entities, including
perceptual experiences (e.g., &ldquo;impressions&rdquo;), and (2)
thoughts or ideas (e.g., &ldquo;images&rdquo;). These accrue toward
intelligence via an elaborate process of associative learning.
Discovery-by-introspection was indispensable to many empiricists, and
to physiological <em>cum</em> experimental psychologists (e.g.,
Wundt).</p>

<p>
Dewey was deeply influenced by graduate study of physiological
psychology with G. Stanley Hall, whose classes included theoretical,
physiological, and experimental psychology. Dewey conducted laboratory
experiments on attention. Unlike the introspectionists, Hall&rsquo;s
methods incorporated strict experimental controls, a biology-based
approach which proffered Dewey an organic and holistic model of
experience capable of overcoming the subjectivist dualisms plaguing
the older, associationist
 models.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 However, Dewey still found experience atomized and mechanistic in
physiological psychology, stemming from a reliance upon &ldquo;sense
data&rdquo;. From his Hegelian perspective, this psychology could
never account for a wider, socio-cultural world. Briefly, for Dewey,
&ldquo;organism&rdquo; entails &ldquo;environment&rdquo; and
&ldquo;environment&rdquo; entails &ldquo;culture&rdquo;. A rigorously
empirical psychology could restrict study to &ldquo;the&rdquo; mind
but was bound to forge connections with other
 sciences.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="ReflArcDeweRecoPsyc">2.2 The &ldquo;Reflex Arc&rdquo; and Dewey&rsquo;s Reconstruction of Psychology</h3>

<p>
Dewey sought an account of psychological experience that respected
experimental limits <em>and</em> culture&rsquo;s pervasive influences.
James&rsquo;s tour de force, <em>The Principles of Psychology</em>
(1890), modeled how to explain the conscious and intelligent self
without appealing to a transcendental Absolute. The
<em>Principles&rsquo;</em> emphatically biological conception of mind,
Dewey recalled, gave his thinking &ldquo;a new direction and
quality&rdquo; and &ldquo;worked its way more and more into all my
ideas and acted as a ferment to transform old beliefs&rdquo;
(<em>FAE</em>, LW5: 157). Rather than measuring psychic phenomena
against preexisting abstractions, it deployed a &ldquo;radical
empiricism&rdquo; that starts from lived experience&rsquo;s actual
phases and elements and aims to understand its functional origins.</p>

<p>
One expression of this Jamesean turn was Dewey&rsquo;s seminal
critique of the reflex arc concept (1896). The &ldquo;reflex
arc&rdquo; model of behavior was an influential way to empirically and
experimentally explain human behavior using stimulus-response
(cause-effect) pairings. It sought to displace less observable and
testable approaches relying upon &ldquo;psychic entities&rdquo; or
&ldquo;mental substance&rdquo;. In the model, a passive organism
encounters an external stimulus, causing a sensory and motor response
&mdash; a child sees a candle (stimulus), grasps it (response), burns
her hand (stimulus), and pulls her hand back (response). This makes
explicit <em>the</em> event&rsquo;s basic stimuli and responses,
describing connections in mechanistic and physiological terms. No
recourse to mysterious and unobservable entities is necessary.</p>

<p>
Dewey criticized the reflex arc on several grounds. First, events
(sensory stimulus, central response, and act) are artificially
separated for purposes of analysis. &ldquo;The reflex arc&rdquo;,
Dewey wrote, &ldquo;is not a comprehensive, or organic unity, but a
patchwork of disjointed parts, a mechanical conjunction of unallied
processes&rdquo; (<em>RAC</em>, EW5: 97). Second, the model falsifies
genuine interaction; organisms do not <em>passively</em> receive
stimuli and then <em>actively</em> respond; rather, organisms
<em>continuously interact</em> with environments in cumulative and
modifying ways. The child encountering a candle is <em>already</em>
actively exploring, anticipating; noticing a flame modifies
<em>ongoing</em> actions. &ldquo;The real beginning is with the act of
seeing; it is looking, and not a sensation of light&rdquo;
(<em>RAC</em>, EW5: 97). Third, the model too rigidly designates
certain events (<em>the</em> stimulus, <em>the</em> response); it
reifies them and ignores a wider, ongoing matrix of activity.
Effectively, Dewey was pointing out the ironic fact that the reflex
arc model &mdash; intending to shed metaphysical assumptions &mdash;
was inadvertently creating new ones. We are seeking to discover, Dewey
argued, &ldquo;what stimulus or sensation, what movement and response
<em>mean</em>&rdquo; and we are finding that &ldquo;they mean
distinctions of flexible <em>function</em> only, not of fixed
<em>existence</em>&rdquo; (<em>RAC</em>, EW5: 102; emphasis mine). His
suggestion is pragmatic; rather than an <em>underlying</em> reality
(<em>pure</em> stimulus, <em>pure</em> response), psychology should
look to meanings. Pragmatically, then, terms such as stimulus,
response, sensation, and movement &ldquo;mean distinctions of flexible
function only, not of fixed existence&rdquo; (<em>RAC</em>, EW5: 102).
Meanings of terms are understood once they are seen as functional acts
in a dynamic context that includes aims and
 interests.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Dewey&rsquo;s critique and reconstruction of the reflex arc presaged
other important developments in his pragmatism. The wider lesson was
the need to pay greater attention to context and function, and he
applied it over his career to science more broadly, and to logic and
mathematics. This was a warning not to mistake analyses&rsquo;
eventual outcomes as evidence for already-existing
 entities.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
 It was also a reminder that specific applications of theory earned
salience by their value in a longer temporal context, checked both
prospectively and retrospectively.</p>

<p>
Rather than recount Dewey&rsquo;s extensive reconstruction of the
human self, here is a cursory review to illustrate how he developed
some basic notions: instincts/impulses, perceptions, sensations,
habits, emotions, sentiency, consciousness, and mind.</p>

<h3 id="Inst">2.3 Instincts/Impulses</h3>

<p>
James had already attacked attempts to explain complex, developed
behavior by reference to preexisting impulses and instincts (e.g.,
&ldquo;Habit&rdquo;, James 1890: chapter 4); Dewey continued the
assault. Such explanations fail to consider instinct&rsquo;s plastic
and pliable character. Across a variety of individuals, instincts
considered simple or basic are anything but&mdash;they blossom into
many different habits and
 customs.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
 Also, instincts are not pushing an essentially passive creature, but
are actively taken up in diverse circumstances, for diverse purposes.
&ldquo;Instinct&rdquo;, like &ldquo;stimulus&rdquo;, has meaning
depending upon contextual factors which may include biological and
socio-linguistic responses. There is no psychology without social
psychology, no plausible inquiry into pure, biological instincts (or
other &ldquo;natural&rdquo; powers) without consideration of social
and environmental factors, let alone the particularities of a given
inquiry. As interactive phenomena-in-environment, instincts/impulses
are better framed as transactions (<em>HNC</em>, MW14: 66).</p>

<h3 id="Perc">2.4 Perception/Sensation</h3>

<p>
Dewey&rsquo;s argument about instincts applied to perception and
sensation as well &mdash; do not base an empirical science on
unquestioned, metaphysical posits, and do not rely upon strictly
analytical methods that use simple elements to build up complex
behavior. Too often, such methods are inadequate to explain
psychological phenomena. Accordingly, Dewey attacked the then-common
view that a perception (1) was simply and externally caused, (2)
completely occupied a mental state, and (3) was passively received
into an empty mental space.</p>

<p>
Such elements grow out of an erroneous &ldquo;psychophysical
dualism&rdquo; that radically separates perceiver from world. Consider
(1), perception as causation. Perception as simply and externally
caused is contravened by the Darwinian, ecological model. There,
organism-environment interactions include, <em>but are not
ontologically reducible to</em>, &ldquo;minds&rdquo;,
&ldquo;bodies&rdquo;, and their impingements&mdash; the so-called
&ldquo;impressions&rdquo; and &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; of modern
philosophy. We <em>do</em> encounter surprising, unbidden events but
such occurrences do <em>not</em> justify leaping to metaphysical
conclusions, that there is a world &ldquo;out there&rdquo; and a mind
&ldquo;in here&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
While experience is profoundly qualitative, qualities are never simply
received nor are they contextless. This new view of qualities rejects
the longstanding dualism between &ldquo;objective&rdquo; and
&ldquo;subjective&rdquo;. A lemon&rsquo;s &ldquo;yellowness&rdquo; or
&ldquo;tartness&rdquo; are neither <em>in</em> a perceiver nor
<em>in</em> a lemon; each quality emerges from complex interactions
that can later be characterized (<em>as</em> &ldquo;tartness&rdquo;)
for reasons germane to the inquiry. Dewey wrote,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The qualities never were &lsquo;in&rsquo; the organism; they always
were qualities of interactions in which both extra-organic things and
organisms partake. (<em>EN</em>, LW1: 198&ndash;199)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, as discriminated, perceptions and qualities are made in inquiry
and language, not reports of ontological entities that are simple,
discrete, or ultimate. &ldquo;Perception&rdquo;, then, is shorthand
for more complicated interacting events. &ldquo;Red&rdquo; abstracts
from a more complex experience (e.g., red-car-merging-into-my-lane),
and the pragmatic question becomes, What is the function of this
abstraction? How does it mediate thought or action for future
experiences? (&ldquo;A Naturalistic Theory of Sense-Perception&rdquo;,
LW2: 51; <em>EN</em>, LW1: 198&ndash;199)</p>

<p>
Regarding (2), perceptions pervading mental states, Dewey echoes James
in &ldquo;The Stream of Thought&rdquo; (James 1890: chapter 9). While
a perception may occupy mental focus, there is also an attendant
&ldquo;fringe&rdquo; which contributes contrast and creates, in the
wider situation, an &ldquo;underlying qualitative character&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Qualitative Thought&rdquo;, LW5: 238 fn. 1). The
aforementioned &ldquo;tartness&rdquo; of the lemon relies for its
character upon a slew of &ldquo;fringe&rdquo; conditions (e.g.,
immediate past flavors, gustatory anticipations, etc.).</p>

<p>
Finally, regarding passive reception (3), perception is already a
&ldquo;taking up&rdquo; by organisms <em>already</em> functioning in
situations; there is no instantaneous and passive apprehension of
stimuli. Taking up always means selectivity, a process of adjustment
that take <em>some</em> time. Perception is never na&iuml;ve, never a
confrontation with some &ldquo;given&rdquo; content already imbued
with inherent meaning. Long before Wilfred Sellars (see
 <a href="../sellars/">entry on Sellars</a>)
 dismissed the passive-perception-encounter as modern
empiricism&rsquo;s &ldquo;Myth of the Given&rdquo;, Dewey had rebuked
such claims. All seeing is seeing <em>as</em> &mdash;adjustments
within larger acts. These habits of adjustment can change (subsequent
selections and interpretations are modified), so what is perceived can
shift (<em>DE</em>, MW9: 346).</p>

<h3 id="ActsHabi">2.5 Acts and Habits</h3>

<p>
The 1896 &ldquo;Reflex Arc&rdquo; paper argued that simpler
constituents are insufficient to explain complex behavior; Dewey found
that the &ldquo;act&rdquo; provided a better starting point
(<em>HNC</em>, MW14: 105). Acts help organisms cope with their
environment; they direct movement. Acts exhibit selectivity and
express interest, which make things meaningful. Our ancestors&rsquo;
selective acts to satisfy instinctive hunger resulted in choosing
certain foods (safe) over others. Over time, more elaborate interest
in food becomes social norms (dining, e.g.) and aesthetic expectations
(cuisine).</p>

<p>
Following James and Peirce, Dewey integrates &ldquo;habit&rdquo;
deeply into his philosophy, using it to explain various dimensions of
human experience (biological, ethical, political, and aesthetic) as
manifested in complex and social behaviors&mdash;walking, talking,
cooking,
 conversing.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]
 </sup>Habits are complex, composed of acts which unfold in time. Acts
may begin with instinct borne of need and muddle toward reintegration
and satisfaction. To become a habit, an act-series changes gradually
and cumulatively; one act leads to the next. &ldquo;Habit&rdquo;
emerges when acts cumulatively link to structure experience. Habit,
Dewey wrote, &ldquo;is an acquired predisposition to <em>ways</em> or
modes of response, not to particular acts&rdquo; (<em>HNC</em>, MW14:
32). Such &ldquo;ways&rdquo; draw on past experiences, including
social and linguistic interaction. Habits shared by groups are
&ldquo;customs&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Dewey challenged assumptions about the routine nature of habits.
Habits may <em>become</em> routine, but are not strictly automatic or
insulated from conscious reformulation. Indeed, they <em>cannot</em>
be literally automatic because every situation is somehow new. Thus,
the same exact acts never repeat. Unlike machine routines, organic
habits remain plastic, changeable. Habitually eating sweets is subject
to contingency (toothache) and modification (restraint); thus,
conscious reflection is the first stage of habits&rsquo; revision.</p>

<p>
He also challenged the notion that habits were dormant powers, waiting
to be invoked. Instead, habits are &ldquo;energetic and dominating
ways of acting&rdquo; determining what we do and are: &ldquo;All
habits are demands for certain kinds of activity; and they constitute
the self&rdquo; (<em>HNC</em>, MW14: 22, 21). Habits are not
individual possessions or inner forces; rather, they are transactions
between organisms and environments, functions making adaptation or
reconstruction possible.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Habits enter into the <em>constitution</em> of the situation; they are
in and of it, not, so far as it is concerned, something outside of it.
(&ldquo;Brief Studies in Realism&rdquo;, MW6: 120)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Because situations are cultural as well as bio-physical, habits are
ineliminably social. So-called &ldquo;individual&rdquo; habits emerge
within the social world of friends, family, home, work, media, etc.
Change of habit, then, is not a project of invoking sheer willpower,
but rather one of intelligent inquiry into relevant, frequently wider
and social, conditions (psychological, sociological, economic,
etc.).</p>

<h3 id="Emot">2.6 Emotion</h3>

<p>
Dewey redescribed &ldquo;emotion&rdquo; as he did &ldquo;habit&rdquo;
&mdash; a basic form of involvement in &ldquo;coordinated
circuits&rdquo; of activity. But while habits are controlled responses
to problematic situations, emotion is not predominantly controlled or
organized; emotion is an organism&rsquo;s &ldquo;perturbation from
clash or failure of habit&rdquo; (<em>HNC</em>, MW14: 54). As with the
other psychological accounts, Dewey reconstructs emotion as
transactional with other experiences (also typically analyzed as
discrete &mdash; &ldquo;rational,&rdquo; &ldquo;physical,&rdquo;
etc.).</p>

<p>
Dewey&rsquo;s account draws upon Darwin and James. Darwin argued that
internal emotional states cause organic expressions which, depending
on their survival value, may be subject to natural selection. James
sought to decrease the distance between emotion and accompanying
bodily expression. In cases of emotion, a perception excites a pre-
organized physiological mechanism; recognizing such changes just
<em>is</em> the emotional experience: &ldquo;we feel sorry
<em>because</em> we cry, angry <em>because</em> we strike&rdquo;
(James 1890 [1981: 450]). Dewey&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Theory of
Emotion&rdquo; (1894b &amp; 1895, EW4) pushed James&rsquo; point
further, toward an integrated whole (feeling-and-expression).
<em>Being sad</em> is not merely <em>feeling sad</em> or <em>acting
sad</em> but is the purposive organism&rsquo;s overall experience. In
effect, Dewey is gently correcting James&rsquo; (1890) reiteration of
mind-body dualism. To understand emotion, we must see that &ldquo;the
mode of behavior is the primary thing&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Theory of
Emotion&rdquo;, EW4: 174). Like habits, emotions are not private
possessions but emerge from the dynamic organism-environment complex;
emotions are &ldquo;called out by objects, physical and
personal&rdquo; as an intentional &ldquo;response to an objective
situation&rdquo; (<em>EN</em>, LW1: 292). As I encounter a strange
dog, I am perplexed about how to react; usual habits are inhibited and
there is emotion. (&ldquo;The Theory of Emotion&rdquo;, EW4: 182) We
may say emotions are intentional insofar as they are
&ldquo;<em>to</em> or <em>from</em> or <em>about</em> something
objective, whether in fact or in idea&rdquo; and not merely reactions
&ldquo;in the head&rdquo; (<em>AE</em>, LW10: 72).</p>

<p>
Philosophically, emotion is a central feature of Dewey&rsquo;s
critique of traditional epistemology and metaphysics. By pursuing
simple or pure rational access (to truth, reality) such systems
misrepresent and castigate emotion as distraction, confused thought,
or bodily interference; naturally, emotion becomes something needing
to be suppressed, controlled, or bracketed. For Dewey, emotion is
courses through individuals (reasoning, acting) and social groups
(creating cultural meanings). He connects the traditional
balkanization of emotion to non-philosophical motives, such as the
segregation of leisure from labor and men from women. On Dewey&rsquo;s
reading, traditional rationalistic approaches require not just logical
but moral critique.</p>

<h3 id="SentMindCons">2.7 Sentiency, Mind, and Consciousness</h3>

<p>
Dewey&rsquo;s accounts of sentiency, mind, and consciousness build
upon those of impulse, perception, act, habit, and emotion. A cursory
view completes this sketch of Dewey&rsquo;s psychology.</p>

<h4 id="Sent">Sentiency</h4>

<p>
As with other psychic phenomena, sentience emerges through
organism-environment transactions. Creatures seek to satisfy needs and
escape peril; when precarity disrupts stability a struggle to
reestablish balance begins, and what follows is adjustment of self,
environment, or both. Sometimes previously successful methods
(pre-organized responses) fail, and we become ambivalent. Divided
against ourselves about what to do next, it proves advantageous to
<em>inhibit</em> practiced responses (look before leaping). It is this
inhibitory pause of action that, Dewey wrote, &ldquo;introduces mental
confusion, but also, in need for redirection, opportunity for
observation, recollection, anticipation&rdquo; (<em>EN</em>, LW1:
237). In other words, inhibition makes new ways of considering
alternatives possible, imbuing crude, physical situations with new
meaning. Thus, Dewey wrote, sentiency or feeling</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
is in general a name for the newly actualized quality acquired by
events previously occurring upon a physical level, when these events
come into more extensive and delicate relationships of interaction.
(<em>EN</em>, LW1: 204)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
At this stage, the new relationships are not yet <em>known</em>; they
do, however, provide the conditions for knowing. Symbolization,
language, liberates these now-noticed relationships using tools of
abstraction, memory, and imagination (<em>EN</em>, LW1: 199).</p>

<h4 id="Mind">Mind</h4>

<p>
Dewey rejected traditional accounts of mind-as-substance (or
container) and more contemporary reductions of mind to brain states
(<em>EN</em>, LW1: 224&ndash;225). Rather, mind is activity, a range
of dynamic processes of interaction between organism and world.
Language offers some clues to the diversity of ways we can think of
mind: as <em>memory</em> (I am re<em>mind</em>ed of X); as
<em>attention</em> (I keep her in <em>mind</em>, I <em>mind</em> my
manners); as <em>purpose</em> (I have an aim in <em>mind</em>); as
<em>care</em> or <em>solicitude</em> (I <em>mind</em> the child); as
<em>heed</em> (I <em>mind</em> the traffic stop). &ldquo;Mind&rdquo;,
then, ranges over many activities: intellectual, affectional,
volitional, or purposeful. It is</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
primarily a verb&hellip;[that] denotes every mode and variety of
interest in, and concern for, things: practical, intellectual, and
emotional. It never denotes anything self-contained, isolated from the
world of persons and things, but is always used with respect to
situations, events, objects, persons and groups. (<em>AE</em>, LW10:
267&ndash;68)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As Wittgenstein
 (<a href="../wittgenstein/#RuleFollPrivLang">entry on Wittgenstein, section on rule-following and private language</a>)
 pointed out 30 years later, no private language (see
 <a href="../private-language/">entry on private language</a>)
 is possible given this account of meaning. While meanings might be
privately entertained, they are not privately invented; meanings are
social and emerge from symbol systems arising through collective
communication and action (<em>EN</em>, LW1: 147).</p>

<p>
Active, complex animals are sentient due to the variety of distinctive
connections they have with their environment. But
&ldquo;mentality&rdquo; (mindfulness) arises due to the eventual
ability to recognize and use meaningful signs. With language,
creatures can identify and differentiate feelings <em>as</em>
feelings, objects <em>as</em> objects, etc.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Without language, the qualities of organic action that are feelings
are pains, pleasures, odors, colors, noises, tones, only potentially
and proleptically. With language they are discriminated and
identified. They are then &ldquo;objectified&rdquo;; they are
immediate traits of things. (<em>EN</em>, LW1: 198)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The bull&rsquo;s charge is <em>stimulated</em> by the red flag, but
the automobile driver <em>takes</em> the red stoplight <em>as</em> a
sign.</p>

<p>
Dewey thus de-divinized mind while accentuating new aspects of
mind&rsquo;s significance. No longer our spark of divinity, as some
ancients held, mind is also no mere ghost in a machine. Mind is
<em>vital</em>, investigating problems and inventing tools, aims, and
ideals. Mind bridges past and future, an &ldquo;agency of novel
reconstruction of a pre- existing order&rdquo; (<em>EN</em>, LW1:
168).</p>

<h4 id="Cons">Consciousness</h4>

<p>
Like mind, consciousness is also activity&mdash;the brisk
transitioning of felt, qualitative events. Profoundly influenced by
James&rsquo;s metaphor of consciousness as a constantly moving
&ldquo;stream of thought&rdquo; (<em>FAE</em>, LW5: 157), Dewey did
not conclude that an account of consciousness could be adequately
captured in words. Talk about consciousness is always
elliptical&mdash;it is &ldquo;vivid&rdquo; or
&ldquo;conspicuous&rdquo; or &ldquo;dull&rdquo;&mdash;always falling
shy of the phenomenon. Because the experience of consciousness is
ever-evanescent, we cannot fix it as with objects of our
attention&mdash; for example, &ldquo;powers&rdquo;,
&ldquo;things&rdquo;, or &ldquo;causes&rdquo;. Dewey, then, evokes but
does not define consciousness. Consider these contrasts in
<em>Experience and Nature</em>, (<em>EN</em>, LW1: 230)</p>

<table class="avoid-break cellpad-small hrules vert-top">

<p>
As the comparison makes obvious, psychological life is processual and
active; accordingly, Dewey describes consciousness in terms suiting
dynamic organisms. Consciousness is thinking-in-motion,
ever-reconfiguring series of events that are felt as qualitative
experience proceeds. If mind is a &ldquo;stock&rdquo; of meanings,
consciousness is the realization-and-reconstruction of meanings,
reconstructions which can reorganize and redirect activity
(<em>EN</em>, LW1: 233).</p>

<p>
Dewey occasionally tried to convey his notion of consciousness
performatively, inviting readers to reflect about consciousness while
they were reading about it. Here, again, &ldquo;focus&rdquo; and
&ldquo;fringe&rdquo; play a crucial role. (<em>EN</em>, LW1: 231). As
physical balance controls walking, mental meanings adjust and direct
ongoing foci and interpretation.</p>

<h2 id="ExpeMeta">3. Experience and Metaphysics</h2>

<h3 id="DeveExpe">3.1 The Development of &ldquo;Experience&rdquo;</h3>

<p>
Dewey&rsquo;s notion of &ldquo;experience&rdquo; evolved over the
course of his career. Initially, it contributed to his idealism and
psychology. After he developed instrumentalism in Chicago during the
1890&rsquo;s, Dewey moved to Columbia, revising and expanding the
concept in 1905 with his historically significant &ldquo;The Postulate
of Immediate Empiricism&rdquo; (<em>PIE</em>, MW3). &ldquo;The
Subject-matter of Metaphysical Inquiry&rdquo; (1915, MW8) and the
&ldquo;Introduction&rdquo; to <em>Essays in Experimental Logic</em>
(1916, MW10) developed the concept, showing &ldquo;experience&rdquo;
did more than rebut subjectivism in psychology, but was also central
to his metaphysical accounts of existence and nature (Dykhuizen 1973:
175&ndash;76). This was concretized in Dewey&rsquo;s 1923 Carus
Lectures, revised and expanded as <em>Experience and Nature</em>
(1925, revised edition, 1929; <em>EN</em>, LW1). Further extensions
and elaborations followed, notably in <em>Art as Experience</em>
(1934b, <em>AE</em>,
 LW10).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Pivotal to his oeuvre, interested readers should track experience
across this entry; here, the focus will be on Dewey&rsquo;s
philosophical method and metaphysics.</p>

<p>
Why was experience so important that it permeated Dewey&rsquo;s
approach to philosophy? Three influences were paramount. First, Dewey
inherited Darwin&rsquo;s idea of nature as a complex congeries of
changing, transactional processes without fixed ends; in this context,
experience means the undergoing and doing of
organisms-in-environments, &ldquo;a matter of functions and habits, of
active adjustments and readjustments, of coordinations and activities,
rather than of states of consciousness&rdquo; (&ldquo;A Short
Catechism Concerning Truth&rdquo;, MW6: 5). Second, Dewey took from
James a radically empirical approach to philosophy&mdash;the
insistence that perspectival experience, (e.g., the <em>personal</em>,
<em>emotional</em>, or <em>temperamental</em>) was philosophically
relevant, including to abstract and logical theories. Finally, Dewey
accepted Hegel&rsquo;s emphasis on experience beyond the subjective
consciousness &mdash; manifest in social, historical, and cultural
modes. The self is constituted through experiential transactions with
the community, and this vitiates the Cartesian model of simple, atomic
selves (and any methods based upon that presumption). Understood this
way, philosophy starts where <em>we</em> start, <em>personally
&mdash;</em> with complex, symbolic, and cultural forms.</p>

<p>
These influences, plus Dewey&rsquo;s own inquiries, convinced him
&ldquo;experience&rdquo; was the linch-pin to a broader theory of
human beings and the natural world. This renewed focus on experience
also amounted to a metaphilosophy; it discarded the assumption that
philosophy gave special insights into ultimate truth or reality.
Philosophy was equipment for living.</p>

<p>
As both sheer terminology and as Dewey deployed it,
&ldquo;experience&rdquo; generated much confusion and debate. Dewey
commented about this toward the end of his
 life.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup>
 Decades later, one of Dewey&rsquo;s foremost philosophical
celebrants, Richard Rorty, lambasted Dewey for both the term and (what
Rorty perceived as) Dewey&rsquo;s
 intentions.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>
 (Rorty 1977, 1995, 2006) (Rorty 1977, 1995, 2006) Nevertheless, since
the term lives on, both in Dewey&rsquo;s work and in everyday
discourse, it deserves continued analysis.</p>

<h3 id="TradViewExpeDeweCrit">3.2 Traditional Views of Experience and Dewey&rsquo;s Critique</h3>

<p>
Understanding Dewey&rsquo;s view of experience requires, first, some
notion of what he rejected. It was typical for many philosophers to
construe experience narrowly, as the private contents of
consciousness. These might be perceptions (sensing), or reflections
(calculating, associating, imagining) done by the subjective mind.
Some, such as Plato and Descartes, denigrated experience as a flux
which confused or diverted rational inquiry. Others, such as Hume and
Locke, thought experience (as atomic sensations) provided the mind at
least <em>some</em> resources for knowing, but with limits. All agreed
that <em>percepts</em> and <em>concepts</em> were different and in
tension; they agreed that sensation was perspectival and
context-relative; they also agreed that this relativity problematized
the assumed mission of philosophy&mdash;to <em>know</em> with
certainty&mdash;and differed only about the degree of the problem.</p>

<p>
Dewey disputed the empiricist conviction that sensations are
categorically separable contents of consciousness. This belief
produced a &ldquo;whole epistemological industry&rdquo; devoted to the
general problem of &ldquo;correspondence&rdquo; and a host of specific
puzzles (about the existence of an external world, other minds, free
will, etc.) (&ldquo;Propositions, Warranted Assertibility, and
Truth&rdquo;, LW14: 179). This &ldquo;industry&rdquo; isolates
philosophy from empirically informed accounts of experience and from
pressing, practical problems. Regarding mental privacy, Dewey argued
that while we have episodes of what might be called mental
interiority, it is a later development: &ldquo;Personality, selfhood,
subjectivity, are eventual functions that emerge with complexly
organized interactions, organic and social&rdquo; (<em>EN</em>, LW1:
162; see also 178&ndash;79). Regarding sensorial atomicity, discussed
previously in the
 <a href="#Psyc">section on psychology</a>,</p>
 
<p>
Dewey explained sensation as embedded in a larger sensori-motor
circuit, a transaction which should not be quarantined to any single
phase&mdash;nor to consciousness.</p>

<p>
Dewey levied similar criticisms against traditional accounts of
reflective thought. He denied a substantial view of mind, especially
one ontological apart from body, history, or culture. Reasoning is one
function of mind, not the exercise of a separate
&ldquo;faculty&rdquo;. There is no reason to purify reasoning of
feeling, either; reasoning is always permeated with feelings and
practical exigencies. It may be practical, at times to &ldquo;bracket
out&rdquo; a feeling or exigency when they interfere with mental
calculating, but it is nevertheless true that reasoning subsists in a
wider and &ldquo;qualitative world&rdquo; (&ldquo;Psychology and
Work&rdquo;, LW5: 243).</p>

<h3 id="DewePosiAccoExpe">3.3 Dewey&rsquo;s Positive Account of Experience</h3>

<p>
We have, already, an outline of Dewey&rsquo;s view: experience is
processual, transactional, socially mediated, and not categorically
prefigured as &ldquo;rational&rdquo; or &ldquo;emotional&rdquo;. We
add three additional, positive characterizations of experience: first,
as <em>experimental</em>; second, as <em>primary</em>
(&ldquo;had&rdquo;) or <em>secondary</em> (&ldquo;known&rdquo;); and
third, as <em>methodological</em>.</p>

<p>
First, experience exhibits a fundamentally experimental character.
Dewey&rsquo;s saw, during decades in education, how children&rsquo;s
experiences alternate between acting and being acted upon. Such phases
become &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; when agents (students) consciously
relate what is tried with what eventuates as they come to understand
which actions are significant for controlling future events. When
experience is experimental, we name the outcome
 &ldquo;learning&rdquo;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Second, most of experience is not known or reflective; it is barely
regulated or reflected upon. As such, it is &ldquo;felt&rdquo; or
&ldquo;had&rdquo;. Dewey also calls such experience direct and
primary. The other kind experience, the focus of philosophy, is
characterized by &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; or mediation-by-reflection.
Dewey labels these &ldquo;indirect&rdquo;, &ldquo;secondary&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;known&rdquo;. <em>Known</em> experience abstracts from
<em>had</em> (or direct) experience purposefully and selectively,
isolating certain relations or connections. <em>The Quest for
Certainty</em> provides a cogent description:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[E]xperienced situations come about in two ways and are of two
distinct types. Some take place with only a minimum of regulation,
with little foresight, preparation and intent. Others occur because,
in part, of the prior occurrence of intelligent action. Both kinds are
<em>had</em>; they are undergone, enjoyed or suffered. The first are
not known; they are not understood; they are dispensations of fortune
or providence. The second have, as they are experienced, meanings that
present the funded outcome of operations that substitute definite
continuity for experienced discontinuity and for the fragmentary
quality due to isolation. (<em>QC</em>, LW4:
 194)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup></p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
Dewey&rsquo;s had/known distinction describes existence without
presupposing a dualism between appearance/reality. Much can be unknown
without therefore being illusory or merely apparent. <em>Pace</em>
Plato, we are not trapped in a cave of illusions with reason as our
only escape. We cope with a world that is often confusing or opaque;
as we try to make meaning, we keep track of ideas especially helpful
predicting and controlling circumstances. Some other experiences are
simply enjoyed without making them less <em>real</em>.</p>

<p>
Third, Dewey&rsquo;s renewed and expanded focus on experience was
methodological. This requires some unpacking. Dewey&rsquo;s
distinction between experience &ldquo;had&rdquo; and
&ldquo;known&rdquo; was more than a phenomenological observation; it
was directive about how philosophy should be done. (We can see this
kind of move embedded in Peirce&rsquo;s pragmatic maxim and
James&rsquo;s radical empiricism.) For Dewey, experience is not just
&ldquo;stuff&rdquo; presented to (or witnessed by) consciousness;
experience is activity, engagement with life. Philosophy, too, is a
form of lived activity, which means that doing philosophy properly
requires a different starting point. In life, even philosophers do not
<em>start</em> with a theory. Theories undoubtedly enter in, but not
first. &ldquo;The vine of pendant theory&rdquo;, Dewey wrote about the
denotative method, &ldquo;is attached at both ends to the pillars of
observed subject-matter&rdquo; (<em>EN</em>, LW1: 11; see also
 386).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Following James and Peirce, Dewey is challenging the theoretical
assumptions of previous philosophies&mdash;&ldquo;substances&rdquo;,
&ldquo;mind vs. body&rdquo;, &ldquo;pleasure as natural aim&rdquo;,
and so on. Dewey&rsquo;s philosophical work did critique those
concepts, but the point here is metaphilosophical&mdash;that we do not
start with what is abstract, conceptual. Dewey&rsquo;s concern with
such theoretical starting points was that they isolate philosophy from
a more thoroughgoing empiricism capable of engaging actual human
problems.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Experience as method&rdquo;, then, is both a warning and a
positive recommendation. It warns philosophers to recognize that while
intellectual terms may <em>seem</em> &ldquo;original, primitive and
simple&rdquo; they should be understood as the historically and
normatively situated &ldquo;products of discrimination and
classification&rdquo; (<em>EN</em>, LW1: 386; see also 371&ndash;372,
375). &ldquo;Knowing&rdquo; does not stand beyond experience or
nature, but is an activity with its own standpoint and qualitative
character. <em>Whatever</em> theory is eventually devised, a genuinely
experiential method will check it against ordinary experience
(<em>EN</em>, LW1:
 26).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup></p>
 
<blockquote>

<p>
The experiential or denotative method tells us that we must go behind
the refinements and elaborations of reflective experience to the gross
and compulsory things of our doings, enjoyments and
sufferings&mdash;to the things that force us to labor, that satisfy
needs, that surprise us with beauty, that compel obedience under
penalty. (<em>EN</em>, LW1: 375&ndash;76)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Such a method is <em>critical</em> because it forces inquirers to
check previous interpretations and judgments against their live
encounters in a new situation (<em>EN</em>, LW1: 364). Philosophy has
to engage with new subject matters (and theories), accept challenges
beyond the traditional &ldquo;problems of philosophy&rdquo;, and
embrace the idea that &ldquo;the starting point is the actually
<em>problematic</em>&rdquo; (<em>EN</em>, LW1: 61).</p>

<h3 id="Meta">3.4 Metaphysics</h3>

<p>
Much that is central to Dewey&rsquo;s metaphysics has been
discussed&mdash;the transactional organism-environment setting, mind,
consciousness, and experience. Accordingly, this section will examine
how Dewey conceived of &ldquo;metaphysics&rdquo;, the main project in
<em>Experience and Nature</em>, how he attempted to reconnect
empirical metaphysics with an ancient idea (philosophy as wisdom), and
some of the criticisms his conception received.</p>

<h3 id="DeveMeta">3.5 The Development of &ldquo;Metaphysics&rdquo;</h3>

<p>
Debate over a definite meaning for the term &ldquo;metaphysics&rdquo;,
was as alive in Dewey&rsquo;s day as in ours. From the beginning,
Dewey sought to critique and reconstruct metaphysical concepts (e.g.,
reality, self, consciousness, time, necessity, and individuality) and
systems (e.g., Spinoza, Leibniz, Kant, and Hegel). Like his fellow
pragmatists Peirce, James, and Mead, Dewey wished to transform not
eradicate metaphysics. Dewey&rsquo;s early metaphysical views were
closest to idealism, but engagements with experimental science and
instrumentalism convinced him to abandon the traditional goal of
ultimate and complete accounts of reality.</p>

<p>
His interest in metaphysics was revivified at Columbia by colleague F.
J. E. Woodbridge, who thought metaphysics could be done in a
&ldquo;descriptive&rdquo; rather than an extra-physical way
(&ldquo;Biography of John Dewey&rdquo;, in Schilpp 1939: 36). While
many of Dewey&rsquo;s most important metaphysical works focused on
experience (discussed above), special attention is due to &ldquo;The
Postulate of Immediate Empiricism&rdquo; (1905, <em>PIE</em>, MW3),
&ldquo;The Subject-Matter of Metaphysical Inquiry&rdquo; (1915, MW8),
and his &ldquo;Introduction&rdquo; to <em>Essays in Experimental
Logic</em> (1916c,
 MW10).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup>
 These were all vital precursors to his magnum opus, <em>Experience
and Nature</em>. <em>EN</em>&rsquo;s final chapters, dealing with art
and consummatory experience, were further developed in <em>Art as
Experience</em> (1934b, LW10), a text containing additional and
significant metaphysical discussions.</p>

<p>
While labels tend to obscure what was innovative in his work, it is
safe to say Dewey composed a realist, naturalistic, non-reductive,
emergentist, process
 metaphysics.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-16" id="ref-16">16</a>]</sup>
 He described nature&rsquo;s most general features (&ldquo;generic
traits&rdquo;) while trying to do empirical justice to the world as
encountered. His account also aimed to remain fallible and useful for
future researchers seeking to improve life with philosophy. In the
end, Dewey described his efforts as a &ldquo;metaphysics&rdquo; and as
a &ldquo;system&rdquo;: &ldquo;the hanging together of various
problems and various hypotheses in a perspective&rdquo; (&ldquo;Nature
in Experience&rdquo;, LW14: 141&ndash;142). He did not propose a
metaphysics from a god&rsquo;s eye point of view, but one informed and
motivated by &ldquo;a definite point of view&rdquo; and linked to the
contemporary, human world (&ldquo;Half-hearted Naturalism&rdquo;, LW3:
75&ndash;76 ).</p>

<h3 id="ProjExpeNatu">3.6 The Project of <em>Experience and Nature</em></h3>

<p>
<em>Experience and Nature</em> provides extended criticism of past
metaphysical approaches, especially their quest for certainty and
assumption of an Appearance/Reality framework, and a positive, general
theory regarding how human existence is situated in nature. It is
empirical, descriptive, and hypothetical, eschewing claims of special
access beyond &ldquo;experience in unsophisticated forms&rdquo;. Such
experience, Dewey argued, gives us &ldquo;evidence of a different
world and points to a different metaphysics&rdquo; (<em>EN</em>, LW1:
47). <em>EN</em> looks to existing characteristics of human culture,
anthropologically, to see what they reveal, more generally, about
nature. One significant product is Dewey&rsquo;s isolation, analysis,
and description of &ldquo;generic traits of existence&rdquo; and their
relations to one another.</p>

<p>
While this entry lacks space for even a bare summary, it is noteworthy
that <em>EN</em> begins with an extensive discussion of method and
experience as a new starting point for philosophy. An extensive
presentation of the generic traits follows, which later informs
discussions about science, technology, body, mind, language, art, and
value. While the traits are not presented systematically (&agrave; la
other metaphysicians such as Spinoza or Whitehead) there is a
progression moving from the more basic to the more
 complex.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-17" id="ref-17">17</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="EmpiMetaWisd">3.7 Empirical Metaphysics and Wisdom</h3>

<p>
One might ask, How can metaphysics contribute to the world beyond
academic philosophy? Dewey aimed to return philosophy to an older,
ancient mission&mdash;the pursuit of wisdom. And while Dewey describes
philosophy as inherently critical, a &ldquo;criticism of
criticisms&rdquo;, it still raises questions about the objectives of
an empirical, hypothetical, naturalistic metaphysics? (<em>EN</em>,
LW1: 298) Dewey raises the issue, himself, prophylactically:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
As a statement of the generic traits manifested by existences of all
kinds without regard to their differentiation into physical and
mental, [metaphysics] seems to have nothing to do with criticism and
choice, with an effective love of wisdom. (<em>EN</em>, LW1: 308)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
His answer comes by way of an account of existence&rsquo;s generic
traits, which purportedly provides &ldquo;a ground-map of the province
of criticism, establishing base lines to be employed in more intricate
triangulations&rdquo; (<em>EN</em>, LW1:
 308).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-18" id="ref-18">18</a>]</sup>
 A new metaphysics, like a new map, offers new possibilities for
framing and explaining the world. This could discredit entrenched
truisms&mdash;e.g., men are rational, women are emotional, humans are
intelligent, animals are dumb, etc.&mdash; or facilitate new
connections and new meanings. As Dewey saw it, the long tradition of
philosophy had rendered too basic conceptual tools (kinds, categories,
dualisms, aims, and values) unassailable; his reconsideration offered
a new basis for metaphysics, one which would be relevant and
revisable.</p>

<p>
"Map-making" suggested a new way to do metaphysics and a new role for
philosophers. Philosophers, on this model, become &ldquo;liaison
officers&rdquo;, intermediators able to facilitate communication
between those speaking at cross purposes or in different jargons
(<em>EN</em>, LW1: 306). Drawing from contemporary circumstances and
purposes, the maps drawn could not promise certainty or permanency but
would need to be redrawn according to changing needs and purposes.
Their test, as with the rest of Dewey&rsquo;s pragmatist philosophy,
would lay in their capacity to sharpen criticisms and secure
values.</p>

<h3 id="CritDeweMeta">3.8 Criticisms of Dewey&rsquo;s Metaphysics</h3>

<p>
Dewey received and responded to many criticisms of his metaphysical
views. Critics often overlooked that his aim was to undercut
prevailing metaphysical genres; often, his view was rashly consigned
to some other extant camp. (He was characterized, variously, as a
realist, idealist, relativist, subjectivist, etc. See Hildebrand
2003.) One recurrent criticism was that his statement in <em>PIE</em>
(that &ldquo;things are what they are experienced as&rdquo; ) could
not yield a metaphysics because it merely reported subjective and
immediate experience; such reports, the criticism went, prevented a
more mediated and (properly) objective account. Twenty years later,
<em>EN</em> received similar reactions by critics who attacked
Dewey&rsquo;s non-binary approach to experience <em>and</em>
 nature.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-19" id="ref-19">19</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Subsequent criticisms focused upon Dewey&rsquo;s supposed neglect of a
tension between &ldquo;qualities&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;relations&rdquo;.
Qualities, the argument ran, are immediate, whereas relations are
mediate; how could Dewey claim they coexist in the same item of
experience? This seemed to embody a
 contradiction.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-20" id="ref-20">20</a>]</sup>
 Richard Bernstein (1961) seized on this issue, and claimed that Dewey
harbored two irreconcilable strains, a &ldquo;metaphysical
strain&rdquo; and a &ldquo;phenomenological strain&rdquo;, but failed
to sufficiently account for them with his &ldquo;principle of
continuity&rdquo;. One response to Bernstein argued that his critique
unwittingly reenacted the very spectatorial standpoint Dewey&rsquo;s
experiential starting point seeking to
 overcome.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-21" id="ref-21">21</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
In recent years, some debate whether Dewey should have engaged in
metaphysics at all. Richard Rorty and Charlene Haddock Seigfried
argued that Dewey&rsquo;s critique of traditional metaphysics was as
far as he should have gone; his further efforts diverted him from more
important ethical work (Seigfried 2001a, 2004) or plunged him into
foundationalist projects previously disavowed (&ldquo;Dewey&rsquo;s
Metaphysics&rdquo; in Rorty 1977). Defenders argue that Dewey&rsquo;s
genuinely new approach to metaphysics avoids old problems while
contributing something salutary to culture at large (Myers 2020,
Garrison 2005, Boisvert 1998a, Alexander 2020).</p>

<h2 id="InquKnow">4. Inquiry and Knowledge</h2>

<h3 id="OrgaRootInst">4.1 The Organic Roots of Instrumentalism</h3>

<p>
The interactional, organic model Dewey developed in his psychology
informed his theories of learning and knowledge. Within this
framework, a range of traditional epistemological proposals and
puzzles (premised on metaphysical divisions such as
appearance/reality, mind/world) lost credibility. &ldquo;So far as the
question of the relation of the self to known objects is
concerned&rdquo;, Dewey wrote, &ldquo;knowing is but one special case
of the agent-patient, of the behaver-enjoyer-sufferer situation&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Brief Studies in Realism&rdquo;, MW6: 120). As with
psychology, Dewey&rsquo;s wholesale repudiation of the traditional
metaphysical framework required extensive reconstruction in every
other area; &ldquo;instrumentalism&rdquo; was one popular name for
Dewey&rsquo;s reconstruction of epistemology (or &ldquo;theory of
inquiry&rdquo;, as Dewey
 preferred).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-22" id="ref-22">22</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
As with his earlier functional approach to psychology, Dewey&rsquo;s
instrumentalism leveraged Darwin to dissolve entrenched divisions
between, for example, realism/idealism, science/religion, and
empiricism/rationalism. Change and transformation become natural
features of the actual world, and knowledge and logic are recast as
ways to adapt, survive, and thrive. The better way to understand
reasoning is by looking to the dynamic and biological world which
harbors it, rather than the traditional paradigms of static precision,
physics or
 mathematics.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-23" id="ref-23">23</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Early statements of instrumentalism (and definitive breaks by Dewey
with Hegelian logic) may be seen in &ldquo;Some Stages of Logical
Thought&rdquo; (Dewey 1900 [1916], MW1); that essay follows Peirce
 (<a href="../peirce/#prag">entry on Peirce section on pragmatism, pragmaticism, and the scientific method</a>],<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-24" id="ref-24">24</a>]</sup>
 especially the well known 1877&ndash;78 articles championing the
larger framework of scientific thinking, namely the
&ldquo;doubt-inquiry process&rdquo; (MW1: 173; see also Peirce 1877,
1878). This account is developed in <em>Studies in Logical Theory</em>
(Dewey 1903b, MW2), by Dewey and his collaborators at Chicago. In the
work, Dewey acknowledges a &ldquo;preeminent obligation&rdquo; to
James (Perry 1935:
 308&ndash;309).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-25" id="ref-25">25</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
<em>Studies</em> criticizes transcendentalist logic extensively,
concluding that logic should not assume either thought or
reality&rsquo;s existence <em>in general</em> but should rest content
with the function or use of ideas <em>in experience</em>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The test of validity of [an] idea is its functional or instrumental
use in effecting the transition from a relatively conflicting
experience to a relatively integrated one. (<em>Studies</em>, MW2:
359)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, instrumentalism abandons all psycho-physical dualisms and all
correspondentist theories of knowing. Dewey wrote,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In the logical process the datum is not just external existence, and
the idea mere psychical existence. Both are modes of
existence&mdash;one of <em>given</em> existence, the other of
<em>possible</em>, of inferred existence&hellip;.In other words, datum
and ideatum are divisions of labor, cooperative instrumentalities, for
economical dealing with the problem of the maintenance of the
integrity of experience. (<em>Studies</em>, MW2: 339&ndash;340)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="BeyoEmpiRatiKant">4.2 Beyond Empiricism, Rationalism, and Kant</h3>

<p>
While instrumentalism was of a piece with Dewey&rsquo;s other views,
it was also responding to dialectic within philosophy&rsquo;s
epistemological positions, particularly between British empiricism,
rationalism (see entry on
 <a href="../rationalism-empiricism/">rationalism vs. empiricism</a>),
 and the Kantian synthesis.</p>

<p>
Classical empiricists insisted that sensory experience provided the
origins of knowledge. They were motivated, in part, by the concern
that rationalistic accounts effort to link knowledge with thought
alone (away from particular sense stimuli), were too unchecked.
Without the constraints of sense experience, philosophy was doomed to
keep producing wildly divergent systems. Classical empiricists, like
Dewey, shared a genuine interest in scientific progress; such progress
required, first, escape from unfettered speculation. The account
developed by figures such as Locke, Berkeley, and Hume claimed that
(in Locke&rsquo;s version) the world writes on a receptive blank
slate, the mind, in the language of ideas. Using faculties of memory,
association, and imagination, knowledge is generated; extension of
knowledge must, on this account, be traceable to origination in sense
experience.</p>

<p>
Rationalists, in contrast, argued that knowledge was both abstract and
deductively certain. Sensory experiences are fluid, individualized,
and permeated by the relativity borne of innumerable external
conditions. How could a philosophical account of <em>genuine</em>
knowledge&mdash;necessarily certain, self-evident, and
unchanging&mdash;be derived using sensorial flux? No, knowledge must
be derived from inner and certain concepts. Knowledge, then, is
produced by an immaterial entity, mind, with an innate power to
reason, independent of the contingencies of practical ends and
physical bodies.</p>

<p>
Kant responded to the empiricist-rationalist tension by reigning in
their ambitions; philosophy must stop attempting to transcend the
limits of thought and experience. Philosophy&rsquo;s more modest and
proper aspiration is to discover what can be known in the phenomenal
world. Kant, then, refused an originary role to either percepts or
concepts, arguing that sense and reason are co-constitutive of
knowledge. More important, Kant argued for mind as systematizing and
constructive.</p>

<p>
Dewey&rsquo;s response to this three-way epistemological conflict was
foreshadowed in the earlier discussion of the &ldquo;Reflex Arc&rdquo;
paper and the idea of sensori-motor circuits. For Dewey, any proposal
premised on a disconnected mind and body&mdash;or upon one assuming
that stimuli (causes, impressions, or what have you) were atomic and
in need of synthesis&mdash;was a
 non-starter.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-26" id="ref-26">26</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Accepting some of Kant&rsquo;s criticisms of rationalism and
empiricism, Dewey rejected Kant&rsquo;s propagation of several
significant but unjustified assumptions: that knowledge must be
certain; that nature and intellect were categorically distinct; and
that it was justified to posit a noumenal realm
(things-in-themselves). Dewey also questioned Kant&rsquo;s supposition
that the sensations ingredient to knowledge are initially inchoate;
such a claim was, Dewey believed, driven by Kant&rsquo;s
architectonic. Methodologically, perhaps most significantly, Dewey
followed James in criticizing Kant&rsquo;s standpoint as too
spectatorial. From a pragmatic, Jamesean, &ldquo;radical
empiricist&rdquo; standpoint, one may accept a wide variety of
phenomenon (clear, vague, felt, remembered, anticipated, etc.) as
<em>real</em> even though they are not <em>known</em>.</p>

<p>
Thus, for Dewey, Kant falls short of the philosophical perspective
needed to synthesize perception and conception, nature and reason,
practice and theory. While Kant&rsquo;s model of an active and
structuring mind was a clear advance over passive ones, it retained
the retrograde picture of knowledge as reality&rsquo;s faithful
mirror. Kant failed to see <em>knowledge as a dynamic instrument</em>
for managing (predicting, controlling, guiding) <em>future</em>
experience. This pragmatic conception of knowledge judges it as one
would an eye or hand, gauging how it affects the organism&rsquo;s
ability to cope:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
What measures [knowledge&rsquo;s] value, its correctness and truth, is
the degree of its availability for conducting to a successful issue
the activities of living beings. (&ldquo;The Bearings of Pragmatism
Upon Education&rdquo;, in MW4: 180)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, Dewey replaced Kant&rsquo;s mind-centered system with one
centered upon experience-nature transactions&mdash;&ldquo;a
reversal&rdquo;, Dewey wrote, &ldquo;comparable to a Copernican
revolution&rdquo; (<em>QC</em>, LW4: 232).</p>

<h3 id="InquKnowTrut">4.3 Inquiry, Knowledge, and Truth</h3>

<p>
In the context of instrumentalism, what is &ldquo;logic&rdquo; and
&ldquo;epistemology&rdquo;? Dewey does not discard these but insists
on a more empirical approach. How do reasoning and learning actually
 happen?<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-27" id="ref-27">27</a>]</sup>
 Dewey comprehensively addresses logic in his 1938 <em>Logic: The
Theory of Inquiry</em> (<em>LTI</em>, LW12), which calls logic the
&ldquo;inquiry into inquiry&rdquo;. <em>LTI</em> attempts to
systematically collect, organize, and explicate the actual conditions
of different kinds of inquiry; the aim, previewed in his 1917
&ldquo;The Need for a Recovery of Philosophy&rdquo;, is pragmatic and
ameliorative: to provide an &ldquo;important aid in proper guidance of
further attempts at knowing&rdquo; (MW10: 23).</p>

<p>
Throughout his career, Dewey described the processes and patterns
evinced in active problem solving. Here, we consider three: inquiry,
knowledge, and truth. There is, Dewey argued, a &ldquo;pattern of
inquiry&rdquo; which prevails in problem solving. &ldquo;Analysis of
Reflective Thinking&rdquo; (1933, LW8) and <em>LTI</em> (LW12)
describes five phases. Disavowing the usual divide between emotion and
reason, inquiry begins (1) with a <em>feeling</em> of something amiss,
a unique and particular doubtfulness; this feeling endures as a
pervasive quality imbued in inquiry and serves as a kind of
&ldquo;guide&rdquo; to subsequent phases. Next, because what is
initially present is indeterminate, (2) a <em>problem</em> must be
specifically formulated; note that problems do not preexist inquiry,
as typically
 assumed.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-28" id="ref-28">28</a>]</sup>
 Next, (3) a <em>hypothesis</em> is constructed, one which
imaginatively utilizes both theoretical ideas and perceptual facts in
order to forecast possible consequences of eventual operations. Next,
(4) one <em>reasons through</em> the meanings involved in the
hypothesis, estimating implications or possible contradictions;
frequently, discoveries here direct one return to an earlier phase (to
reformulate the hypothesis or redescribe the
 problem).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-29" id="ref-29">29</a>]</sup>
 Finally, inquiry closes, (5) acting to evaluate and test the
hypothesis; here, inquiry discovers whether a proposed solution
resolves the problem, whether (in <em>LTI</em>&rsquo;s terminology)
inquiry has converted an &ldquo;indeterminate situation&rdquo; into a
&ldquo;determinate one&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
The inquiry pattern Dewey sketched is schematic; actual cases of
reasoning often lack such discreteness or linearity. Thus, the pattern
is not a summary of how people <em>always</em> think but rather how
exemplary cases of inquirential thinking unfold (e.g., in the
empirical sciences).</p>

<p>
Knowledge, on Dewey&rsquo;s transactional model of inquiry, departs
from tradition and brought to earth. &ldquo;Knowledge, as an abstract
term&rdquo;, Dewey wrote,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
is a name for the product of competent inquiries. Apart from this
relation, its meaning is so empty that any content or filling may be
arbitrarily poured in. (<em>LTI</em>, LW12: 16)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To understand a product, one must understand the process; this is
Dewey&rsquo;s approach. By denying that knowledge is an isolated
product, he effectively denies a metaphysics that makes mind-
the-substance separate from everything else. He <em>does not
depreciate knowing as an activity</em>, and strongly maintains that
&ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; is crucial to mediating individual and
societal
 conflicts.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-30" id="ref-30">30</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Truth is also radically reevaluated. Truth long connoted an
ideal&mdash; an epistemic fixity (a correspondence, a coherence)
capable of satisfying the need for further inquiry. Since this is not
the actual situation human beings (or philosophy) inhabits, the ideal
should be set aside. Still, Dewey was ever the (re)constructivist; in
&ldquo;Experience, Knowledge, and Value&rdquo; (1939c) he provided an
account. Truth no longer points toward something transcendental but
toward the <em>process</em> of inquiry (&ldquo;Experience, Knowledge,
and Value&rdquo;, LW14: 56&ndash;57). A proposition is
&ldquo;true&rdquo; insofar as it serves as a reliable resource:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In scientific inquiry, the criterion of what is taken to be settled,
or to be knowledge, is being so settled that it is available as a
resource in further inquiry; not being settled in such a way as not to
be subject to revision in further inquiry. (<em>LTI</em>, LW12:
16)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Truth is not beyond experience, but is an experienced relation,
particularly one socially shared. In <em>How We Think</em>, Dewey
wrote,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Truth, in final analysis, is the statement of things &ldquo;as they
are,&rdquo; not as they are in the inane and desolate void of
isolation from human concern, but as they are in a shared and
progressive experience&hellip;.Truth, truthfulness, transparent and
brave publicity of intercourse, are the source and the reward of
friendship. Truth is having things in common. (<em>HWT</em>, MW6: 67;
see also &ldquo;The Experimental Theory of Knowledge&rdquo;, 1910b,
MW3: 118)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In Dewey&rsquo;s instrumentalism, then, knowledge and truth are
adjectival not nominative, describing a process which, as Peirce tells
us, can persist as long as we do. &ldquo;There is no belief so settled
as not to be exposed to further inquiry&rdquo; (LTI, LW12: 16). Words
like &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; and &ldquo;truth&rdquo; are honored
because of their historic service as tools for past inquiries and
their aid in securing values.</p>

<h2 id="PhilEduc">5. Philosophy of Education</h2>

<p>
Around the world, Dewey remains as well known for his educational
theories (see
 <a href="../education-philosophy/#RouDewProMov">entry on philosophy of education, section Rousseau, Dewey, and the progressive movement</a>)
 as for his philosophical ones. A closer look shows how often these
theories align. Recognizing this, Dewey reflected that his 1916 magnum
opus in education, <em>Democracy and Education</em> (<em>DE</em>, MW9)
&ldquo;was for many years that [work] in which my philosophy, such as
it is, was most fully expounded&rdquo; (<em>FAE</em>, LW5: 156).
<em>DE</em> argued that philosophy itself could be understood as
&ldquo;the general theory of education&rdquo;, avoiding further
hyper-specialization and investing more earnestly in everyday
problems.</p>

<p>
This was a call to see philosophy from an educational standpoint:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Education offers a vantage ground from which to penetrate to the
human, as distinct from the technical, significance of philosophic
discussions&hellip;.The educational point of view enables one to
envisage the philosophic problems where they arise and thrive, where
they are at home, and where acceptance or rejection makes a difference
in practice. If we are willing to conceive education as the process of
forming fundamental dispositions, intellectual and emotional, toward
nature and fellow-men, philosophy may even be defined <em>as the
general theory of education</em>. (<em>DE</em>, MW9: 338)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Dewey was active in education his entire life. Besides high school and
college teaching, he devised curricula, established, reviewed and
administered schools and departments of education, participated in
collective organizing, consulted and lectured internationally, and
wrote extensively on many facets of education. He established the
University of Chicago&rsquo;s Laboratory School as an experimental
site for theories in instrumental logic and psychological
functionalism. This school also became a site for democratic
expression by the local community.</p>

<h3 id="ExpeLearTeac">5.1 Experiential Learning and Teaching</h3>

<p>
Dewey&rsquo;s &ldquo;Reflex Arc&rdquo; paper applied functionalism to
education. &ldquo;Reflex&rdquo; argued that human experience is not a
disjointed sequence of fits and starts, but a developing circuit of
activities. Framed this way, learning is a cumulative, progressive
process where inquirers move from dissatisfying doubt toward
satisfying resolutions of problems. &ldquo;Reflex&rdquo; also shows
that the subject of a stimulus (e.g., the pupil) is not a passive
recipient but an agent actively <em>selecting</em> stimuli within a
larger field of activities.</p>

<p>
Cognizance of these facts, Dewey argued, compelled educators to
discard pedagogies based on the mind as &ldquo;blank slate&rdquo;. In
<em>The School and Society</em> Dewey wrote, &ldquo;the question of
education is the question of taking hold of [children&rsquo;s]
activities, of giving them direction&rdquo; (MW1: 25). <em>How We
Think</em> (1910c, MW6) primarily aimed to help teachers apply
instrumentalism. Overall, education&rsquo;s intellectual goals would
advance by acquainting children using the general intellectual habits
of scientific inquiry.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The native and unspoiled attitude of childhood, marked by ardent
curiosity, fertile imagination, and love of experimental inquiry, is
near, very near, to the attitude of the scientific mind.
(<em>HWT</em>, MW6: 179)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These proposals entailed the revision of the teacher&rsquo;s role;
while teachers still had to know their subject matter, they also
needed to understand students&rsquo; cultural and personal
backgrounds. If learning was to incorporate actual problems, more
careful integration of content with particular learners was needed.
Motivational tactics also had to change. Rather than rewards or
punishments, Deweyan teachers were to reimagine the whole learning
environment, merging the school&rsquo;s existing goals with
pupils&rsquo; present interests. One strategy was to identify specific
problems that could bridge curriculum and student and then formulate
learning situations to exercise
 them.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-31" id="ref-31">31</a>]</sup>
 This problem-centered approach was demanding, requiring teachers to
train in subject matters, child psychology, and pedagogies for weaving
these
 together.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-32" id="ref-32">32</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="TradRomaDewe">5.2 Traditionalists, Romantics, and Dewey</h3>

<p>
Dewey&rsquo;s educational philosophy emerged amidst a fierce
1890&rsquo;s debate between educational &ldquo;romantics&rdquo; and
&ldquo;traditionalists&rdquo;. <em>Romantics</em> (also called
&ldquo;New&rdquo; or &ldquo;Progressive&rdquo; education by Dewey),
urged a &ldquo;child- centered&rdquo; approach; the child&rsquo;s
natural impulses provided education&rsquo;s proper starting point.
Education should not fetter creativity and growth, even if content
must sometimes be attenuated. <em>Traditionalists</em> (called
&ldquo;Old&rdquo; education by Dewey) pressed for
&ldquo;curriculum-centered&rdquo; approaches. Children were empty
cabinets curriculum fills with civilization&rsquo;s contents; the main
job of instruction was to ensure receptivity with discipline.</p>

<p>
Dewey developed an interactional model to move beyond that debate,
refusing to privilege either child or society. (See &ldquo;My
Pedagogic Creed&rdquo;, 1897b, EW5; <em>The School and Society</em>,
1899, MW1; <em>Democracy and Education</em>, 1916b, MW9;
<em>Experience and Education</em>, 1938b, LW13, etc.) While Romantics
correctly identified the child (replete with instincts, powers,
habits, and histories) as an indispensable starting point for
pedagogy, Dewey denied that the child was the <em>only</em> starting
point. Larger social groups (family, community, nation) have a
legitimate stake in passing along extant interests, needs, and values
as part of an educational synthesis.</p>

<p>
Still, of these two approaches, Dewey more adamantly rejected
traditionalists&rsquo; (overly) high premium on discipline and
memorization. While recognizing the legitimacy of conveying content
(facts, values), it is paramount that schools eschew indoctrination.
Educating meant <em>incorporating</em>, giving wide latitude for
unique individuals who, after all, would inherit and have dominion
over the changing society. This is why <em>who the child was</em>
mattered so much. Following colleague and lifelong friend G.H.
Mead&rsquo;s ideas about the social self, Dewey argued that schools
had to become micro-communities to reflect children&rsquo;s growing
interests and needs. &ldquo;The school cannot be a preparation for
social life excepting as it reproduces, within itself, the typical
conditions of social life&rdquo; (&ldquo;Ethical Principles Underlying
Education&rdquo;, 1897a, EW5:
 61&ndash;62).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-33" id="ref-33">33</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="DemoThroEduc">5.3 Democracy Through Education</h3>

<p>
Connecting child, school, and society aimed not only to improve
pedagogy, but democracy as well. Because character, rights, and duties
are informed by and contribute to the social realm, schools were
critical sites to learn and experiment with democracy. Democratic life
includes not only civics and economics, but epistemic and
communicative habits as well: problem solving, compassionate
imagination, creative expression, and civic self-governance. The range
of roles a child might inhabit is vast; this creates a societal
obligation to make education its highest political and economic
priority. During WWII, Dewey wrote,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
There will be almost a revolution in school education when study and
learning are treated not as acquisition of what others know but as
development of capital to be invested in eager alertness in observing
and judging the conditions under which one lives. Yet until this
happens, we shall be ill-prepared to deal with a world whose
outstanding trait is change. (&ldquo;Between Two Worlds&rdquo;, 1944,
LW17: 463)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Democracy is much more comprehensive than a form of government, it is
&ldquo;not an alternative to other principles of associated life [but]
the idea of community life itself&rdquo; (<em>PP</em>, LW2: 328).
Individuals exist in communities; as their lives change, needs and
conflicts emerge that require intelligent management; we must make
sense out of new experiences. Education empowers that by teaching the
attitudes and habits (imaginative, empirical) that made the
experimental sciences so successful. Dewey called these attitudes and
habits
 &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-34" id="ref-34">34</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Informing these areas&mdash;science, education, and democratic
life&mdash;is Dewey&rsquo;s naturalism, which redirects hope away from
what is immutable or ultimate (God, Nature, Reason, Ends) toward the
human capacity to learn from experience. In &ldquo;Creative
Democracy&mdash;The Task Before Us&rdquo; (1939b) Dewey wrote,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Democracy is the faith that the process of experience is more
important than any special result attained, so that special results
achieved are of ultimate value only as they are used to enrich and
order the ongoing process. Since the process of experience is capable
of being educative, faith in democracy is all one with faith in
experience and education. All ends and values that are cut off from
the ongoing process become arrests, fixations. They strive to fixate
what has been gained instead of using it to open the road and point
the way to new and better experiences. (&ldquo;Creative
Democracy&rdquo;, LW14: 229)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Democracy&rsquo;s success or failure rests on education. Education is
most determinative of whether citizens develop the habits needed to
investigate problematic beliefs and situations while communicating
openly. While every culture aims to convey values and beliefs to the
coming generation, the most important thing is to distinguish between
education which inculcates collaborative and creative hypothesizing
from education which foments obeisance to parochialism and dogma. This
same caution applies to philosophy itself.</p>

<h2 id="Ethi">6. Ethics</h2>

<p>
Dewey wrote and spoke extensively on ethics throughout his career;
some writings were explicitly about ethics, but ethical analyses
appear in works with other
 foci.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-35" id="ref-35">35</a>]</sup>
 As elsewhere, Dewey critiques then reconstructs traditional views; he
argued it is typical for traditional systems (e.g., teleological,
deontological, or virtue-based) to seek comprehensive and monocausal
accounts of, for example, ultimate aims, duties, or values. Such ideal
theorizing is obligated to explain morality&rsquo;s requirements for
all individuals, actions, or characters.</p>

<p>
Dewey argued for a more experimental approach. Rather than an ultimate
explanatory account of moral life, ethics should describe intelligent
methods for dealing with novel and morally perplexing situations. No
ultimate values should be stipulated or
 sought.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-36" id="ref-36">36</a>]</sup>
 The only value Dewey celebrated as (something like) ultimate was
 &ldquo;growth&rdquo;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-37" id="ref-37">37</a>]</sup>
 Ethics means inquiry into concrete, problematic conditions; such
inquiry may use theories to inform hypotheses tested in experience.
Reliable hypotheses may come to be called &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;, but
must, in the end, be considered fallible and revisable. Actual
resolutions to moral problems typically point toward plural factors
(aims, duties, virtues), rather than just one (<em>TIF</em>, LW5).
Moreover, actual conduct (including inquiry) is undertaken not by
isolated, rational actors but by social
 beings.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-38" id="ref-38">38</a>]</sup>
 &ldquo;Conduct&rdquo;, Dewey wrote,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
is always shared; this is the difference between it and a
physiological process. It is not an ethical &ldquo;ought&rdquo; that
conduct <em>should</em> be social. It <em>is</em> social, whether bad
or good. (<em>HNC</em>, MW14: 16)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Dewey&rsquo;s ethical theory, like those in education and politics,
utilizes his transactional views of experience, habit, inquiry, and
the communicative, social self. It also exemplifies his metaphysics
&mdash; a world both precarious <em>and</em> stable, where conflict is
natural and quests to ignore or permanently eradicate it are
 fantastical.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-39" id="ref-39">39</a>]</sup>
 Conflict is a generic trait of life, not a defect; theories denying
this tend to be so reductive and absolutist that they divorce inquiry
from the essential details of concrete situations, cultures, and
persons. Such strategies tend to
 fail.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-40" id="ref-40">40</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Progress in ethical theory, then, means inquiry that is more
discriminating and revelatory of consequences and
 alternatives.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-41" id="ref-41">41</a>]</sup>
 Improving inquiry requires better methods of deliberation; this means
being open to contributions from many sources: sciences, social
customs, jurisprudence, biographies, moral systems of the
 past.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-42" id="ref-42">42</a>]</sup>
 Deliberation especially benefits from what Dewey called
&ldquo;dramatic rehearsal&rdquo;, where imaginative enactment of
possible scenarios can illuminate the emotional weight and color of
potential ethical
 choices.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-43" id="ref-43">43</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>

 <a href="../dewey-moral/">Dewey&rsquo;s moral philosophy</a>
 by E. Anderson (2023) and Hildebrand (2018).</p>

<h2 id="PoliPhil">7. Political Philosophy</h2>

<p>
Dewey&rsquo;s political philosophy, like other areas, builds on the
idea that individuals are not self-subsistent social atoms but are
constituted in social environments; it also builds on humans&rsquo;
ability to inquire to solve problems in hypothetical and experimental
 ways.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-44" id="ref-44">44</a>]</sup>
 As elsewhere, theory is instrumental; concepts do not uncover an
underlying &ldquo;reality,&rdquo; but are functional (or not) in
particular, practical circumstances. Concepts and theories in
political theory are fallible and amenable to reconstruction. Dewey
rejected approaches relying upon non-empirical, <em>a priori</em>
assumptions (e.g., about human nature, progress, etc.) and those
proposing ultimate, typically monocausal, explanations. His work
criticized and reconstructed core concepts (individual, freedom,
right, community, public, state, and democracy) along naturalist and
experimentalist lines. Besides numerous articles (for academic and lay
audiences), Dewey&rsquo;s political thought is found in books
including <em>The Public and Its Problems</em> (1927b, LW2),
<em>Individualism, Old and New</em> (1930f, LW5), <em>Liberalism and
Social Action</em> (1935, LW11), and <em>Freedom and Culture</em>
(1939d, LW13). Because <em>Democracy and Education</em> (1916b,
<em>DE</em>, MW9) emphasizes profound connections between education,
society, and democratic habits&mdash;it also merits study as a
&ldquo;political&rdquo; work.</p>

<p>
Enormous changes occurred during Dewey&rsquo;s lifetime, including
massive US population growth, the rise of industrial, scientific,
technological, and educational institutions, the American Civil War,
two world wars, and a global economic depression. These events
strained prevailing liberal theories, and Dewey labored to reconceive
democracy and liberalism. &ldquo;The frontier is moral, not
physical&rdquo;, Dewey urged, proposing that democracy was tantamount
to a &ldquo;way of life&rdquo; which required continual renewal to
 survive.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-45" id="ref-45">45</a>]</sup>
 Beyond governmental machinery (universal suffrage, recurring
elections, political parties, trial by peers, etc.), he also
characterized democracy as &ldquo;primarily a mode of associated
living, of conjoint communicated experience&rdquo; (<em>DE</em>, MW9:
93; see also, <em>PP</em>, LW2: 325). Such experience, expressed
through collaborative inquiry, required intellectual and emotional
competencies so that shared problems and value differences could be
discussed and addressed. Ultimately, democracy requires faith that
experience is a sufficient resource for future solutions, and that
recourse to transcendent rules or aims can be
 outgrown.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-46" id="ref-46">46</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Dewey&rsquo;s analysis of individualism arose from earlier academic
interests and his sensitivity to contemporary economic and
technological
 pressures.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-47" id="ref-47">47</a>]</sup>
 The older &ldquo;atomic&rdquo; individualism&mdash;where natural
egoists vie to maximize their standing&mdash;was now harming not
protecting individuals; deployed as a rhetorical pretext, it was
enabling wealthy and powerful interests to undermine most of the
protections which initially justified
 liberalism.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-48" id="ref-48">48</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Dewey&rsquo;s counter-proposal was &ldquo;renascent
 liberalism&rdquo;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-49" id="ref-49">49</a>]</sup>
 Reconstructing its core concept (&ldquo;atomic&rdquo; individuals
become &ldquo;social&rdquo;), made other key political notions
revisable&mdash;e.g., &ldquo;liberty&rdquo;, &ldquo;freedom&rdquo;,
and &ldquo;rights&rdquo; &mdash;as all were resituated in an
instrumentalist framework (<em>LSA</em>, LW11: 35; <em>E</em>, MW5:
 394).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-50" id="ref-50">50</a>]</sup>
 Also revised are notions of &ldquo;community&rdquo; and
&ldquo;public&rdquo;. A democratic &ldquo;public&rdquo; forms around
problems, and aims to conduct experimental inquiry that leads to
redress (<em>PP</em>, LW2: 314). Dewey also expressed a grave concern,
still with us today, regarding &ldquo;inchoate&rdquo; publics. Such
publics include members lacking the education, time, and attention
necessary for inquiry. They present democracy with perhaps its most
significantly undermining condition (<em>PP</em>, LW2: 321, 317).</p>

<h2 id="ArtAestExpe">8. Art and Aesthetic Experience</h2>

<p>
Dewey&rsquo;s magnum opus on aesthetics, <em>Art as Experience</em>
(<em>AE</em>, LW10: 31) states that art, as a conscious idea, is
&ldquo;the greatest intellectual achievement in the history of
humanity&rdquo;
 (31).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-51" id="ref-51">51</a>]</sup>
 Such high praise deserves notice. Dewey began writing about
aesthetics very early, regarding art&rsquo;s relevance to psychology
(1887, EW2), to education (1897c, EW5), the invidious distinction
between &ldquo;fine&rdquo; and &ldquo;practical&rdquo; art (1891, EW3:
310&ndash;311), and on Bosanquet (1893, EW4). His own theory emerged
in <em>Experience and Nature</em> (1925a, <em>EN</em>, LW1) and
flourished in <em>AE</em> (1934b); he proposed aesthetics as central
to philosophy&rsquo;s mission, namely rendering everyday experience
more fulfilling and meaningful.</p>

<p>
Dewey&rsquo;s aesthetics has four main objectives and an overarching
purpose. First, it explicates artworks&rsquo; ontology, the
interrelated processes of making and appreciation, and specifies the
functions of interpretation and
 criticism.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-52" id="ref-52">52</a>]</sup>
 Second, it examines arts&rsquo; social role in presenting,
reimagining, and projecting human identity. Third, it analyzes the
communicative functions of art, especially in education and political
life. Finally, it describes and analyzes the implications of
art&rsquo;s expression as experience; such experience can reach levels
of integration as they become qualitatively distinct, or
 &ldquo;consummatory&rdquo;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-53" id="ref-53">53</a>]</sup>
 Consummatory experience happens occasionally; sometimes it occurs not
in an &ldquo;artistic&rdquo; context (concert, museum, etc.) but in
unexpectedly quotidian circumstances. It is life at its fullest. The
overarching purpose of Dewey&rsquo;s aesthetics is determining how
<em>more</em> of life&rsquo;s experiences could become
consummatory.</p>

<p>
The main problem posed by <em>AE</em> is: How did a chasm arise
between the arts, artists and ordinary people? How have cultural
conditions and aesthetic theories (reinforced by institutions)
isolated &ldquo;art and its appreciation by placing them in a realm of
their own, disconnected from other modes of experiencing&rdquo;?
(<em>AE</em>, LW10: 16) <em>AE</em> makes art&rsquo;s natural
continuities with everyday life explicit, while seeking to prevent its
reduction to mere entertainment or &ldquo;transient pleasurable
excitations&rdquo;. (<em>AE</em>, LW10:
 16)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-54" id="ref-54">54</a>]</sup>
 Dewey criticizes traditional aesthetics&rsquo; spectatorial (or
theoretical) starting point and offers radically empirical accounts of
art making, appreciation, expression, form, and criticism. Because
aesthetic experience has organic roots, it can be recognized even in
everyday objects and
 events.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-55" id="ref-55">55</a>]</sup>
 Again, the goal is dissolution of dualisms between &ldquo;fine&rdquo;
and &ldquo;useful&rdquo; objects to foment a greater &ldquo;continuity
of esthetic experience with normal processes of living&rdquo;
(<em>AE</em>, LW10: 16).</p>

<h3 id="DeweReliBack">9.1 Dewey&rsquo;s Religious Background</h3>

<p>
Dewey grew up in a religious family; his devout mother pressured her
sons to live up to a similar devotion. His family church was
Congregationalist; a bit later, including in college, Liberal
Evangelicalism proved more acceptable. At twenty-one, while living in
Oil City, Pennsylvania, Dewey had a &ldquo;mystic experience&rdquo;
which he reported to friend Max Eastman:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
There was no vision, not even a definable emotion&mdash;just a
supremely blissful feeling that his worries [about whether he prayed
sufficiently in earnest] were over. (Dykhuizen 1973: 22)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Dewey belonged to congregations for about thirty-five years, turning
away circa 1894 as he left for a post in Chicago. After that,
Dewey&rsquo;s deepest loyalties lay outside religion; he was, as John
J. McDermott put it,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
an unregenerate philosophical naturalist, one for whom the human
journey is constitutive of its own meaning and is not to be rescued by
any transcendent explanations, principles of accountability, or
posthumous salvation. (McDermott 2006, 50&ndash;51)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Dewey returned to philosophical issues of religion in the
1930&rsquo;s. &ldquo;What I Believe&rdquo; (1930, LW5) argued for a
new kind of &ldquo;faith&rdquo;, a &ldquo;tendency toward
action&rdquo;. Such a faith was not transcendental, but signified that
&ldquo;experience itself is the sole ultimate authority&rdquo;
(&ldquo;What I Believe&rdquo;, LW5: 267). This faith arises actively,
from &ldquo;the full participation of all our powers in the endeavor
to wrest from each changing situation of experience its own full and
unique meaning&rdquo; (&ldquo;What I Believe&rdquo;, LW5: 272). In
1933&ndash;34, Dewey gave the Terry Lectures at Yale, published as
<em>A Common Faith</em> (1934a, <em>ACF</em>, LW9), his major
statement on religion and religious experience.</p>

<h3 id="AligNatuReli">9.2 Aligning Naturalism and Religion</h3>

<p>
Dewey&rsquo;s endeavor in <em>A Common Faith</em> seems, in
retrospect, insurmountable: to reconstruct religion in a way
harmonious with his empirical naturalism, while transforming religious
experience and belief to support and advance a secular conception of
democracy. Religions vary, of course, but typically posit
transcendent, eternal, unobservable entities and reveal themselves in
ways which are not, shall we say, open to verification. Empirical
experience, typically, is cast as inferior&mdash;castigated as flux,
illusion, uncertainty, or confusion &mdash; and must be set aside.
Dewey had squared himself against the metaphysics, epistemology, and
seemingly the morality, of major religions.</p>

<p>
Who was <em>ACF</em>&rsquo;s intended audience? Dewey was <em>not</em>
addressing believers content with supernatural religion, <em>nor</em>
religious liberals seeking a compromise that would place scientific
and spiritual truths in separate categories. He was <em>not</em>
addressing militant atheists, and rejected their
 dogmatism.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-56" id="ref-56">56</a>]</sup>
 Rather, <em>ACF</em> addressed those who had abandoned
supernaturalism yet still believed themselves religious
(&ldquo;Experience, Knowledge, and Value&rdquo;, LW14: 79&ndash;80).
<em>ACF</em> meant to salvage whatever made the religious attitude
valuable in experience while shedding traditional religious frameworks
and supernaturalistic beliefs.</p>

<h3 id="ReliVsReli">9.3 &ldquo;Religion&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Religious&rdquo;</h3>

<p>
Dewey&rsquo;s strategy was to divorce &ldquo;religious
experience&rdquo; from religion, showing how the former might arise
within a natural and social
 context.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-57" id="ref-57">57</a>]</sup>
 He found that none of the qualities reported by religious
experiencers (feelings of peace, wholeness, security, etc.), offered
evidence for the supernatural. (<em>ACF</em>, LW9ff.) He also found
that religious experience is not self-enclosed; it can color or affect
other experiences. Just as sunset may exhibit &ldquo;aesthetic&rdquo;
dimensions or a linguistic remark may betray a &ldquo;moral&rdquo;
tint, various experiences may have a &ldquo;religious&rdquo; aspect
(<em>ACF</em>, LW9: 9.). The &ldquo;religious&rdquo; character of
experience, then, is attitudinal, lending &ldquo;deep and enduring
support to the processes of living&rdquo; (<em>ACF</em>, LW9: 15).
Dewey analyzed such religiosity as a kind of coping. Consider three
options for coping: (1) <em>accommodate</em> an obstacle by resigning
to put up with conditions imposed; (2) <em>adapt</em> or modify the
obstacle&rsquo;s conditions to one&rsquo;s liking; finally, (3)
<em>adjust</em> to the obstacle by changing one&rsquo;s attitude
<em>and</em> altering conditions. (Consider, as <em>adjustment</em>,
the case of of <em>becoming a parent</em> which demands significant
changes that encompass <em>both</em> self <em>and</em> environment.)
Option (3) (<em>adjustment</em>) is characteristic of religious
experience for it is &ldquo;inclusive and deep seated&rdquo; and
transformative of attitudes in &ldquo;generic and enduring&rdquo; ways
(<em>ACF</em>, LW9: 12,13). Adjustment projects imaginative
possibilities and puts them into action&mdash;both in oneself (wants,
aims, ideals) and in surrounding conditions. The cumulative impact of
adjustment is often the evolution of identity (<em>ACF</em>, LW9:
 13).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-58" id="ref-58">58</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3 id="FaitGod">9.4 Faith and God</h3>

<p>
Dewey&rsquo;s effort to naturalize religion reinterpreted other
traditional notions, including &ldquo;faith&rdquo; and
&ldquo;God&rdquo;. Typically, faith is juxtaposed against reason.
Faith requires neither empirical inquiry nor verification; it reposes
in the transcendent and ultimate, in &ldquo;things not seen&rdquo;. It
typically connotes intellectual acceptance, without proof, of
religious propositions (e.g., &ldquo;God exists and loves
mankind&rdquo;).</p>

<p>
Dewey made at least two important criticisms of traditional faith.
First, faith is too closely identified with <em>intellectual</em>
acceptance, eclipsing its pragmatic side; <em>faith in a cause</em>,
for example, indicates a practical <em>willingness to act</em> strong
enough to modify present desires, purposes, and conduct. By
over-identifying faith with intellectual recognition, traditional
accounts undermine inquiry and constructive action. Second, faith
tends to reify its objects (e.g., &ldquo;sin&rdquo;,
&ldquo;evil&rdquo;, etc.) making them immune to inquiry and
redescription. Creeds based on such interpretations of faith attempt
to &ldquo;solve&rdquo; problems with formulaic appeals to absolutes.
The better approach, Dewey argues, is fallibilistic and experimental:
approaching problems with empirical inquiry. Insofar as traditional
faith frustrates inquiry (and solutions), it tends to run counter to
moral aims.</p>

<p>
One faith Dewey <em>can</em> accept he calls &ldquo;natural
piety&rdquo;. Natural piety is not grounded in unseen, supernatural
powers; it is a &ldquo;just sense of nature as the whole of which we
are parts&rdquo; and the recognition that, as parts, we are</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
marked by intelligence and purpose, having the capacity to strive by
their aid to bring conditions into greater consonance with what is
humanly desirable. (ACF, LW9: 18)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Faith grounded in natural piety accepts the idea that
&ldquo;experience itself is the sole ultimate authority&rdquo;
(&ldquo;What I Believe&rdquo;, LW5: 267).</p>

<p>
Regarding God, Dewey&rsquo;s naturalism disallows traditional
models&mdash;a single being responsible for the physical and moral
universe, and its inhabitants. Belief in God is neither warranted nor
advisable. Instead, Dewey offers a reconstructed &ldquo;God&rdquo;. He
proposes we think <em>not</em> of a singular object (person) but of
the qualities to which God is compared&mdash;goodness, wisdom, love,
etc. Such descriptions reveal our highest ideals. Remove the
<em>possessor</em> of the ideals and consider how ideals <em>pull</em>
us from possibility (imagination, calculation, action) to
actualization &mdash;and one begins to understand "God" in
Dewey&rsquo;s sense:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
This idea of God, or of the divine is also connected with all the
natural forces and conditions&mdash;including man and human
association&mdash;that promote the growth of the ideal and that
further its realization&hellip;.It is this active relation between
ideal and actual to which I would give the name &ldquo;God&rdquo;.
(<em>ACF</em>, LW9: 34; see also 29&ndash;30)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="ReliSociInteCommFait">9.5 Religion as Social Intelligence&mdash;a Common Faith</h3>

<p>
As a pragmatist, a meliorist, and a humane democrat, Dewey sought to
harness the undeniable power of religion and religious experience
toward ends beneficial to all. Religion provides people with a story
about the larger universe and how we fit. He knew simple critiques of
religion were ineffective because they leave powerful needs unmet.
Dewey did not propose swapping out old religious institutions for new
ones; he hoped that emancipating religious experience from
institutional and ideological shackles might free its energies toward
a &ldquo;common faith&rdquo;, a passion for imaginative intelligence
in pursuit of moral goods. Methods of inquiry and criticism are not
mysteries; society is already deeply familiar with them. What was
necessary would be for religious persons to connect inquiry with the
enhancement of religious experience and values (<em>ACF</em>, LW9:
23). If persons could appreciate how many celebrated accomplishments
were due not to God but to intelligent, human collaboration, then
perhaps the idea of <em>community</em> could inspire a non-sectarian,
common
 faith.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-59" id="ref-59">59</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Dewey thought his call for a common faith was deeply democratic. The
idea of the supernatural was, by definition, suspicious of experience
(as an adequate guide) and, consequently, suspicious of empirical
methods. Unchecked by lived experience or experiment, supernaturalism
can produce deep divisions. Dewey&rsquo;s common faith, in contrast,
is bound up with experimental inquiry and open communication. This is
why Dewey&rsquo;s exhortation to exchange traditional religious faith
for a common faith is another expression of his ideal of experimental
democracy.</p>

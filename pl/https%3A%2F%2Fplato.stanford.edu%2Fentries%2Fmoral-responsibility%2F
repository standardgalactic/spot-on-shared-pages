<h1>Moral Responsibility</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Oct 16, 2019; substantive revision Mon Jun 3, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Making judgments about whether a person is morally responsible for
their behavior, and holding others and ourselves responsible for
actions and the consequences of actions, is a fundamental and familiar
part of our moral practices and our interpersonal relationships.</p>

<p>
The judgment that a person is morally responsible for their behavior
involves&mdash;at least to a first approximation&mdash;attributing
certain powers and capacities to that person, and viewing their
behavior as arising, in the right way, from the fact that the person
has, and has exercised, these powers and capacities. Whatever the
correct account of the powers and capacities at issue (and canvassing
different accounts is one task of this entry), their possession
qualifies an agent as morally responsible in a general sense: that is,
as one who may be morally responsible for particular exercises of
agency. Normal adult human beings may possess the powers and
capacities in question, and other agents (such as non-human animals
and very young children) are generally taken to lack them.</p>

<p>
To hold someone responsible involves&mdash;again, to a first
approximation&mdash;responding to that person in ways that are made
appropriate by the judgment that they are morally responsible. These
responses often constitute instances of moral praise or moral blame
(though there may be reason to allow for morally responsible behavior
that is neither praiseworthy nor blameworthy: see McKenna 2012,
16&ndash;17 and M. Zimmerman 1988, 61&ndash;62). Blame is a response
that may follow on the judgment that a person is morally responsible
for behavior that is wrong or bad, and praise is a response that may
follow on the judgment that a person is morally responsible for
behavior that is right or good. (See Menges 2017 for an account that
emphasizes the independence of blame from judgments about
blameworthiness.)</p>

<p>
The attention in the philosophical literature given to blame far
exceeds that given to praise. One reason for this is that
blameworthiness, unlike praiseworthiness, is often taken to involve
liability to sanction. Thus, articulating the conditions on
blameworthiness may seem the more pressing matter. Perhaps for related
reasons, there is a richer language for expressing blame than praise
(Watson [1996]2004, 283), and &ldquo;blame&rdquo; finds its way into
idioms for which there is no ready parallel employing
&ldquo;praise&rdquo;: compare &ldquo;<em>S</em> is <em>to blame</em>
for <em>x</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>S</em> is <em>to praise</em> for
<em>x</em>.&rdquo; Note, as well, that &ldquo;holding
responsible&rdquo; is not a neutral expression: it typically arises in
blaming contexts (Watson [1996]2004, 284).</p>

<p>
Additionally, there may be asymmetries in the contexts in which praise
and blame are appropriate: private blame is more familiar than private
praise (Coates and Tognazzini 2013b), and while minor wrongs may
reasonably earn blame, minimally decent behavior seems insufficient
for praise (Eshleman 2014). Finally, the widespread assumption that
praiseworthiness and blameworthiness are at least symmetrical in terms
of the capacities they require has also been questioned (Nelkin 2008,
2011; Wolf 1980, 1990). Like most work on moral responsibility, this
entry will focus largely on the negative side of the phenomenon; for
more, see the
 <a href="../blame/">entry on blame</a>.</p>
 
<p>
In everyday speech, one hears references to &ldquo;moral
responsibility&rdquo; where the point is to indicate the presence of
an obligation. Someone may say that &ldquo;the United States has a
moral responsibility to assist Ukraine,&rdquo; where this means that
the United States ought to adopt certain policies or take certain
actions. This entry, however, is concerned not with accounts that
specify people&rsquo;s responsibilities in the sense of obligations,
but rather with accounts of whether a person bears the right relation
to their actions to be properly held accountable for them.</p>

<p>
Moral responsibility should also be distinguished from causal
responsibility. We may assign causal responsibility to someone for an
outcome that they have caused, and we may also judge the person
morally responsible for having caused the outcome. But the powers and
capacities that are required for moral responsibility are not
identical with an agent&rsquo;s causal powers, so we cannot always
infer moral responsibility from an assignment of causal
responsibility. A young child can cause an outcome while failing to
fulfill the general requirements on moral responsibility, and even
agents who fulfill the general requirements on moral responsibility
may explain or defend their behavior in ways that call into question
their moral responsibility for outcomes for which they are causally
responsible. Suppose that <em>S</em> causes an explosion by flipping a
switch: the fact that <em>S</em> had no reason to expect such an
outcome may call into question their moral responsibility (or at least
their blameworthiness) for the explosion without calling into question
their causal contribution to it. (For discussion of moral
responsibility for causal outcomes, see
 <a href="#RespForOutc">&sect;3.5</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
Having distinguished different senses of &ldquo;responsibility,&rdquo;
the word will be used in what follows to refer to &ldquo;moral
responsibility&rdquo; in the sense specified above.</p>

<p>
For a long time, the bulk of philosophical work on moral
responsibility was conducted in the context of debates about free will
and the threat that determinism might pose to free will. A largely
unquestioned assumption was that free will is required for moral
responsibility, and the central questions had to do with the
ingredients of free will and with whether their possession is
compatible with determinism. Recently, however, the literature on
moral responsibility has addressed issues that are of interest
independently of worries about determinism. Much of this entry will
deal with these latter aspects of the moral responsibility debate.
However, it will be useful to begin with issues at the intersection of
concerns about free will and moral responsibility.</p>

<h2 id="FreeRespDete">1. Freedom, Responsibility, and Determinism</h2>

<p>
What power do responsible agents exercise over their actions? One
(partial) answer is that the relevant power is a form of control, and,
in particular, a form of control such that the agent <em>could have
done otherwise</em> than to perform the action in question. This
captures one standard notion of free will, and one of the central
issues in debates about free will has been about whether possession of
it (free will, in the ability-to-do-otherwise sense) is compatible
with causal determinism (or with, for example, divine
foreknowledge&mdash;see the
 <a href="../free-will-foreknowledge/">entry on foreknowledge and free will</a>).</p>
 
<p>
If causal determinism obtains, then the occurrence of every event
(including events involving human deliberation, choice, and action)
was made inevitable by&mdash;because it was causally necessitated
by&mdash;the facts about the past (and about the laws of nature) prior
to the event. Under these conditions, the facts about the present, and
about the future, are uniquely fixed by the facts about the past (and
about the laws of nature): given these earlier facts, the present and
the future can unfold in only one way. For more, see the
 <a href="../determinism-causal/">entry on causal determinism</a>.</p>
 
<p>
If free will requires the ability to do otherwise, then it is easy to
see why free will may be incompatible with causal determinism. One way
of getting at this <em>incompatibilist</em> worry is to focus on the
way in which performance of a given action by an agent should be
<em>up to the agent</em> if they have the sort of free will required
for moral responsibility. As the influential Consequence Argument has
it (Ginet 1966; van Inwagen 1983, 55&ndash;105), the truth of
determinism entails that an agent&rsquo;s actions are <em>not</em>
really up to the agent since they are the unavoidable consequences of
things over which the agent lacks control. Here is an informal summary
of this argument from Peter van Inwagen&rsquo;s <em>An Essay on Free
Will</em> (1983):</p>

<blockquote>
If determinism is true, then our acts are the consequences of the laws
of nature and events in the remote past. But it is not up to us what
went on before we were born, and neither is it up to us what the laws
of nature are. Therefore, the consequences of these things (including
our present acts) are not up to us. (1983: 16)
</blockquote>

<p>
For an important argument that the Consequence Argument conflates
different senses in which the laws of nature are not up to us, see
Lewis (1981). For more on incompatibilism, see the entries on
 <a href="../freewill/">free will</a>,
 <a href="../incompatibilism-arguments/">arguments for incompatibilism</a>, and
 <a href="../incompatibilism-theories/">incompatibilist (nondeterministic) theories of free will</a>,
 as well as Clarke (2003).</p>

<p>
<em>Compatibilists</em> maintain that free will and moral
responsibility are compatible with determinism. Versions of
compatibilism have been defended since ancient times. The
Stoics&mdash;Chryssipus, in particular&mdash;argued that the truth of
determinism does not entail that human actions are entirely explained
by factors external to agents; thus, human actions are not necessarily
explained in a way that is incompatible with praise and blame (see
Bobzien 1998 and Salles 2005 for Stoic views on freedom and
determinism). Similarly, philosophers in the Modern period (such as
Hobbes and Hume) distinguished the general way in which our actions
are necessitated if determinism is true from the specific instances of
necessity sometimes imposed on us by everyday constraints on behavior
(e.g., coercive pressures or physical impediments that make it
impossible to act as we would like). The difference is that the
necessity involved in determinism is compatible with agents acting as
they choose: even if <em>S</em>&rsquo;s behavior is causally
determined, it may be behavior that <em>S</em> chose to perform. And
perhaps the ability that matters for free will (and responsibility) is
just the ability to act as one chooses, which seems to require only
the absence of external constraints and not the absence of
determinism.</p>

<p>
This compatibilist tradition was carried into the 20<sup>th</sup>
century by logical positivists such as Ayer (1954) and Schlick
([1930]1966). Here is how Schlick expressed a central compatibilist
insight in 1930 (drawing, in particular, on Hume):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Freedom means the opposite of compulsion; a man is <em>free</em> if he
does not act under <em>compulsion</em>, and he is compelled or unfree
when he is hindered from without&hellip;when he is locked up, or
chained, or when someone forces him at the point of a gun to do what
otherwise he would not do. (1930 [1966: 59])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Since deterministic causal pressures do not always force one to
&ldquo;do what otherwise he would not do,&rdquo; freedom&mdash;at
least of the sort specified by Schlick&mdash;is compatible with
determinism.</p>

<p>
A related compatibilist strategy, influential in the early and
mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, was to offer a <em>conditional analysis
of the ability to do otherwise</em> (Ayer 1954, Moore 1912; for
earlier expressions, see Hobbes [1654]1999 and Hume [1748]1978). As
noted above, even if determinism is true, agents may often act as they
choose; it is also compatible with determinism that an agent who
performed act <em>A</em> (on the basis of their choice to do so) might
have performed a different action <em>on the condition that</em> the
agent had chosen to perform the other action. Even if a person&rsquo;s
actual behavior is causally determined by the actual past, it may be
that if the past had been suitably different (if the person&rsquo;s
desires, intentions, and choices had been different), then they would
have acted differently. Perhaps this is all that the ability to do
otherwise comes to.</p>

<p>
However, this compatibilist picture is open to serious objections. It
might be granted that an ability to act as one sees fit is valuable,
and perhaps related to the type of freedom at issue in the free will
debate, but it does not follow that this is <em>all</em> that
possession of free will comes to. People who have certain desires as a
result of indoctrination, brainwashing, or psychopathology may act as
they choose, but their possession of free will and moral
responsibility may be questioned. (For more on the relevance of such
factors, see
 <a href="#MoraCompCondResp">&sect;3.2</a>
 and
 <a href="#PersHistMani">&sect;3.9</a>.)
 The conditional analysis also seems open to the following
counterexample. It might be true that an agent who performs act
<em>A</em> would have omitted <em>A</em> if they had so chosen, but it
might also be true that the agent in question suffers from an
overwhelming compulsion to perform act <em>A</em>. The conditional
analysis suggests that the agent in question retains the ability to do
otherwise than <em>A</em>, but given their compulsion, it seems clear
that they lack this ability (Chisholm 1964, Lehrer 1968, van Inwagen
1983).</p>

<p>
Despite the above objections, the compatibilist project described so
far has had lasting influence. The fact that determined agents can act
as they see fit is still an important inspiration for compatibilists,
as is the fact that determined agents may have acted differently in
counterfactual circumstances. For more, see the
 <a href="../compatibilism/">entry on compatibilism</a>.
 For recent accounts related to and improving upon early compatibilist
approaches, see Fara (2008), M. Smith (2003), and Vihvelin (2004); for
criticism of these accounts, see Clarke (2009).</p>

<p>
Compatibilists have also argued that moral responsibility does not
require the ability to do otherwise. If this is right, then
determinism would not threaten responsibility by ruling out access to
alternatives (though it might threaten responsibility in other ways:
see van Inwagen 1983, 182&ndash;88 and Fischer and Ravizza 1998,
151&ndash;168). In an influential 1969 paper, Harry Frankfurt offers
examples meant to show that an agent can be morally responsible for an
action even if he could not have done otherwise. Versions of these
examples are often called <em>Frankfurt cases</em> or <em>Frankfurt
examples</em>. In the basic form of the example, an agent, Jones,
considers a certain action. Another agent, Black, would like to see
Jones perform this action and, if necessary, Black can <em>make</em>
Jones perform it by intervening in Jones&rsquo;s deliberative
processes. However, as things transpire, Black does not intervene in
Jones&rsquo;s decision making since he can see that Jones will perform
the action on his own. Black does not intervene to ensure
Jones&rsquo;s action, but he could have and would have had Jones
showed some sign that he would not perform the action on his own.
Therefore, <em>Jones could not have done otherwise</em>, yet he seems
responsible for his behavior since he does it on his own.</p>

<p>
There are questions about whether Frankfurt&rsquo;s example really
shows that Jones couldn&rsquo;t have done otherwise <em>and</em> that
he is morally responsible. How can Black be certain whether Jones
would perform the action on his own? There seems to be a dilemma here.
Perhaps determinism obtains in the universe of the example, and Black
sees some sign that indicates the presence of factors that
<em>causally ensure</em> that Jones will behave in a particular way.
But in this case, incompatibilists are unlikely to grant that Jones is
morally responsible since they believe that moral responsibility is
incompatible with determinism. On the other hand, perhaps determinism
is not true in the universe of the example, but then it is not clear
that the example excludes alternatives for Jones: if Jones&rsquo;s
behavior isn&rsquo;t causally determined, then perhaps he <em>can</em>
do otherwise. For objections to Frankfurt&rsquo;s original example
along these lines, see Ginet (1996) and Widerker (1995); for defenses
of Frankfurt, see Fischer (2002; 2010); and for refined versions of
Frankfurt&rsquo;s example, meant to clearly deny Jones access to
alternatives, see Mele and Robb (1998), Hunt (2000), and Pereboom
(2000; 2001, 18&ndash;28). For a valuable collection on this topic,
see Widerker and McKenna (2006).</p>

<p>
In response to such criticisms, Frankfurt has said that his example
was intended mainly to draw attention to the fact &ldquo;that making
an action unavoidable <em>is not the same thing</em> as bringing it
about that the action is performed&rdquo; (2006, 340; emphasis in
original). In particular, while determinism may make an agent&rsquo;s
action unavoidable, it does not follow that the agent acts
<em>only</em> because determinism is true: it may also be true that
the agent acts a certain way because they want to. The point of his
original example, Frankfurt suggests, was to draw attention to the
significance that the actual causes of an agent&rsquo;s behavior can
have independently of whether the agent might have done something
else. Frankfurt concludes that &ldquo;[w]hen a person acts for reasons
of his own &hellip; the question of whether he could have done
something else instead is quite irrelevant&rdquo; for the purposes of
assessing responsibility (2006, 340). A focus on the actual causes
that lead to behavior, as well as investigation into when an agent can
be said to act on <em>their own</em> reasons, has characterized a
great deal of work on responsibility since Frankfurt&rsquo;s
essay.</p>

<h2 id="SomeApprMoraResp">2. Some Approaches to Moral Responsibility</h2>

<h3 id="ForwLookAcco">2.1 Forward-Looking Accounts</h3>

<p>
Forward-looking approaches to moral responsibility justify
responsibility practices by focusing on the beneficial consequences
that can be obtained by engaging in these practices. This approach was
influential in the earlier parts of the 20<sup>th</sup> century (as
well as before), had fallen out of favor by the closing decades of
that century, and has recently been the subject of renewed
interest.</p>

<p>
Forward-looking perspectives emphasize one of the points discussed in
the previous section: an agent&rsquo;s being subject to determinism
does not entail that they are subject to constraints that force them
to act independently of their choices. If this is true, then,
regardless of the truth of determinism, it may be useful to offer
certain incentives to agents&mdash;to praise and blame them&mdash;in
order to encourage them to make certain future choices and thus to
secure positive behavioral outcomes.</p>

<p>
According to some articulations of the forward-looking approach, to be
a responsible agent is simply to be an agent whose motives, choices,
and behavior can be shaped in this way. Thus, Schlick argued that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The question of who is responsible is the question concerning the
<em>correct point of application of the motive</em>&hellip;. in this
its meaning is completely exhausted; behind it lurks no mysterious
connection between transgression and requital&hellip;. It is a matter
only of knowing who is to be punished or rewarded, in order that
punishment and reward function as such&mdash;be able to achieve their
goal. (1930 [1966: 61]; emphasis in original)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
According to Schlick, the goals of punishment and reward have nothing
to do with the past: the idea that punishment &ldquo;is a natural
<em>retaliation</em> for past wrong, ought no longer to be defended in
cultivated society&rdquo; ([1930]1966, 60; emphasis in original).
Instead, punishment ought to be &ldquo;concerned only with the
institution of causes, of <em>motives</em> of conduct &hellip;.
Analogously, in the case of reward we are concerned with an
incentive&rdquo; ([1930]1966, 60; emphasis in original).</p>

<p>
J. J. C. Smart (1961) also defended a well-known forward-looking
approach to responsibility. Smart claimed that to blame someone for
their behavior is simply to assess the behavior negatively (to
&ldquo;dispraise&rdquo; it) while simultaneously ascribing
responsibility for the behavior to the agent. And, for Smart, an
ascription of responsibility merely involves taking an agent to be
such that they would have omitted the behavior if they had been
provided with a motive to do so. Whatever sanctions may follow an
ascription of responsibility are administered with eye to giving an
agent a motive to refrain from such behavior in the future.</p>

<p>
Smart&rsquo;s approach has its contemporary defenders (Arneson 2003),
but many have found it lacking. R. Jay Wallace argues that an approach
like Smart&rsquo;s &ldquo;leaves out the underlying
<em>attitudinal</em> aspect of moral blame&rdquo; (Wallace 1996, 56,
emphasis in original; see the next subsection for more on blaming
attitudes). According to Wallace, the attitudes involved in blame are
&ldquo;backward-looking and focused on the individual agent who has
done something morally wrong&rdquo; (Wallace 1996, 56). But a
forward-looking approach, with its focus on bringing about desirable
outcomes &ldquo;is not directed exclusively toward the individual
agent who has done something morally wrong, but takes account of
<em>anyone else</em> who is susceptible to being influenced by our
responses&rdquo; (Wallace 1996, 56; emphasis added). In exceptional
cases, a focus on beneficial outcomes may provide grounds for treating
as blameworthy those who are known to be innocent (Smart 1973). This
feature of some forward-looking approaches has led to particularly
strong criticism.</p>

<p>
Recent efforts have been made to develop partially forward-looking
accounts of responsibility that evade some of the criticisms mentioned
above. These accounts justify our general system of responsibility
practices by appeal to its suitability for fostering moral agency and
the acquisition of capacities required for such agency. Most notable
in this regard is Manuel Vargas&rsquo;s &ldquo;agency cultivation
model&rdquo; of responsibility (2013; also see Jefferson 2019 and
McGeer 2015). Recent conversational accounts of responsibility
 (<a href="#ConvApprResp">&sect;3.3</a>)
 also have a forward-looking component insofar as they regard those
with whom one might have fruitful moral interactions as candidates for
responsibility. Some responsibility skeptics have also emphasized the
forward-looking benefits of certain responsibility practices. Derk
Pereboom&mdash;who rejects desert-based blame&mdash;has argued that
some conventional blaming practices can be maintained (even after
ordinary notions of blameworthiness have been left behind) insofar as
these practices are grounded in &ldquo;non-desert invoking moral
desiderata&rdquo; such as &ldquo;protection of potential victims,
reconciliation to relationships both personal and with the moral
community more generally, and moral formation&rdquo; (2014, 134; also
see Caruso 2016, Caruso and Pereboom 2022, Levy 2012, Milam 2016).

<h3 id="ReacAttiAppr">2.2 The Reactive Attitudes Approach</h3>

<h4 id="FreeRese">2.2.1 &ldquo;Freedom and Resentment&rdquo;</h4>

<p>
P. F. Strawson&rsquo;s 1962 paper, &ldquo;Freedom and
Resentment,&rdquo; is the inspiration for a great deal of contemporary
work on responsibility, especially the work of compatibilists.
Strawson focuses on the emotions&mdash;the reactive
attitudes&mdash;that play a fundamental role in our practices of
holding one another responsible. He suggests that attending to the
logic of these emotional responses yields an account of what it is to
be open to praise and blame that need not invoke the
incompatibilist&rsquo;s conception of free will.</p>

<p>
Part of the novelty of Strawson&rsquo;s approach is its emphasis on
the &ldquo;importance that we attach to the attitudes and intentions
towards us of other human beings&rdquo; ([1962]1993, 48) and on
&ldquo;how much it matters to us, whether the actions of other people
&hellip; reflect attitudes towards us of goodwill, affection, or
esteem on the one hand or contempt, indifference, or malevolence on
the other&rdquo; ([1962]1993, 49). For Strawson, our practices of
holding others responsible are largely responses to these things: that
is, &ldquo;to the quality of others&rsquo; wills towards us&rdquo;
([1962]1993, 56).</p>

<p>
To get a sense of the importance of <em>quality of will</em> for our
interpersonal relations, note the difference in your response to one
who injures you accidentally as compared to how you respond to one who
does you the same injury out of &ldquo;contemptuous disregard&rdquo;
or &ldquo;a malevolent wish to injure [you]&rdquo; (P. Strawson
[1962]1993, 49). The second case is likely to arouse a type and
intensity of resentment that would not reasonably be felt in the first
case. Corresponding points may be made about gratitude: you would
likely not have the same feelings of gratitude toward a person who
benefits you accidentally as you would toward one who does so out of
concern for your welfare.</p>

<p>
According to Strawson, the tendency to respond with reactive attitudes
to another&rsquo;s display of good or ill will involves imposing on
the other a demand for moral respect and due regard ([1962]1993, 63).
Thus, among the circumstances that mollify a person&rsquo;s negative
reactive attitudes are those which show that&mdash;perhaps despite
initial appearances&mdash;the demand for due regard has not been
ignored or flouted. When someone explains that the injury they caused
you was entirely unforeseen and accidental, they indicate that their
regard for your welfare was not insufficient and that they are,
therefore, not an appropriate target of the attitudes involved in
blame.</p>

<p>
An agent who excuses themselves from blame in the above way is not
calling into question their status as a generally responsible agent:
they are still open to the demand for due regard and liable, in
principle, to reactive responses. Other agents, however, may be inapt
targets for blame and the reactive emotions precisely because they are
not legitimate targets of a demand for regard. In these cases, an
agent is not <em>excused</em> from blame, they are <em>exempted</em>
from it: it is not that their behavior is discovered to have been
non-malicious, but rather that they are recognized as one of whom
better behavior cannot reasonably be demanded. (The widely-used
terminology in which the above contrast is
drawn&mdash;&ldquo;excuses&rdquo; versus
&ldquo;exemptions&rdquo;&mdash;is due to Watson [1987]2004).</p>

<p>
For Strawson, the most important group of exempt agents includes those
who are, at least for a time, significantly impaired for normal
interpersonal relationships. These agents may be children, or
psychologically impaired like the &ldquo;schizophrenic&rdquo; (P.
Strawson [1962]1993, 51). Alternatively, exempt agents may simply be
&ldquo;wholly lacking &hellip; in moral sense&rdquo; (P. Strawson
[1962]1993, 58), perhaps because they suffered from &ldquo;peculiarly
unfortunate &hellip; formative circumstances&rdquo; (P. Strawson
[1962]1993, 52). These agents are not candidates for the range of
responses involved in our personal relationships because they do not
participate in these relationships in the right way for such responses
to be sensibly applied to them. Rather than taking up
interpersonally-engaged attitudes (that presuppose a demand for
respect) toward exempt agents, we take an objective attitude toward
them. Such an agent may be regarded merely as &ldquo;an object of
social policy,&rdquo; something &ldquo;to be managed or handled or
cured or trained&rdquo; (P. Strawson [1962]1993, 52).</p>

<p>
Strawson&rsquo;s perspective has an important compatibilist upshot.
For one thing, Strawson claims that our &ldquo;commitment to
participation in ordinary interpersonal relationships is &hellip; too
thoroughgoing and deeply rooted for us to take seriously the thought
that&rdquo; the truth of determinism entails that such relationships
do not, or should not, exist ([1962]1993, 54); but being involved in
these relationships &ldquo;precisely is being exposed to the range of
reactive attitudes&rdquo; that constitute our responsibility practices
([1962]1993, 54). So, regardless of the truth of determinism, we
cannot give up&mdash;not entirely at least&mdash;these ways of
engaging with one another. Strawson also insists that the truth of
determinism would not show that human beings generally occupy excusing
or exempting conditions. It would not follow from the truth of
determinism &ldquo;that anyone who caused an injury <em>either</em>
was quite simply ignorant of causing it <em>or</em> had acceptably
overriding reasons for&rdquo; doing so (P. Strawson [1962]1993, 53;
emphasis in original); nor would it follow &ldquo;that nobody knows
what he&rsquo;s doing or that everybody&rsquo;s behaviour is
unintelligible in terms of conscious purposes or that everybody lives
in a world of delusion or that nobody has a moral sense&rdquo; (P.
Strawson [1962]1993, 59).</p>

<h4 id="CritStraAppr">2.2.2 Criticisms of Strawson&rsquo;s Approach</h4>

<p>
Strawson argues that learning that determinism is true would not raise
general concerns about our responsibility practices. This is because
the truth of determinism would not show that human beings are
<em>generally abnormal</em> in a way that would call into question
their openness to the reactive attitudes: &ldquo;it cannot be a
consequence of any thesis which is not itself self-contradictory that
abnormality is the universal condition&rdquo; (P. Strawson [1962]1993,
54). But it has been noted that while the truth of determinism might
not suggest universal abnormality, it may well show that normal human
beings are morally incapacitated in a way that is relevant to our
responsibility practices (Russell 1992, 298&ndash;301).
Strawson&rsquo;s claims that we are too deeply and naturally committed
to our reactive-attitude-involving practices to give them up, and that
doing so would irreparably distort our moral lives, have also been
questioned (Nelkin 2011, 42&ndash;45; G. Strawson 1986, 84&ndash;120;
Watson [1987]2004, 255&ndash;58).</p>

<p>
A different objection emphasizes the <em>response-dependence</em> of
Strawson&rsquo;s account: that is, the way it explains an
agent&rsquo;s responsibility in terms of the responses that
characterize a given community&rsquo;s responsibility practices,
rather than in terms of independent facts about whether the agent is
responsible. This feature of Strawson&rsquo;s approach invites the
following reading:</p>

<blockquote>
In Strawson&rsquo;s view, there is no such independent notion of
responsibility that explains the propriety of the reactive attitudes.
The explanatory priority is the other way around: It is not that we
hold people responsible because they <em>are</em> responsible; rather,
the idea (<em>our</em> idea) that we are responsible is to be
understood by the practice, which itself is not a matter of holding
some propositions to be true, but of expressing our concerns and
demands about our treatment of one another. (Watson [1987]2004, 222;
emphasis in original; see Bennett 1980 for a related, non-cognitivist
interpretation of Strawson&rsquo;s approach)
</blockquote>

<p>
Strawson&rsquo;s approach would be particularly problematic if, as the
above reading might suggest, it entails that a group&rsquo;s
responsibility practices are&mdash;as they stand and <em>however</em>
they stand&mdash;beyond criticism simply because they are that
group&rsquo;s practices (Fischer and Ravizza 1993, 18).</p>

<p>
But there is something to be said from the other side of the debate.
It may seem obvious that people are appropriately held responsible
only if there are independent facts about their responsibility status.
But as Wallace argues, it can be difficult &ldquo;to make sense of the
idea of a prior and thoroughly independent realm of moral
responsibility facts&rdquo; that is separate from our practices and
yet to which our practices must answer (1996, 88). For Wallace, giving
up on practice-independent responsibility facts doesn&rsquo;t mean
giving up on facts about responsibility; rather, &ldquo;we must
interpret the relevant facts [about responsibility] as somehow
dependent on our practices of holding people responsible&rdquo; (1996,
89). Such an interpretation requires an investigation into our
practices, and what emerges most conspicuously, for Wallace, is the
degree to which our responsibility practices are organized around a
fundamental commitment to fairness (1996, 101). Wallace develops this
commitment to norms of fairness into an account of the conditions
under which people are appropriately held morally responsible (1996,
103&ndash;109). (For a more recent defense of the response-dependent
approach to responsibility, see Shoemaker 2017b; for criticism of such
approaches, see Todd 2016.)</p>

<h4 id="ReseBlam">2.2.3 Resentment and Blame</h4>

<p>
Due to Strawson&rsquo;s influence, philosophers often now think of
blameworthiness as centrally involving an agent&rsquo;s being an
appropriate object of certain emotions, particularly resentment. (For
accounts that focus instead on the appropriateness of guilt, see
Carlsson 2017, Clarke 2016, and Duggan 2018, as well as some of the
essays in Carlsson 2022).</p>

<p>
Emotions seem to have, in some way or other, a representational
component, and whether an emotion is fitting in a given context can be
assessed, at least in part, in terms of its representational accuracy.
So, for example, the emotion of fear may represent its object as
dangerous and an episode of fear may be fitting if the object of that
emotion is in fact dangerous. (For more, see the
 <a href="../emotion/">entry on emotion</a>.)
 It is possible, then, to give an account of blameworthiness in terms
of the fittingness of resentment, which will involve giving an account
of how resentment represents its object. Recent efforts along these
lines include Graham (2014), Rosen (2015), and Strabbing (2019), all
of whom take resentment to involve certain thoughts, and the
fittingness of resentment to depend on the accuracy of these thoughts.
As Rosen puts it, &ldquo;[f]or <em>X</em> to be morally blameworthy
for <em>A</em> just is for it to be appropriate to resent <em>X</em>
for <em>A</em>, or in other words, for the thoughts implicit in
resentment &hellip; to be true&rdquo; (2015, 72). See D&rsquo;Arms
(2022) for criticism of Rosen&rsquo;s approach. D&rsquo;Arms and his
co-author Jacobson (2023) hold that emotional fittingness is generally
not a matter of some thought being true, it is rather a matter of
correct appraisal, though they do conceive of resentment as involving
certain thoughts since it is a cognitive &ldquo;sharpening&rdquo; of a
more basic emotion kind such as anger (2023, 109 note 6).</p>

<p>
For Graham, the thought involved in resentment is that the object of
blame &ldquo;has violated a moral requirement of respect&rdquo; (2014,
408); for Rosen, it is that &ldquo;[i]n doing <em>A</em>, <em>X</em>
showed an objectionable pattern of concern&rdquo; (2015, 77); for
Strabbing, &ldquo;the following thought partly constitutes resentment:
in doing A, S expressed insufficient good will&rdquo; (2019, 3127).
But Rosen and Strabbing find additional thoughts to also be part of
resentment. For Rosen, resentment involves not just the thought that
another has acted with an objectionable pattern of concern, it also
includes the &ldquo;<em>the retributive thought</em>&rdquo; that the
other deserves to suffer for acting as they did (2015, 83; emphasis in
original). This will rule out resentment and blame in the case of an
agent who violates a moral requirement but who &ldquo;lacked the
capacity to recognize and respond to the reasons for complying with
it&rdquo; since it would be, Rosen claims, unfair to sanction such an
agent (2015, 84). (See Wallace 1996 and Watson [1987]2004 for other
accounts that impose a fairness condition on resentment in view of its
supposed sanctioning nature.) Strabbing argues that resentment is
constituted not just by the thought that another showed insufficient
good will but also by the thought that the other &ldquo;could have
acted with a better quality of will&rdquo; (2019, 3129). Again, this
will make resentment unfitting in the case of some agents who fail to
show proper concern for others.</p>

<p>
There is disagreement about whether wrongdoers who faultlessly acquire
a commitment to flawed moral values&mdash;perhaps as a result of
cultural context&mdash;are open to blame (for more, see
 <a href="#MoraCompCondResp">&sect;3.2</a>,
 <a href="#EpisCondResp">&sect;3.10</a>). These wrongdoers may behave permissibly according to
their own culturally-supported values, yet they may also act with an
objectionable quality of will. Rosen&rsquo;s and Strabbing&rsquo;s
accounts would explain why resentment might be inappropriate in the
case of such wrongdoers: it may be unfair to sanction them or to
expect them to act with a better quality of will. On the other hand,
if the cognitive content of resentment is narrower than Rosen and
Strabbing suggest&mdash;if, for example, it involves merely an
attribution of ill will&mdash;then resentment may be fitting in some
of these cases. Alternatively, it may be possible to distinguish
between varieties of resentment: there may be a resentment-like
emotion partly constituted by relatively narrow cognitive content
(i.e., the thought that another acted with ill will), and a distinct
resentment-like emotion partly constituted by the broader cognitive
content suggested by Rosen and Strabbing. In this case, the wrongdoers
in question may be open to a type of resentment that represents them
simply as wrongdoers, but not to a more complex type of resentment;
see Hieronymi (2014) and Talbert (2014) for suggestions like this.</p>

<h3 id="ReasRespView">2.3 Reasons-Responsiveness Views</h3>

<p>
As noted in
 <a href="#FreeRespDete">&sect;1</a>,
 a lasting influence of Frankfurt&rsquo;s work was to draw attention
to the actual causes of agents&rsquo; behavior, and particularly to
whether an agent acted for their own reasons. Reasons-responsiveness
approaches have been particularly attentive to these issues. These
approaches ground responsibility by reference to agents&rsquo;
capacities for being appropriately sensitive to the rational
considerations that bear on their actions. Interpreted broadly,
reasons-responsiveness approaches include a diverse collection of
views: Brink and Nelkin (2013), Fischer and Ravizza (1998), McKenna
(2013), Nelkin (2011), Sartorio (2016), Wallace (1996), and Wolf
(1990). Fischer and Ravizza&rsquo;s <em>Responsibility and
Control</em> (1998) is the most influential articulation of this
approach.</p>

<p>
Fischer and Ravizza take Frankfurt cases
 (<a href="#FreeRespDete">&sect;1</a>)
 to show that access to alternatives is not necessary for moral
responsibility. Rather, what is required is &ldquo;guidance
control,&rdquo; which is manifested when an agent guides their
behavior in a particular direction, and regardless of whether it was
open to them to guide their behavior differently (Fischer and Ravizza
1998, 29&ndash;34).</p>

<p>
If a person&rsquo;s behavior is brought about by hypnosis or genuinely
irresistible urges, then they may not be morally responsible for their
behavior because they do not reflectively guide it in the way required
for responsibility (Fischer and Ravizza 1998, 35). More specifically,
an agent in the above circumstances is not likely to be responsible
because he &ldquo;is not responsive to reasons&mdash;his behavior
would be the same, no matter what reasons there were&rdquo; (Fischer
and Ravizza 1998, 37). Thus, Fischer and Ravizza characterize
possession of guidance control as dependent on responsiveness to
reasons. In particular, guidance control depends on whether the
psychological <em>mechanism</em> that issues in an agent&rsquo;s
behavior is responsive to reasons. (Guidance control also requires
that an agent <em>owns</em> the mechanism on which they act. According
to Fischer and Ravizza, this requires placing historical conditions on
responsibility; see
 <a href="#PersHistMani">&sect;3.9</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
Fischer and Ravizza&rsquo;s focus on mechanisms is motivated by the
following reasoning. In a Frankfurt case, an agent is responsible for
an action even though their action is ensured by external factors. But
the presence of these external factors means that the agent in a
Frankfurt case would have acted the same no matter what reasons they
were confronted with. So, the responsible agent in a Frankfurt
scenario is not responsive to reasons. Fischer and Ravizza&rsquo;s
solution to this problem is to argue that while <em>the agent</em> in
a Frankfurt case may not be responsive to reasons, the agent&rsquo;s
mechanism&mdash;&ldquo;the process that leads to the relevant upshot
[i.e., the agent&rsquo;s action]&rdquo;&mdash;may well be responsive
to reasons (1998, 38). In other words, the agent&rsquo;s
generally-specified psychological mechanism might have responded
(under counterfactual conditions) to considerations in favor of
omitting the action that the agent performed. Fischer and Ravizza thus
conclude that &ldquo;relatively clear cases of moral
responsibility&rdquo;&mdash;those in which an agent is not hypnotized,
etc.&mdash;are distinguished by the fact that &ldquo;an agent exhibits
guidance control of an action insofar as the mechanism that actually
issues in the action is his own, reasons-responsive mechanism&rdquo;
(1998, 39).</p>

<p>
But how responsive to reasons does an agent&rsquo;s mechanism need to
be? Fischer and Ravizza argue that moderate (as opposed to strong or
weak) reasons responsiveness is required for guidance control (1998,
69&ndash;85). A mechanism that is moderately responsive to reasons may
not be receptive to every sufficient reason to act in a certain way,
but it will exhibit &ldquo;an <em>understandable pattern</em> of
(actual and hypothetical) reasons-receptivity&rdquo; (Fischer and
Ravizza 1998, 71; emphasis in original). Such a pattern will indicate
that an agent understands &ldquo;how reasons fit together&rdquo; and
that, for example, &ldquo;acceptance of one reason as sufficient
implies that a stronger reason must also be sufficient&rdquo; (Fischer
and Ravizza 1998, 71). In addition, the desired pattern of regular
receptivity to reasons will include receptivity to a range of
<em>moral</em> considerations (Fischer and Ravizza 1998, 77; see Todd
and Tognazzini 2008 for criticism of Fischer and Ravizza&rsquo;s
articulation of this condition.) This will rule out attributing moral
responsibility to non-moral agents.</p>

<p>
Fischer and Ravizza&rsquo;s account has generated a great deal of
attention and criticism. Some critics focus on the contrast Fischer
and Ravizza draw between the capacity for receptivity to reasons and
the capacity for reactivity to reasons (McKenna 2005, Mele 2006a,
Watson 2001). Others are dissatisfied with their focus on the powers
of mechanisms as opposed to agents. This has led some authors to
develop agent-based reasons-responsiveness accounts that address the
concerns that led Fischer and Ravizza to their mechanism-based
approach (Brink and Nelkin 2013, McKenna 2013, Sartorio 2016).</p>

<h2 id="ContDeba">3. Contemporary Debates</h2>

<h3 id="FaceResp">3.1 The &ldquo;Faces&rdquo; of Responsibility</h3>

<h4 id="AttrVersAcco">3.1.1 Attributability versus Accountability</h4>

<p>
Do our responsibility practices accommodate distinct forms of moral
responsibility? Interest in this question stems from a debate between
Susan Wolf and Gary Watson. Among other things, Wolf&rsquo;s important
1990 book, <em>Freedom Within Reason</em>, offers a critical
discussion of &ldquo;Real Self&rdquo; theories of responsibility. On
these views, a person is responsible for behavior that is attributable
to their real self, and &ldquo;an agent&rsquo;s behavior is
attributable to the agent&rsquo;s real self &hellip; if she is at
liberty (or able) both to govern her behavior on the basis of her will
and to govern her will on the basis of her valuational system&rdquo;
(Wolf 1990, 33). A responsible agent is, therefore, not simply moved
by their strongest desires; rather, they are moved by desires that the
agent endorses insofar as the desires are in conformity either with
the agent&rsquo;s values or with their higher-order desires.
Wolf&rsquo;s central example of a Real Self View is Watson (1975). (In
an earlier paper, Wolf 1987 characterizes Watson 1975, Frankfurt 1971,
and Taylor 1976 as offering &ldquo;deep self views.&rdquo; For more on
real-self/deep-self views, see
 <a href="#PersHistMani">&sect;3.9</a>;
 for a recent presentation of a real-self view, see Sripada 2016.)</p>

<p>
According to Wolf, Real Self views can explain why people acting under
the influence of hypnosis or compulsive desires are not responsible
(1990, 33). Since these agents are unable to govern their behavior on
the basis of their valuational systems, they are alienated from their
behavior in a way that undermines responsibility. But for Wolf it is a
mark against Real Self views that they are silent on the topic of how
agents came to be the way they are. An agent&rsquo;s real self might
be the product of a traumatic upbringing, and Wolf argues that this
would give us reason to question the &ldquo;agent&rsquo;s
responsibility <em>for</em> her real self&rdquo; and thus her
responsibility for the present behavior that issues from that self
(1990, 37; emphasis in original). For an account of an agent with such
an upbringing, see Wolf&rsquo;s (1987) fictional example of JoJo; see
Watson ([1987]2004) for a related discussion of the convicted murderer
Robert Alton Harris. (For discussion of JoJo, see
 <a href="#MoraCompCondResp">&sect;3.2</a>;
 for discussion of the relevance of personal history for present
responsibility see
 <a href="#PersHistMani">&sect;3.9</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
Wolf suggests that when a person&rsquo;s real self is the product of
childhood trauma (or similar factors), then that person is potentially
responsible for their behavior only in a superficial sense that merely
attributes bad actions to the agent&rsquo;s real self (1990,
37&ndash;40). However, Wolf argues that ascriptions of moral
responsibility go deeper than such attributions can reach:</p>

<blockquote>
When &hellip; we consider an individual worthy of blame or of praise,
we are not merely judging the moral quality of the event with which
the individual is so intimately associated; we are judging the moral
quality of the individual herself in some more focused,
noninstrumental, and seemingly more serious way. (1990, 41)
</blockquote>

<p>
This deeper form of assessment requires more than that an agent is
&ldquo;able to form her actions on the basis of her values,&rdquo; it
also requires that &ldquo;she is able to form her values on the basis
of what is True and Good&rdquo; (Wolf 1990, 75). This latter ability
may be limited in an agent whose real self is the product of pressures
(such as a traumatic upbringing) that have impaired their moral
competence. (For more on moral competence, see
 <a href="#MoraCompCondResp">&sect;3.2</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
In his response to Wolf, Watson ([1996]2004) agrees that some
approaches to responsibility&mdash;i.e., <em>self-disclosure
views</em> (a phrase Watson borrows from Benson 1987)&mdash;focus
narrowly on whether behavior is attributable to an agent. But Watson
denies that these attributions constitute a merely superficial form of
assessment. Behavior that is attributable to an agent because it
issues from their valuational system often discloses something
interpersonally and morally significant about the agent&rsquo;s
&ldquo;fundamental evaluative orientation&rdquo; (Watson [1996]2004,
271). Thus, ascriptions of responsibility in this
<em>responsibility-as-attributability</em> sense are &ldquo;central to
ethical life and ethical appraisal&rdquo; (Watson [1996]2004,
263).</p>

<p>
However, Watson agrees with Wolf that there is more to responsibility
than attributing actions to agents. In addition, we <em>hold agents
responsible</em> for their behavior, which &ldquo;is not just a matter
of the relation of an individual to her behavior&rdquo; (Watson
[1996]2004, 262). When we hold responsible, we also &ldquo;demand
&hellip; certain conduct from one another and respond adversely to one
another&rsquo;s failures to comply with these demands&rdquo; (Watson
[1996]2004, 262). The moral demands, and potential for adverse
treatment, associated with holding others responsible are part of our
<em>accountability</em> (as opposed to attributability) practices, and
these features of accountability raise issues of fairness that do not
arise in the context of determining whether behavior is attributable
to an agent (Watson [1996]2004, 273; also see material in
 <a href="#ReseBlam">&sect;2.2.3</a>).
 Therefore, conditions may apply to accountability that do not apply
to attributability: perhaps &ldquo;accountability blame&rdquo; should
be&mdash;as Wolf suggested&mdash;moderated in the case of an agent
whose &ldquo;squalid circumstances made it overwhelmingly difficult to
develop a respect for the standards to which we would hold him
accountable&rdquo; (Watson [1996]2004, 281).</p>

<p>
So, on Watson&rsquo;s account, there is
responsibility-as-attributability, and when an agent satisfies the
conditions on this form of responsibility, behavior is properly
attributed to the agent as reflecting morally important features of
the agent&rsquo;s self. But there is also
responsibility-as-accountability, and when an agent satisfies the
conditions on this form of responsibility, which requires more than
the correct attribution of behavior, they can be held accountable for
that behavior in the ways that characterize moral blame.</p>

<h4 id="Attr">3.1.2 Attributionism</h4>

<p>
It has become common for the views of several authors to be described
(with varying degrees of accuracy) as instances of
&ldquo;attributionism&rdquo;; see Levy (2005) for the first use of
this term. These authors include Adams (1985), Arpaly (2003),
Hieronymi (2004), Scanlon (1998, 2008), Sher (2006, 2009), A. Smith
(2005, 2008), Schlossberger (2021), and Talbert (2012a).
Attributionists take moral responsibility assessments to be concerned
with whether an action (omission, character trait, or belief) is
attributable to an agent for the purposes of moral assessment, where
this usually means that the action (or omission, etc.) reflects the
agent&rsquo;s &ldquo;judgment sensitive attitudes&rdquo; (Scanlon
1998), &ldquo;evaluative judgments&rdquo; (A. Smith 2005), or, more
generally, the agent&rsquo;s &ldquo;moral personality&rdquo;
(Hieronymi 2008).</p>

<p>
Attributionism resembles the self-disclosure views mentioned by Watson
(see the previous subsection) insofar as both focus on the way that a
responsible agent&rsquo;s behavior discloses morally significant
features of the agent&rsquo;s self. However, attributionists are
interested in more than specifying the conditions for what Watson
calls responsibility-as-attributability. Attributionists take
themselves to give conditions for holding agents responsible in
Watson&rsquo;s <em>accountability</em> sense. (See the previous
subsection for the distinction between accountability and
attributability.)</p>

<p>
According to attributionism, fulfillment of attributability conditions
is sufficient for holding agents accountable for their behavior. This
means that attributionism rejects conditions on moral responsibility
that would excuse agents if their characters were shaped under adverse
conditions (Scanlon 1998, 278&ndash;85), or if the thing for which the
agent is blamed was not under their control (Sher 2006b and 2009, A.
Smith 2005), or if the agent can&rsquo;t be expected to recognize the
moral status of their behavior (Scanlon 1998, 287&ndash;290; Talbert
2012a). Attributionists reject these conditions on responsibility
because morally significant behavior is attributable to agents that do
not fulfill them. Attributionists have also argued that blame may
profitably be understood as a form of moral protest (Hieronymi 2001,
A. Smith 2013, Talbert 2012a); part of the appeal of this move is that
moral protests may be legitimate in cases in which the above
conditions are not met.</p>

<p>
Some argue that attributionists are wrong to reject the conditions on
responsibility mentioned in the last paragraph (Levy 2005, 2011;
Shoemaker 2011, 2015; Watson 2011). It has also been argued that the
attributionist account of blame is too close to mere negative
appraisal (Levy 2005; Wallace 1996, 80&ndash;1; Watson 2002). In
addition, Scanlon (2008) has been criticized for failing to take
negative emotions such as resentment to be central to the phenomenon
of blame (Wallace 2011, Wolf 2011; the criticism could also be applied
to Sher 2006). For overviews of attributionism, see Schlossberger
(2021) and Talbert (2022).</p>

<h4 id="Answ">3.1.3 Answerability</h4>

<p>
Building on the distinction between attributability and accountability
 (<a href="#AttrVersAcco">&sect;3.1.1</a>),
 David Shoemaker (2011 and 2015) introduces a third form of
responsibility: answerability. On Shoemaker&rsquo;s view,
attributability-responsibility assessments respond to facts about an
agent&rsquo;s character, accountability-responsibility responds to an
agent&rsquo;s degree of regard for others, and
answerability-responsibility responds to an agent&rsquo;s evaluative
judgments. A. Smith (2015) and Hieronymi (2008 and 2014) use
&ldquo;answerability&rdquo; to refer to a view more like the
attributionist perspective described in the previous subsection, and
Pereboom (2014) has used the term to indicate a form of responsibility
more congenial to responsibility skeptics.</p>

<h3 id="MoraCompCondResp">3.2 The Moral Competence Condition on Responsibility</h3>

<p>
Possession of moral competence&mdash;the ability to recognize and
respond to moral considerations&mdash;is often taken to be a condition
on moral responsibility. Wolf&rsquo;s (1987) story of JoJo illustrates
this proposal. JoJo was raised by an evil dictator and becomes the
same sort of sadistic tyrant that his father was. JoJo is happy to be
the sort of person that he is, and he is moved by precisely the
desires (e.g., to imprison and torture his subjects) that he wants to
be moved by. Thus, JoJo fulfills important conditions on
responsibility (see, in particular, the discussion of structural
accounts of responsibility in
 <a href="#PersHistMani">&sect;3.9</a>),
 however, Wolf argues that it may be unfair to hold JoJo responsible
for his objectionable behavior.</p>

<p>
JoJo&rsquo;s upbringing plays an important role in Wolf&rsquo;s
argument, but only because it left JoJo unable to appreciate the
wrongfulness of his behavior. It is JoJo&rsquo;s impaired moral
competence that does the real excusing work, and similar conclusions
of non-responsibility should be drawn about others whom we think
&ldquo;could not help but be mistaken about their [bad] values&rdquo;
(Wolf 1987, 57).</p>

<p>
Many join Wolf in arguing that impaired moral competence (perhaps on
account of one&rsquo;s upbringing or other environmental factors)
undermines moral responsibility (Benson 2001, Fischer and Ravizza
1998, Fricker 2010, Levy 2003, Russell 1995 and 2004, Wallace 1996,
Watson [1987]2004). Part of what motivates this conclusion is the
thought that it can be unreasonable to expect morally-impaired agents
to avoid wrongful behavior, and that it is therefore unfair to expose
these agents to the harm of moral blame (also see
 <a href="#ReseBlam">&sect;2.2.3</a>
 and
 <a href="#AttrVersAcco">&sect;3.1.1</a>).
 For detailed development of the moral competence requirement on
responsibility in terms of considerations of fairness, see Wallace
(1996); also see Kelly (2013), Levy (2009), and Watson ([1987]2004).
For rejection of the claim that blame is unfair in the case of
morally-impaired agents, see several of the defenders of
attributionism mentioned in
 <a href="#Attr">&sect;3.1.2</a>.</p>
 
<p>
The moral competence condition on responsibility can also be motivated
by the suggestion that impaired agents are not able to commit wrongs
that have the sort of moral significance to which blame would be an
appropriate response. While morally-impaired agents can fail to show
appropriate respect for others, these failures do not necessarily
constitute the kind of flouting of moral norms that grounds blame
(Watson [1987]2004, 234). In other words, a <em>failure to
respect</em> others, is not always an instance of blame-grounding
<em>disrespect</em> for others, since the latter (but not the former)
requires the ability to comprehend the norms that one violates (Levy
2007, Shoemaker 2011; for a reply, see Talbert 2012b).</p>

<h3 id="ConvApprResp">3.3 Conversational Approaches to Responsibility</h3>

<p>
Conversational theories of responsibility construe elements of our
responsibility practices as moves in a moral conversation.</p>

<p>
Several prominent versions of the conversational approach develop P.
F. Strawson&rsquo;s suggestion
 (<a href="#FreeRese">&sect;2.2.1</a>)
 that the negative reactive attitudes involved in blame are
expressions of a <em>demand</em> for moral regard. Considerations
about moral competence
 (<a href="#MoraCompCondResp">&sect;3.2</a>)
 are relevant here. Watson argues that a demand
&ldquo;presumes,&rdquo; as a condition on the intelligibility of
expressing it, &ldquo;understanding on the part of the object of the
demand&rdquo; ([1987]2004, 230). Therefore, since, &ldquo;[t]he
reactive attitudes are incipiently forms of communication,&rdquo; they
are intelligibly expressed &ldquo;only on the assumption that the
other can comprehend the message,&rdquo; and since the message is a
moral one, &ldquo;blaming and praising those with diminished moral
understanding loses its &lsquo;point&rsquo;&rdquo; (Watson [1987]2004,
230; see Watson 2011 for a modification of his original proposal).
Wallace argues, similarly, that since responsibility practices are
internal to moral relationships that are &ldquo;defined by the
successful exchange of moral criticism and justification&hellip;. It
will be reasonable to hold accountable only someone who is at least a
candidate for this kind of exchange of criticism and
justification&rdquo; (1996, 164).</p>

<p>
Michael McKenna&rsquo;s <em>Conversation and Responsibility</em>
(2012) offers the most developed conversational analysis of
responsibility. For McKenna, the &ldquo;moral responsibility
exchange&rdquo; occurs in stages: an initial &ldquo;moral
contribution&rdquo; of morally salient behavior; the &ldquo;moral
address&rdquo; of, e.g., blame that responds to the moral
contribution; the &ldquo;moral account&rdquo; in which the first
contributor responds to moral address with, e.g., apology; and so on
(2012, 89). Like Wallace and Watson, McKenna notes the way in which a
morally-impaired agent will find it difficult &ldquo;to appreciate the
challenges put to her by those who hold [her] morally
responsible,&rdquo; but he also argues that a sufficiently impaired
agent cannot even make the first move in a moral conversation (2012,
78). Thus, a morally-impaired agent&rsquo;s responsibility is called
into question not only because they are unable to respond
appropriately to moral demands, but also because &ldquo;she is
incapable of acting from a will with a moral quality that could be a
candidate for assessment from the standpoint of holding
responsible&rdquo; (McKenna 2012, 78). This is related to Levy&rsquo;s
and Shoemaker&rsquo;s contention
 (<a href="#MoraCompCondResp">&sect;3.2</a>)
 that impairments of moral competence can leave an agent unable to
express the type of ill will to which blame responds. By contrast,
Watson (2011), allows that significant moral impairment is compatible
with the ability to perform blame-relevant wrongdoing, even if such
impairment undermines the wrongdoer&rsquo;s moral accountability for
their actions.</p>

<p>
For another important account of responsibility in broadly
conversational terms, see Shoemaker&rsquo;s discussion of the sort of
moral anger involved in holding others accountable for their behavior
(2015, 87&ndash;117). For additional defenses and articulations of the
conversational approach to responsibility, see Darwall (2006), Fricker
(2016), and Macnamara (2015).</p>

<p>
It was suggested above that blame may amount to the expression of a
moral demand. Macnamara (2013) argues, to the contrary, that blame is
not helpfully construed in such terms, and that the prospects for
construing praise as a demand are even worse. Macnamara suggests that
we should interpret both blame and praise as ways of recognizing the
moral significance of behavior, and as calling on the blamed and the
praised to express similar recognitions of the quality of their
actions. In successful cases, this will involve the target of blame
being subject to feelings of guilt or remorse, and the target of
praise being subject to feelings of self-approbation. Similarly,
Telech (2021), interprets praise not as issuing a demand but rather as
issuing an invitation to the praiseworthy person to accept moral
credit by jointly (i.e., with the praiser) valuing what was
creditworthy in their action.</p>

<h3 id="StanHoldResp">3.4 Standing to Hold Responsible</h3>

<p>
A number of philosophers have recently investigated the conditions
under which one may lack the standing to hold another person morally
responsible. With respect to blame, the thought is that a blamer can,
for one reason or another, lack the authority to blame even if the one
they blame is blameworthy. There is disagreement about whether the
authority just mentioned amounts to a right that permits one to blame
or whether it also involves a normative power to issue a demand for
some appropriate response (e.g., an apology). With respect to the
first possibility, standingless blame is pro tanto impermissible
because one lacks the right to blame; with respect to the second
possibility, standingless blame fails to generate imperatives for the
blamee. (For the distinction just mentioned, see Fritz and Miller
2022; for accounts of the normative power involved in this context,
see Edwards 2019 and Piovarchy 2020). There is also uncertainty in the
literature about whether lack of standing should inhibit only overt
blaming responses or whether private blame&mdash;which may amount only
to a blamer&rsquo;s being subject to otherwise fitting emotional
responses (see
 <a href="#ReseBlam">&sect;2.2.3</a>)&mdash;
 can also be ruled out on grounds of lack of standing.</p>

<p>
Several conditions on standing to blame have been proposed, but most
attention has been given to two: the no-meddling condition (where one
has standing to blame only if blame would not amount to an
inappropriate intrusion into the affairs of others&mdash;see McKiernan
2016 and Seim 2019) and the non-hypocrisy condition (where one has
standing to blame only if they can do so non-hypocritically). Of these
two conditions, the second has received more attention.</p>

<p>
In a case of hypocritical blame, one blames another for violating a
norm that they themselves have unrepentantly violated. Wallace (2010)
argues that the hypocritical blamer is open to a distinct moral
objection that undermines their standing to blame. The basis for this
objection is that the hypocritical blamer denies &ldquo;the
presumption of the equal standing of persons&rdquo; (Wallace 2010,
330). This presumption&mdash;constitutive, Wallace argues, of the
moral practice in which the hypocritical blamer is engaged&mdash;is
denied because the hypocritical blamer takes themselves to remain
insulated from blame yet does not take the
similarly-morally-positioned target of their blame to enjoy the same
protection. (Wallace takes the hypocrite to lack standing not just for
expressions of blame but also for the private experience of blaming
emotions.)</p>

<p>
Fritz and Miller (2018) say that the hypocritical blamer has a
&ldquo;differential blaming disposition&rdquo;: they are disposed to
blame another but not themselves, where there is no morally relevant
difference that would justify this. This makes hypocritical blame
unfair, which provide &ldquo;a moral reason that counts against
blaming&rdquo; in contexts of hypocrisy (Fritz and Miller 2018, 122).
(It could just as well be concluded that the hypocritical blamer has
moral reason to blame <em>more</em> rather than less: that is, they
have reason to extend their blame to themselves. A hypocritical blamer
may regain standing to blame in this way; see Fritz and Miller 2018
and Todd 2019.) For Fritz and Miller, the unfairness of a differential
blaming disposition accounts for what is objectionable in hypocritical
blame. To motivate the conclusion that the hypocritical blamer lacks
standing to blame, they argue that our right to blame others is
grounded in the fact that persons are morally equal. Since
&ldquo;hypocrisy involves at least an implicit rejection of the
equality of persons&rdquo; (Fritz and Miller 2018, 125), the
hypocritical blamer rejects the very thing that would ground their
right to blame, so they lack standing to blame.</p>

<p>
Todd (2019) objects to the preceding accounts, arguing that &ldquo;we
cannot derive the non-hypocrisy condition from facts about the
equality of persons&rdquo; (2019, 371). Against Fritz and Miller, Todd
argues that reliance on the equality of persons gives an unwelcome
result: it entails that a merely inconsistent blamer lacks standing to
blame. If <em>A</em> is disposed, for no good reason, to
differentially blame <em>B</em> and <em>C</em>, then <em>A</em> has a
differential blaming disposition. So does <em>A</em>, like the
hypocritical blamer, lose standing to blame <em>B</em> and <em>C</em>?
For his own part, Todd suggests that we may not be able to derive the
non-hypocrisy condition from anything more basic (such as
considerations about rights or equality), but perhaps we can at least
give a partially unifying account of what lack of standing to blame
involves. Failure to meet an important subset of standing conditions
involves, Todd argues, a blaming agent&rsquo;s own lack of sufficient
commitment to the moral values that the agent blames others for
failing to sufficiently respect. For other defenses of this
&ldquo;commitment&rdquo; view, see Lippert-Rasmussen 2020, Riedener
2019, and Rossi 2018.</p>

<p>
In arguing against the non-hypocrisy condition, Bell (2013) notes that
&ldquo;people may &hellip; evince a wide variety of moral faults
through their blame: they can show meanness, pettiness, stinginess,
arrogance, and so on&rdquo; (2013, 275). But since the arrogant blamer
does not clearly lack standing to blame, perhaps we need not conclude
that the hypocritical blamer lacks such standing. After all, some of
the aims of blame&mdash;educating the blamer or providing them with
motivation to avoid further wrongdoing&mdash;are obtainable even if
the one who blames does so hypocritically (Bell 2013, 275). See Fritz
and Miller (2018) for a reply to Bell on these points.</p>

<p>
King (2019) is also skeptical about a standing condition on blame. He
argues (i) that the prospects are dim for giving a plausible account
of the right on which standing to blame is supposed to rest, and (ii)
that we can appeal to something other than standing to account for
what goes wrong in cases of hypocritical and meddling blame. In both
cases, the objectionable blamer simply has reason to not blame;
rather, they ought to attend to something else (to their own business
in the meddling case, to their own faults in the hypocrisy case).</p>

<p>
Standing conditions may also apply to praise. Telech (2021) notes that
one who lacks an appropriate commitment to the values that a
praiseworthy person respects may not be correctly positioned to offer
praise: the praiseworthy person may reasonably reject such a
praiser&rsquo;s invitation to accept moral credit (2021, 172).
Jeppsson and Brandenburg (2022) argue that hypocritical praise may
fail to respect the equality of persons: If <em>A</em> praises
<em>B</em> for a type of action that <em>A</em> is not committed to
performing, this may indicate that <em>A</em> holds <em>B</em> to a
higher standard than the one to which <em>A</em> holds themselves. And
what if <em>A</em> is partly responsible for <em>B</em> having to
exert themselves in a praiseworthy way? Here, <em>B</em> may rightly
ask of <em>A</em>, &ldquo;Who are <em>you</em> to praise
<em>me</em>?&rdquo; (Jeppsson and Brandenburg 2022, 671; emphasis in
original). Finally, Lippert-Rasmussen (2021) has argued that a person
may lack standing to praise themselves when they do so
hypocritically&mdash;that is, when they would not praise another on
the same grounds that they praise themselves.</p>

<h3 id="RespForOutc">3.5 Responsibility for Outcomes</h3>

<p>
It&rsquo;s widely held that moral agents can be responsible not just
for actions but also for the causal outcomes of their actions. This
can be accounted for by appeal to <em>derivative responsibility</em>:
an agent&rsquo;s responsibility for an outcome may derive from their
responsibility for a causally related action. Responsibility for
outcomes also involves an epistemic condition: the responsible agent
must have been aware of&mdash;or at least it must be that they could
have and should have been aware of&mdash;the likely consequences their
actions. (The last point is related to the material in
 <a href="#EpisCondResp">&sect;3.10</a>).
 Carolina Sartorio collects these elements in her <em>Principle of
Derivative Responsibility</em>: &ldquo;If an agent is responsible for
X, X causes Y, and the relevant epistemic conditions for
responsibility obtain, then the agent is also responsible for Y&rdquo;
(2016, 76). Blameworthiness for outcomes can perhaps be accounted for
in a related way: if an agent fulfills the relevant causal and
epistemic conditions on responsibility with respect to some outcome,
and they fulfill those conditions in a way that makes them
blameworthy, then the agent is blameworthy for the outcome. For
proposals along these lines, see Sartorio&rsquo;s <em>Principle of
Derivative Blameworthiness</em> (2016, 77) as well as Bj&ouml;rnsson
(2017b) and Gunnemyr and Touborg (2023).</p>

<p>
If an agent can be responsible for an outcome in virtue of some
earlier action, can they also be responsible for an outcome in virtue
of an omission? But what are omissions? Are they constituted by other
actions that an agent performs, or are omissions simply absences? In
the latter case, it may be difficult to see how omissions&mdash;being
absences&mdash;can enter into causal relations with events such as
outcomes. But even if omissions are not, strictly speaking, causes,
they may still be related to outcomes in a way that is sufficient to
support responsibility: when someone fails to act, it may be quite
pertinent that an outcome occurs that would not have occurred had the
agent not omitted the action in question. For development of this
idea, see Clarke (2014, Chapter 2) and Sartorio (2016, Chapter 2) as
well as the authors they cite, particularly Dowe (2000). For another
important account of responsibility for omissions, see Fischer and
Ravizza (1998, Chapter 5). Clarke (2014) offers a valuable treatment
of many issues associated with omissions; also see the essays in
Nelkin and Rickless (2017a).</p>

<p>
If responsibility for outcomes partly depends on the obtaining of
causal (or related) relationships, then factors that affect judgments
about causation may also affect judgments about moral responsibility.
For example, if different theories of causation yield different
answers to the question of whether an agent caused an outcome, they
may also yield different answers to questions about the agent&rsquo;s
responsibility for the outcome (Bernstein 2017). And in cases of group
causation, it may be that the addition or subtraction of causal
contributors will affect judgments about the degree to which any
individual in the group caused the outcome; again, a corresponding
effect on judgments about individual responsibility should be
expected. (See Bernstein 2017 and Sartorio 2015 for the last point;
both authors note that a form of moral luck may be in play here since
whether an agent is part of a larger or a smaller group of causal
contributors may be beyond the agent&rsquo;s control; regarding moral
luck, see
 <a href="#MoraLuckResp">&sect;3.7</a>)
 There may also be cases in which it is simply indeterminate what an
agent has caused, and judgments about responsibility in these cases
may likewise be indeterminate (Bernstein 2016).</p>

<p>
In contrast to the tenor of the discussion so far, Kutz (2000) argues
that founding responsibility on causal connections can&mdash;at least
in cases of group agency&mdash;lead to counterintuitive results.
Kutz&rsquo;s central example is the Allied bombing campaign that
destroyed the German city of Dresden in WWII (2000, 116&ndash;24). Far
more bombs and bombers were used in the raid than were required to
destroy the city, and each bomber pilot might plausibly claim that
their casual contribution made no difference to that outcome. Kutz
argues that, for the purposes of assessing individual moral
accountability, we should refer not to individual causal contributions
but rather to the pilots&rsquo; overlapping intentions and attitudes
that led them to participate in the raid on Dresden.</p>

<p>
Lawson (2013) develops an account similar to Kutz&rsquo;s; Petersson
(2013) objects to Kutz and defends the importance of individual causal
contributions for assessing responsibility. Sinnott-Armstrong (2005)
and Nefsky (2017) are other important investigations of the problem of
how to assess non-difference-making causal contributions. Nefsky
argues that an individual can make non-superfluous contributions to
preventing or bringing about an outcome even if their contributions do
not decide whether the outcome occurs. Gunneymr and Touborg&rsquo;s
(2023) emphasis on the way that individual, non-difference-making
causal contributions may increase or decrease the
&ldquo;security&rdquo; of an outcome is also relevant here. Kaiserman
(2024) applies a view developed in Kaiserman (2016) to cases like
Kutz&rsquo;s, arguing that an agent can partly contribute to an
outcome even if there is no identifiable part of the outcome that they
caused.</p>

<p>
Positing responsibility for outcomes may involve a commitment to
outcome moral luck
 (<a href="#MoraLuckResp">&sect;3.7</a>)
 because while an agent may control their action, whether that action
leads to a certain outcome is typically not entirely within the
agent&rsquo;s control. Skepticism about outcome moral luck may thus
lead to skepticism about responsibility and blameworthiness for
outcomes. Perhaps agents are never responsible for outcomes but only
for their action-explaining motives and intentions, or for exercising
their will in a certain way. The same may be true of blameworthiness.
Andrew Khoury argues that &ldquo;the only things that one can be
blameworthy for are those things that make one blameworthy,&rdquo; and
for Khoury, it is only the moral quality of our
&ldquo;willings,&rdquo; and never the outcomes to which these willings
may lead, that can make us blameworthy (Khoury 2018, 1363). Also see
Graham (2014) and (2017) for important contributions in this vein.</p>

<h3 id="SkepAbouResp">3.6 Skepticism about Responsibility</h3>

<p>
If moral responsibility requires free will and free will requires a
type of access to alternatives that is not compatible with determinism
(see
 <a href="#FreeRespDete">&sect;1</a>),
 then it follows that if determinism is true, no one is ever morally
responsible for their behavior. The above reasoning, and the skeptical
conclusion it reaches about responsibility, is endorsed by the
<em>hard determinist</em> perspective on free will and responsibility,
which was defended historically by Spinoza and d&rsquo;Holbach (among
others) and more recently by Honderich (2002). But given that
determinism may well be false, contemporary skeptics about
responsibility more often pursue a <em>hard incompatibilist</em> line
of argument according to which the kind of free will required for
desert-based (as opposed to forward-looking, see
 <a href="#ForwLookAcco">&sect;2.1</a>)
 moral responsibility is incompatible with the <em>truth or
falsity</em> of determinism (Pereboom 2001, 2014).</p>

Discussion of skeptical positions that do not depend on the truth of
determinism can be found in each of the four subsections below. For

<h3 id="MoraLuckResp">3.7 Moral Luck and Responsibility</h3>

<p>
A person is subject to moral luck if factors that are not under that
person&rsquo;s control affect the moral assessments to which they are
open (Nagel [1976]1979; also see Williams [1976]1981 and the
 <a href="../moral-luck/">entry on moral luck</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
Can luck affect moral responsibility? Consider an unsuccessful
assassin who shoots at their target but misses because their bullet is
deflected by a passing bird. This assassin has good <em>outcome moral
luck</em>. Because of factors beyond their control; their moral record
is better than it might have been: they are not a murderer and not
morally responsible for causing anyone&rsquo;s death. One might think,
in addition, that an unsuccessful assassin is less blameworthy than a
successful assassin with whom they are otherwise identical, and that
the reason for this is just that the successful assassin intentionally
killed someone while the unsuccessful assassin did not. (For important
recent defenses of moral luck, see Hanna 2014 and Hartman 2017)</p>

<p>
On the other hand, one might think that if the two assassins are
identical in terms of their values, goals, intentions, and
motivations, then the addition of a bit of luck to the unsuccessful
assassin&rsquo;s story cannot ground a deep contrast between the two
in terms of their moral responsibility. One way to sustain this
position is to argue that moral responsibility is a function solely of
internal features of agents, such as their motives and intentions
(Graham 2014 and Khoury 2018; also see
 <a href="#RespForOutc">&sect;3.5</a>;
 see Enoch and Marmor 2007 for the main arguments against moral luck).
Of course, the successful assassin is responsible <em>for
something</em> (killing a person) for which the unsuccessful assassin
is not, but perhaps both are responsible&mdash;and presumably
blameworthy&mdash;<em>to the same degree</em> insofar as it was true
of both that they aimed to kill, and that they did so for the same
reasons and with the same commitment toward bringing about that
outcome (M. Zimmerman 2002 and 2015).</p>

<p>
But now consider a different would-be assassin who does not even try
to kill anyone, but only because their circumstances did not favor
this option. This would-be assassin is <em>willing to kill</em> under
favorable circumstances (so they may have had good
<em>circumstantial</em> moral luck since they were not in those
circumstances). Perhaps the degree of responsibility attributed to the
successful and unsuccessful assassins described in the previous
paragraph depends not so much on the fact that they both tried to kill
as on the fact that they were both willing to kill, and the would-be
assassin may share the same degree of responsibility since they share
the same willingness to kill. But an account that focuses on what
agents would be willing to do under counterfactual circumstances is
likely to generate unintuitive conclusions about responsibility since
many agents who are typically judged blameless might willingly perform
terrible actions under the right circumstances. (M. Zimmerman 2002 and
2015 does not shy away from this consequence, but critics&mdash;Hanna
2014, Hartman 2017&mdash;have made much of it; see Peels 2015 for a
position related to Zimmerman&rsquo;s that may avoid the unintuitive
consequence just mentioned.)</p>

<p>
Once luck is taken fully into account, there is reason to worry that
responsibility may be generally undermined. Consider
<em>constitutive</em> moral luck: luck in how one is constituted in
terms of the &ldquo;inclinations, capacities, and temperament&rdquo;
one finds within oneself (Nagel [1976]1979, 28). Facts about a
person&rsquo;s inclinations, capacities, and temperament explain
much&mdash;if not all&mdash;of that person&rsquo;s behavior, and if
the facts that explain why a person acts as they do are a result of
good or bad luck, then perhaps it is unfair to hold them responsible
for their behavior. And as Nagel notes, once the full sweep of the
various kinds of luck comes into view, &ldquo;[t]he area of genuine
agency&rdquo; may shrink to nothing since our actions and their
consequences &ldquo;result from the combined influence of factors,
antecedent and posterior to action, that are not within the
agent&rsquo;s control&rdquo; ([1976]1979, 35). If this is right, then
perhaps, &ldquo;nothing remains which can be ascribed to the
responsible self, and we are left with nothing but a &hellip; sequence
of events, which can be deplored or celebrated, but not blamed or
praised&rdquo; (Nagel [1976]1979, 37).</p>

<p>
Nagel doesn&rsquo;t fully embrace a skeptical conclusion about
responsibility on the above grounds, but others have done so, most
notably, Neil Levy (2011). According to Levy&rsquo;s &ldquo;hard luck
view,&rdquo; the encompassing nature of moral luck means &ldquo;that
there are no desert-entailing differences between moral agents&rdquo;
(2011, 10). There are differences between agents in terms of their
characters and the good or bad actions and outcomes that they produce,
but Levy&rsquo;s point is that, given the influence of luck in
generating these differences, they don&rsquo;t provide a sound basis
for differential treatment of people in terms of moral praise and
blame. (See Russell 2017 for a compatibilist account that leads to a
variety of pessimism, though not skepticism, on the basis of the
concerns about moral luck.)</p>

<h3 id="UltiResp">3.8 Ultimate Responsibility</h3>

<p>
Galen Strawson&rsquo;s Basic Argument concludes that &ldquo;we cannot
be truly or ultimately morally responsible for our actions&rdquo;
(1994, 5). (Since the argument targets &ldquo;ultimate&rdquo;
responsibility, it does not necessarily exclude other forms, such as
forward-looking responsibility
 [<a href="#ForwLookAcco">&sect;2.1</a>]
 and, on some understandings, responsibility-as-attributability
 [<a href="#AttrVersAcco">&sect;3.1.1</a>].)
 The argument begins by noting that agents make the choices they do
because of what seems choiceworthy to them. (This is related to the
discussion of constitutive moral luck in
 <a href="#MoraLuckResp">&sect;3.7</a>.)
 So, in order to be responsible for their choices, agents must be
responsible for the fact that certain things seem choiceworthy to
them. But how can agents be responsible for these prior facts about
themselves? Wouldn&rsquo;t this require a prior choice on the part of
the agent, one that resulted in their present disposition to see
certain ends as choiceworthy? But this prior choice would itself be
something for which the agent would be responsible only if the agent
is also responsible for the fact that the prior choice seemed
choiceworthy to them. A regress looms here, and Strawson claims that
it cannot be stopped except by positing an initial act of
self-creation on the responsible agent&rsquo;s part (G. Strawson 1994,
5, 15). But self-creation is impossible, so no one is ever ultimately
responsible for their behavior.</p>

<p>
A number of replies to this argument are possible. One might simply
deny that <em>how</em> a person came to be the way they are matters
for present responsibility: perhaps all we need to know in order to
judge a person&rsquo;s responsibility are facts about their present
constitution and about how that constitution is related to the
person&rsquo;s present behavior. (For views like this, see the
discussion of attributionism
 [<a href="#Attr">&sect;3.1.2</a>]
 and the discussion of non-historical accounts of responsibility in
the next subsection). Alternatively, one might think that while
personal history matters for moral responsibility, Strawson&rsquo;s
argument sets the bar too high (see Fischer 2006; for a reply, see
Levy 2011, 5). Perhaps what is needed is not literal self-creation,
but simply an ability to enact changes in oneself so as to acquire
responsibility for the self that results from these changes (Clarke
2005). A picture along these lines can be found in Aristotle&rsquo;s
suggestion (in Book III of the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>) that one
can be responsible for being a careless person if one&rsquo;s present
state of carelessness is the result of earlier choices that one made
(also see Moody-Adams 1990).</p>

<p>
Roughly in this Aristotelian vein, Robert Kane offers an
incompatibilist account of how an agent can be ultimately
responsibility for their actions (1996 and 2007). On Kane&rsquo;s
view, for an agent &ldquo;to be <em>ultimately</em> responsible for
[a] choice, the agent must be at least in part responsible by virtue
of choices or actions voluntarily performed in the past for having the
character and motives he or she now has&rdquo; (2007, 14; emphasis in
original). This position may appear to be open to the regress concerns
presented in Strawson&rsquo;s argument above, but Kane thinks a
regress is avoided in cases in which a person&rsquo;s
character-forming choices are undetermined. Since these undetermined
choices will have no <em>sufficient</em> causes, there is no relevant
prior cause for which the agent must be responsible, so there is no
regress problem (Kane 2007, 15&ndash;16; see Pereboom 2001,
47&ndash;50 for criticism.)</p>

<p>
Of particular interest to Kane are potential character-forming choices
that occur &ldquo;when we are torn between competing visions of what
we should do or become&rdquo; (2007, 26). In such cases, if a person
sees reasons in favor of either choice that they might make, and the
choice that they make is undetermined, then whichever choice they make
will have been chosen for their own reasons. According to Kane, when
an agent makes this kind of choice, they shape their own character,
and since the agent&rsquo;s choice is not determined by prior causal
factors, they are responsible for that choice, for the character
shaped by it, and for the character-determined choices that the agent
may make in the future.</p>

<h3 id="PersHistMani">3.9 Personal History and Manipulation</h3>

<p>
Accounts such as Levy&rsquo;s (2011) and G. Strawson&rsquo;s (1994),
described in the two preceding subsections, argue that a
person&rsquo;s present responsibility can depend on facts about the
way that person came to be as they are. But non-historical views, such
as attributionism
 (<a href="#Attr">&sect;3.1.2</a>)
 and the views that Susan Wolf calls &ldquo;Real Self&rdquo; theories
 (<a href="#AttrVersAcco">&sect;3.1.1</a>),
 reject this contention. Real Self accounts are sometimes referred to
as &ldquo;structural&rdquo; or &ldquo;hierarchical&rdquo; theories. By
whatever name, the basic idea is that an agent is morally responsible
insofar as their will has the right structure: in particular, there
needs to be an appropriate relationship between the desires that
actually move an agent and that agent&rsquo;s values, or between the
desires that move an agent and that agent&rsquo;s higher-order
desires, the latter of which are the agent&rsquo;s reflective
preferences about which desires should move them. (For approaches
along these lines, see Dworkin 1987; Frankfurt 1971, 1987; and Watson
1975.)</p>

<p>
Harry Frankfurt&rsquo;s comparison between a willing drug addict and
an unwilling addict illustrates important features of his version of
the structural approach to responsibility. Both of Frankfurt&rsquo;s
addicts strongly desire to take the drug to which they are addicted
and these first-order desires will ultimately move both addicts to
take the drug. But the addicts have different higher-order
perspectives on their first-order desire to take the drug. The willing
addict endorses and identifies with his addictive desire, but the
unwilling addict repudiates his addictive desire to such an extent
that, when it ends up being effective, Frankfurt says that this addict
is &ldquo;helplessly violated by his own desires&rdquo; (1971, 12).
The willing addict has a kind of freedom that the unwilling addict
lacks: they may both act on the desire to take the drug, but insofar
as the willing addict is moved by a desire that he endorses, he acts
freely in a way that the unwilling addict does not (Frankfurt 1971,
19). A related conclusion about responsibility may be drawn: perhaps
the unwilling addict&rsquo;s addictive desire is alien to him in such
a way that his responsibility for acting on it is called into question
(for a recent defense of this conclusion, see Sripada 2017).</p>

<p>
Frankfurt assumes that an agent&rsquo;s higher-order desires have the
authority to speak for the agent&mdash;they reveal (or constitute) the
agent&rsquo;s &ldquo;real self,&rdquo; to use Wolf&rsquo;s language
(1990). But if higher-order desires are invoked out of a concern that
an agent&rsquo;s lower-order desires may not speak for the agent, why
won&rsquo;t the same worry recur with respect to higher-order desires?
When ascending through the orders of desires, why stop at any
particular point? Why not think that appeal to a still higher order is
always necessary to reveal where an agent stands? See Watson (1975)
for this objection, which partly motivates Watson&mdash;in his
articulation of a structural approach&mdash;to focus on whether an
agent&rsquo;s desires conform with their <em>values</em>, rather than
with their higher-order desires.</p>

<p>
Even if one agrees with Frankfurt about the structural elements
required for responsibility, one might wonder how an agent&rsquo;s
will came to have its particular structure. An objection to
Frankfurt&rsquo;s view notes that the relevant structure might have
been put in place by factors that intuitively undermine
responsibility, in which case the presence of the relevant structure
is not sufficient for responsibility (Fischer and Ravizza 1998,
196&ndash;201; Locke 1975). Fischer and Ravizza argue that &ldquo;[i]f
the mesh [between higher- and lower-order desires] were produced by
&hellip; brainwashing or subliminal advertising &hellip; we would not
hold the agent morally responsible for his behavior&rdquo; because the
psychological mechanism that produced the behavior would not be,
&ldquo;in an important intuitive sense, the <em>agent&rsquo;s
own</em>&rdquo; (1998, 197; emphasis in original). In response to this
type of worry, Fischer and Ravizza argue that responsibility has a
historical component, which they attempt to capture with their account
of how agents can &ldquo;take responsibility&rdquo; for the
psychological mechanism that produces their behavior (1998,
207&ndash;239). (For criticism of Fischer and Ravizza&rsquo;s account
of taking responsibility, see Levy 2011, 103&ndash;106 and Pereboom
2001, 120&ndash;22; for elaboration and defense of Fischer and
Ravizza&rsquo;s account, see Fischer 2004; for quite different
accounts of taking responsibility, see Enoch 2012; Mason 2019,
179&ndash;207; and Wolf 2001. For work on the general significance of
personal histories for responsibility, see Christman 1991, Vargas
2006, and D. Zimmerman 2003.)</p>

<p>
Part of Fischer and Ravizza&rsquo;s motivation for developing their
account of &ldquo;taking responsibility&rdquo; was to ensure that
agents who have been manipulated in certain ways do not count as
responsible on their view. Several examples and arguments featuring
the sort of manipulation that worry Fischer and Ravizza have played
important roles in the recent literature on responsibility. One of
these is Alfred Mele&rsquo;s Beth/Ann example (1995, 2006b), which
emphasizes the difficulties faced by accounts of responsibility that
eschew historical conditions. Ann has acquired her preferences and
values in the normal way, but Beth is manipulated by a team of
neuroscientists so that she now has preferences and values that are
identical to Ann&rsquo;s. After the manipulation, Beth reflectively
endorses her new values. Such endorsement might be a sign of the
self-governance associated with responsibility, but Mele argues that
Beth, unlike Ann, exhibits merely &ldquo;ersatz self-government&rdquo;
since Beth&rsquo;s new values were imposed on her (1995, 155). And if
other kinds of personal histories similarly undermine an agent&rsquo;s
ability to authentically govern their behavior, then agents with these
histories will not be morally responsible. For replies to Mele and
general insights into manipulation cases, see Arpaly (2003), King
(2013), and Todd (2011); for discussion of issues about personal
identity that arise in manipulation cases, see Khoury (2013), Matheson
(2014), Shoemaker (2012).</p>

<p>
One can take a hard line in Beth&rsquo;s case (Mckenna 2004). That is,
one might note that while Beth acquired her new values in a strange
way, <em>everyone</em> acquires their values in ways that are not
fully under their control. Indeed, following Galen Strawson&rsquo;s
(1994) line of argument (described in
 <a href="#UltiResp">&sect;3.8</a>),
 it might be noted that <em>no one</em> has ultimate control over
their values, and even if normal agents have some capacity to address
and alter their values, the dispositional factors that govern use of
this capacity ultimately result from factors beyond agents&rsquo;
control. Perhaps, then, Beth is not so easily distinguished from
normal agents; perhaps she is just as responsible as they are. But
this reasoning can cut both ways: instead of showing that Beth is
assimilated into the class of normal, responsible agents, it might
show that normal agents are assimilated into the class of
non-responsible agents. Derk Pereboom&rsquo;s four-case argument
reasons along these lines (1995, 2001, 2007, 2014). (The &ldquo;zygote
argument&rdquo; is also relevant here; see Mele 1995, 2006b, and
2008.)</p>

<p>
Pereboom&rsquo;s argument presents four scenarios involving Plum in
which Plum kills White while satisfying the conditions on moral
responsibility most often proposed by compatibilists (and described in
earlier sections of this entry). In Case 1, Plum is &ldquo;created by
neuroscientists, who &hellip; manipulate him directly through the use
of radio-like technology&rdquo; (Pereboom 2001, 112). These scientists
cause Plum&rsquo;s reasoning to take a certain path that culminates in
Plum deciding to kill White. Pereboom believes that Plum is clearly
not responsible for killing White in Case 1 since his behavior was
determined by the neuroscientists. In Cases 2 and 3, Plum is causally
determined to undertake the same reasoning process as in Case 1, but
in Case 2 Plum is merely &ldquo;programmed&rdquo; to do so by
neuroscientists, and in Case 3 Plum&rsquo;s reasoning is the result of
socio-cultural influences that determine his character. In Case 4,
Plum is a normal human being in a causally deterministic universe, and
he decides to kill White in the same way as in the previous cases.</p>

<p>
Pereboom claims that there is no relevant difference between Cases 1,
2, and 3, so judgments about Plum&rsquo;s responsibility should be the
same in these cases. Plum is not responsible in these cases because
his behavior is causally determined by forces beyond his control
(Pereboom 2001, 116). But then, Pereboom argues, we should conclude
that Plum is not responsible in Case 4 since causal determinism is the
defining feature of that case, and the same conclusion should apply to
anyone living in a causally deterministic universe.</p>

<p>
A possible reply to Pereboom is that the manipulation to which Plum is
subjected in Case 1 undermines his responsibility for some other
reason besides the fact that it causally determines his behavior. This
would stop the generalization of non-responsibility from Case 1 to the
subsequent cases. (See Demetriou (Mickelson) 2010, Fischer 2004, Mele
2005; for a response, see Matheson 2016;<strong> </strong>Pereboom
addresses this concern in his 2014 presentation of the argument; also
see Shabo 2010). Alternatively, it might be argued, on compatibilist
grounds, that Plum is responsible in Case 4 and that this conclusion
should be extended to the earlier cases since Plum fulfills the same
compatibilist conditions on responsibility in those cases (McKenna
2008).</p>

<p>
The four-case argument attempts to show that if determinism is true,
then we cannot be the sources of our actions in the way required for
moral responsibility. It is, therefore, an argument for
incompatibilism rather than for skepticism about moral responsibility.
But in combination with Pereboom&rsquo;s argument that we lack the
sort of free will required for responsibility even if determinism is
false (2001, 38&ndash;88; 2014, 30&ndash;70), the four-case argument
has emerged as an important motivation for skepticism about
responsibility.</p>

<h3 id="EpisCondResp">3.10 The Epistemic Condition on Responsibility</h3>

<p>
There has been a recent surge in interest in the epistemic condition
on responsibility (as opposed to the freedom or control condition that
is at the center of the free will debate).</p>

<p>
Sometimes agents act in ignorance of the bad consequences of their
actions, and sometimes their ignorance excuses them from blame. But in
other cases, an agent&rsquo;s ignorance does not excuse them. How can
we distinguish the cases where ignorance excuses from those in which
it does not? One proposal is that ignorance fails to excuse when the
ignorance is itself something for which the agent is to blame. And one
proposal for when ignorance is blameworthy is that it issues from a
blameworthy <em>benighting</em> act in which an agent culpably
impairs, or fails to improve, their epistemic position (H. Smith
1983). In such a case, the agent&rsquo;s ignorance seems to be their
own fault, so it cannot excuse them.</p>

<p>
But when is a benighting act blameworthy? Several philosophers, such
Levy (2011), Rosen (2004), and M. Zimmerman (1997), have suggested
that agents are culpable for benighting acts only when they perform
them knowingly. The idea is that ignorance for which one is
blameworthy, and that leads to blameworthy unwitting wrongdoing, must
have its source in <em>knowing</em> wrongful behavior. So, if someone
unwittingly does something wrong, then that person will be blameworthy
only if we can explain their lack of knowledge (their
&ldquo;unwittingness&rdquo;) by reference to something else that the
agent knowingly and wrongfully did. Thus, Rosen concludes that
&ldquo;<em>the only possible locus of original responsibility</em>
[for a later unwitting act] <em>is an akratic act</em>&hellip;. a
knowing sin&rdquo; (2004, 307; emphasis in original). Similarly,
Michael Zimmerman argues that &ldquo;all culpability can be traced to
culpability that involves lack of ignorance, that is, that involves a
belief on the agent&rsquo;s part that he or she is doing something
morally wrong&rdquo; (1997, 418). (In certain structural respects, the
argument here resembles Galen Strawson&rsquo;s skeptical argument in
 <a href="#UltiResp">&sect;3.8</a>)</p>
 
<p>
The above reasoning may apply not just to cases in which a person is
unaware of the consequences of their action, but also to cases in
which a person is unaware of the moral status of their behavior. A
slaveowner, for example, might think that slaveholding is permissible,
and so, on the account considered here, they will be blameworthy only
if they are culpable for their ignorance about the moral status of
slavery, which will require that they ignored evidence about its moral
status while knowing that this is something that they should not do
(Rosen 2003 and 2004).</p>

<p>
These reflections can give rise to a couple forms of skepticism about
moral responsibility (and particularly about blameworthiness). One
might endorse a form of epistemic skepticism on the grounds that we
rarely have insight into whether a wrongdoer knowingly acted wrongly
at some suitable point in the history of a given action (Rosen 2004).
Alternatively, or in addition, one might endorse a more substantive
form of skepticism on the grounds that a great many normal wrongdoers
don&rsquo;t exhibit the sort of knowing wrongdoing supposedly required
for responsibility. Perhaps very many wrongdoers don&rsquo;t know that
they are wrongdoers and their ignorance on this score is not their
fault since it doesn&rsquo;t arise from an earlier instance of knowing
wrongdoing. In this case, very many ordinary wrongdoers may fail to be
responsible for their behavior. (For skeptical conclusions along these
lines, see M. Zimmerman 1997 and Levy 2011.)</p>

<p>
There is more to the epistemic dimension of responsibility than what
is contained in the above skeptical argument, but the argument does
bring out a lot of what is of interest in this domain. For one thing,
it prominently relies on a <em>tracing</em> strategy. This strategy is
used in accounts that feature a person who does not, at the time of
action, fulfill control or knowledge conditions on responsibility, but
who nonetheless seems responsible for their behavior. In such a case,
the agent&rsquo;s responsibility may be grounded in the fact that
their failure to fulfill certain conditions on responsibility is
traceable to earlier actions undertaken by the agent when they did
fulfill these conditions (also see the discussion of derivative
responsibility in
 <a href="#RespForOutc">&sect;3.5</a>).
 For example, a person may be so intoxicated that they lack control
over, or awareness of, their behavior, and yet it may still be
appropriate to hold them responsible for their intoxicated behavior
insofar as they freely intoxicated themselves. The tracing strategy
plays an important role in many accounts of responsibility (see, e.g.,
Fischer and Ravizza 1998, 49&ndash;51), but it has also been subjected
to important criticisms (see Vargas 2005; for a reply see Fischer and
Tognazzini 2009; for more on tracing, see Khoury 2012, King 2011, and
Shabo 2015).</p>

<p>
Various strategies for rejecting the above skeptical argument also
illustrate stances one can take on the relationship between knowledge
and responsibility. These strategies typically involve rejecting the
claim that knowing wrongdoing is fundamental to blameworthiness. It
has, for example, been argued that it is often morally blameworthy to
perform an action when one is merely <em>uncertain</em> whether the
action is wrong (see Guerrero 2007; also see Nelkin and Rickless 2017b
and Robichaud 2014). Another strategy would be to argue that
blameworthiness can be grounded in cases of morally ignorant
wrongdoing if it is reasonable to expect the wrongdoer to have avoided
their moral ignorance, and particularly if their ignorance is itself
caused by the agent&rsquo;s own epistemic and moral vices (FitzPatrick
2008 and 2017). Relatedly, it might be argued that one who is unaware
that they do wrong is blameworthy if they possessed relevant
capacities for avoiding their ignorance; this approach may be
particularly promising in cases in which an agent&rsquo;s lack of
moral awareness stems from a failure to remember their moral duties
(Clarke 2014, 2017 and Sher 2006, 2009; also see Rudy-Hiller 2017).
Finally, it might simply be claimed that morally ignorant wrongdoers
can harbor, and express through their behavior, objectionable
attitudes or qualities of will that suffice for blameworthiness
(Arpaly 2003, Bj&ouml;rnsson 2017a, Harman 2011, Mason 2015). This
approach may be most promising in cases in which a wrongdoer is aware
of the material outcomes of their conduct but unaware of the fact that
they do wrong in bringing about those outcomes.</p>

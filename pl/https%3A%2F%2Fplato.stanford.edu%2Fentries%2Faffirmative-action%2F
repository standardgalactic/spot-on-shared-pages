<h1>Affirmative Action</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Dec 28, 2001; substantive revision Fri Jun 21, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
&ldquo;Affirmative action&rdquo; means positive steps taken to
increase the representation of women and minorities in areas of
employment, education, and culture from which they have been
historically excluded. When those steps involve <em>preferential</em>
selection&mdash;selection on the basis of race, gender, or
ethnicity&mdash;affirmative action generates intense controversy.</p>

<p>
The ebb and flow of public controversy over affirmative action can be
pictured as three spikes on a line, the first spike representing a
period of passionate debate that began around 1972 and tapered off
after 1980, and the second indicating a resurgence of debate in the
1990s leading up to Supreme Court&rsquo;s decisions in 2003 and 2016
upholding certain kinds of affirmative action in higher education. The
third spike reflects the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision in 2023
voiding race-conscious-programs at Harvard and the University of North
Carolina, potentially opening a new era of conflict.</p>

<p>
The first spike encompassed controversy about gender and racial/ethnic
preferences alike. This is because in the beginning affirmative action
was largely about the factory, the firehouse, the office, and the
classroom podium. The second and third spikes represent a quarrel
about race and ethnicity. This is because the debate at the turn of
the twentieth-first century focused on college admissions. At
selective colleges, women need no boost; African-Americans and
Hispanics seemingly
 do.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 The first part of this entry looks at affirmative action&rsquo;s
origins in the employment context. The longer second part concentrates
on the college admissions controversy.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="Begi">1. In the Beginning</h2>

<p>
In 1972, affirmative action became an inflammatory public issue. True
enough, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 made something called
&ldquo;affirmative action&rdquo; a remedy federal courts could impose
on violators of the Act. Likewise, after 1965 federal contractors fell
subject to President Lyndon Johnson&rsquo;s Executive Order 11246,
requiring them to take &ldquo;affirmative action&rdquo; to make sure
they were not discriminating in their employment practices. But what
did this 1965 mandate amount to? The Executive Order assigned to the
Secretary of Labor the job of specifying rules of implementation. In
the meantime, as the federal courts were enforcing the Civil Rights
Act against discriminating companies, unions, and other institutions,
the Department of Labor mounted ad hoc attacks on the construction
industry by cajoling, threatening, negotiating, and generally
strong-arming reluctant construction firms into a series of
region-wide &ldquo;plans&rdquo; in which they committed themselves to
numerical hiring goals. Through these contractor commitments, the
Department could indirectly pressure recalcitrant labor unions, who
supplied the employees at job sites, to desegregate.</p>

<p>
While the occasional court case and government initiative made the
news and stirred some controversy, affirmative action was pretty far
down the list of public excitements until the autumn of 1972, when the
Secretary of Labor&rsquo;s Revised Order No. 4, fully implementing the
Executive Order, landed on campus by way of directives from the
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The Revised
Order&rsquo;s predecessor, Order No. 4, first promulgated in 1970,
cast a wide net over American institutions, both public and private.
By extending to all contractors the basic apparatus of the
construction industry &ldquo;plans,&rdquo; the Order imposed a
one-size-fits-all system of &ldquo;underutilization analyses,&rdquo;
&ldquo;goals,&rdquo; and &ldquo;timetables&rdquo; on hospitals, banks,
trucking companies, steel mills, printers, airlines&mdash;indeed, on
all the scores of thousands of institutions, large and small, that did
business with the government, including a special set of institutions
with a particularly voluble and articulate constituency, namely,
American universities.</p>

<p>
At first, university administrators and faculty found the demands of
Order No. 4 murky but hardly a threat to the established order. The
number of racial and ethnic minorities receiving PhDs each year and
thus eligible for faculty jobs was tiny. Any mandate to increase their
representation on campus would require more diligent searches by
universities, to be sure, but searches fated nevertheless largely to
mirror past results. The 1972 Revised Order, on the other hand,
effected a change that punctured any campus complacency: it included
women among the &ldquo;protected classes&rdquo; whose
&ldquo;underutilization&rdquo; demanded the setting of
&ldquo;goals&rdquo; and &ldquo;timetables&rdquo; for &ldquo;full
utilization&rdquo; (Graham 1990, 413). Unlike African-Americans and
Hispanics, women were getting PhDs in substantial and growing numbers.
If the affirmative action required of federal contractors was a recipe
for &ldquo;proportional representation,&rdquo; then Revised Order No.
4 was bound to leave a large footprint on campus. Some among the
professoriate exploded in a fury of opposition to the new rules, while
others responded with an equally vehement defense of
 them.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
As it happened, these events coincided with another development,
namely the &ldquo;public turn&rdquo; in philosophy. For several
decades Anglo-American philosophy had treated moral and political
questions obliquely. On the prevailing view, philosophers were suited
only to do &ldquo;conceptual analysis&rdquo;&mdash;they could lay
bare, for example, the conceptual architecture of the idea of justice,
but they were not competent to suggest political principles,
constitutional arrangements, or social policies that actually did
justice. Philosophers might do &ldquo;meta-ethics&rdquo; but not
&ldquo;normative ethics.&rdquo; This view collapsed in the 1970s under
the weight of two counter-blows. First, John Rawls published in 1971
<em>A Theory of Justice</em>, an elaborate, elegant, and inspiring
defense of a <em>normative</em> theory of justice (Rawls 1971).
Second, in the same year <em>Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs</em>,
with Princeton University&rsquo;s impeccable pedigree, began life, a
few months after Florida State&rsquo;s <em>Social Theory and
Practice</em>. These journals, along with a re-tooled older
periodical, <em>Ethics</em>, became self-conscious platforms for
socially and politically engaged philosophical writing, born out of
the feeling that in time of war (the Vietnam War) and social tumult
(the Civil Rights Movement, Women&rsquo;s Liberation), philosophers
ought to engage with real issues, not merely talk about words and
concepts. In 1973, <em>Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs</em> published
Thomas Nagel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Equal Treatment and Compensatory
Justice&rdquo; (Nagel 1973) and Judith Jarvis Thomson&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Preferential Hiring&rdquo; (Thomson 1973), and the
philosophical literature on affirmative action burgeoned
 forth.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
In contention was the nature of those &ldquo;goals&rdquo; and
&ldquo;timetables&rdquo; imposed on every contractor by Revised Order
No. 4. Weren&rsquo;t the &ldquo;goals&rdquo; tantamount to
&ldquo;quotas,&rdquo; requiring institutions to use racial or gender
preferences in their selection processes? Some answered
&ldquo;no&rdquo; (Ezorsky 1977, 86). Properly understood, affirmative
action did not require (or even permit) the use of gender or racial
preferences. Others said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; (Goldman 1976,
182&ndash;3). Affirmative action, if it did not impose preferences
outright, at least countenanced them. Among the yea-sayers, opinion
divided between those who said preferences were morally permissible
and those who said they were not. Within the &ldquo;morally
permissible&rdquo; set, different writers put forward different
justifications.</p>

<h2 id="ContEnga">2. The Controversy Engaged</h2>

<p>
The essays by Thomson and Nagel defended the use of preferences but on
different grounds. Thomson endorsed job preferences for women and
minorities as a form of redress for their past exclusion from the
workplace. Preferential policies, in her view, worked a kind of
justice. Nagel, by contrast, argued that preferences might work a kind
of social good, and without doing violence to justice. Institutions
could for one or another compelling reason properly depart from
standard meritocratic selection criteria because the whole system of
tying economic reward to earned credentials was itself
indefensible.</p>

<p>
Justice and desert lay at the heart of subsequent arguments. Several
writers took to task Thomson&rsquo;s argument that preferential hiring
justifiably makes up for past wrongs. Preferential hiring seen as
redress looks perverse, they contended, since it benefits individuals
(minorities and women possessing good educational credentials) least
likely harmed by past wrongs while it burdens individuals (younger
white male applicants) least likely to be responsible for past wrongs
(Simon 1974, 315&ndash;19; Sher 1975, 162; Sher 1979, 81&ndash;82; and
Goldman 1976,
 190&ndash;1).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 Instead of doing justice, contended the critics, preferential
treatment violated rights. What rights were at issue? The right of an
applicant &ldquo;to equal consideration&rdquo; (Thomson 1973, 377;
Simon 1974, 312), the right of the maximally competent to an open
position (Goldman 1976, 191; Goldman 1979, 24&ndash;8), or the right
of everyone to equal opportunity (Gross 1977a, 382; Gross 1978, 97).
Moreover, according to the critics, preferential treatment confounded
desert by severing reward from a &ldquo;person&rsquo;s character,
talents, choices and abilities&rdquo; (Simon 1979, 96), by
&ldquo;subordinating merit, conduct, and character to race&rdquo;
(Eastland and Bennett 1979, 144), and by disconnecting outcomes from
actual liability and damage (Gross 1978, 125&ndash;42).</p>

<p>
Defenders of preferences were no less quick to enlist justice and
desert in their cause. Mary Anne Warren, for example, argued that in a
context of entrenched gender discrimination, gender preferences might
improve the &ldquo;overall fairness&rdquo; of job selections. Justice
and individual desert need not be violated.</p>

<blockquote>
If individual men&rsquo;s careers are temporarily set back because
of&hellip;[job preferences given to women], the odds are good that
these same men will have benefited in the past and/or will benefit in
the future&mdash;not necessarily in the job competition, but in some
ways&mdash;from sexist discrimination against women. Conversely, if
individual women receive apparently unearned bonuses [through
preferential selection], it is highly likely that these same women
will have suffered in the past and/or will suffer in the future
from&hellip;sexist attitudes. (Warren 1977, 256)
</blockquote>

<p>
Likewise, James Rachels defended racial preferences as devices to
neutralize unearned advantages by whites. Given the pervasiveness of
racial discrimination, it is likely, he argued, that the superior
credentials offered by white applicants do not reflect their greater
effort, desert, or even ability. Rather, the credentials reflect their
mere luck at being born white. &ldquo;Some white&hellip;[applicants]
have better qualifications&hellip;only because they have not had to
contend with the obstacles faced by their African-American
competitors&rdquo; (Rachels 1978, 162). Rachels was less confident
than Warren that preferences worked uniformly accurate offsets.
Preferences might do injustice to some whites; yet their absence would
result in injustices to African-Americans who have been unfairly
handicapped by their lesser advantages.</p>

<p>
Rachels&rsquo; diffidence was warranted in light of the
counter-responses. If racial and gender preferences for jobs were
supposed to neutralize unfair competitive advantages, they needed to
be calibrated to fit the variety of backgrounds aspirants brought to
any competition for these goods. Simply giving blanket preferences to
blacks or women seemed much too ham-handed an approach if the point
was to micro-distribute opportunities fairly (Sher 1975, 165ff).</p>

<h2 id="RighCons">3. Rights and Consistency</h2>

<p>
To many of its critics, &ldquo;reverse discrimination&rdquo; was
simply incoherent. When &ldquo;the employers and the schools
<em>favor</em> women and blacks,&rdquo; objected Lisa Newton, they
commit the same injustice perpetrated by Jim Crow discrimination.
&ldquo;Just as the previous discrimination did, this reverse
discrimination violates the public equality which defines
citizenship&rdquo; (Newton 1973,
 310).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
William Bennett and Terry Eastland likewise saw racial preferences as
in some sense illogical:</p>

<blockquote>
To count by race, to use the means of numerical equality to achieve
the end of moral equality, is counterproductive, for to count by race
is to deny the end by virtue of the means. The means of race counting
will not, cannot, issue in an end where race does not matter (Eastland
and Bennett 1979,
 149).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
 </blockquote>

<p>
When Eastland and Bennett alluded to those who favored using race to
get to a point where race doesn&rsquo;t count, they had in mind
specifically the Supreme Court&rsquo;s Justice Blackmun who, in the
famous 1978 <em>Bakke</em> case (discussed below), put his own view in
just those simple terms. For Blackmun, the legitimacy of racial
preferences was to be measured by how fast using them moves us toward
a society where race doesn&rsquo;t matter (a view developed in subtle
detail by Richard Wasserstrom in Wasserstrom 1976). While the critics
of preferences claimed to find the very idea of using race to end
racism illogical and incoherent, they also fell back on principle to
block Blackmun&rsquo;s instrumental defense should it actually prove
both reasonable and plausible. &ldquo;The moral issue comes in classic
form,&rdquo; wrote Carl Cohen. &ldquo;Terribly important
objectives&hellip;appear to require impermissible means.&rdquo; He
went on to ask, &ldquo;might we not wink at the Constitution this
once&rdquo; and allow preferences to do their good work (Cohen 1995,
20)? Neither he nor other critics thought so. Principle must hold
firm. &ldquo;[I]n the distribution of benefits under the laws
<em>all</em> racial classifications are invidious&rdquo; (Cohen 1995,
52).</p>

<p>
But what, exactly, <em>is</em> the principle&mdash;constitutional or
moral&mdash;that always bars the use of race as a means to
&ldquo;terribly important objectives&rdquo;? Alan Goldman did more
than anyone in the early debate to formulate and ground a relevant
principle. Using a contractualist framework, he surmised that rational
contractors would choose a rule of justice requiring positions to be
awarded by competence. On its face, this rule would seem to preclude
filling positions by reference to factors like race and gender that
are unrelated to competence. However, Goldman&rsquo;s
&ldquo;rule&rdquo; blocked preferences only under certain empirical
conditions. Goldman explained the derivation of the rule and its
consequent <em>limit</em> this way:</p>

<blockquote>
The rule for hiring the most competent was justified as part of a
right to equal opportunity to succeed through socially productive
effort, and on grounds of increased welfare for all members of
society. Since it is justified in relation to a right to equal
opportunity, and since the application of the rule may simply compound
injustices when opportunities are unequal elsewhere in the system, the
creation of more equal opportunities takes precedence when in conflict
with the rule for awarding positions. Thus short-run violations of the
rule are justified to create a more just distribution of benefits by
applying the rule itself in future years (Goldman 1979,
164&ndash;165).
</blockquote>

<p>
In other words, if &ldquo;terribly important objectives&rdquo; having
to do with equalizing opportunities in a system rife with unjust
inequalities could in fact be furthered by measured and targeted
&ldquo;reverse discrimination,&rdquo; justice wouldn&rsquo;t stand in
the way. Goldman&rsquo;s principle did not have the adamantine
character Cohen and other critics sought in a bar to preferences.
Where can such an unyielding principle be found? In the next two
sections I examine different efforts to answer this question.</p>

<h2 id="RealWorlAffiActiWork">4. The Campus Wars</h2>

<p>
In the 1970s, while campuses were embroiled in debate about how to
increase blacks, Hispanics, and women on the faculty, universities
were also putting into effect schemes to increase minority presence
within the student body. Very selective universities, in particular,
needed new initiatives because only a handful of African-American and
Hispanic high school students possessed test scores and grades good
enough to make them eligible for admission. These institutions faced a
choice: retain their admissions criteria unchanged and live with the
upshot&mdash;hardly any African-Americans and Hispanics on
campus&mdash;or fiddle with their criteria to get a more substantial
representation. Most elected the second path.</p>

<p>
The Medical School of the University of California at Davis
exemplified a particularly aggressive approach. It reserved sixteen of
the one hundred slots in its entering classes for minorities. In 1973
and again in 1974, Allan Bakke, a white applicant, was denied
admission although his test scores and grades were better than most or
all of those admitted through the special program. He sued. In 1977,
his case, <em>Regents of the University of California v. Bakke</em>,
reached the Supreme Court. The Court rendered its decision a year
later (<em>Bakke</em> 1978).</p>

<p>
An attentive reader of Title VI of the Civil Rights
Act&mdash;&ldquo;[N]o person&hellip;shall, on the ground of race,
color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be
denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any
program or activity receiving Federal financial
assistance&rdquo;&mdash;might have thought this case was an easy call.
So, too, thought four Justices on the Court, who voted to order Bakke
admitted to the Medical School. Led by Justice Stevens, they saw the
racially segregated, two-track scheme at the Medical School (a
recipient of federal funds) as a clear violation of the plain language
of the Title.</p>

<p>
Four other members of the Court, led by Justice Brennan, wanted very
keenly to save the Medical School program. To find a more attractive
terrain for doing battle, they made an end-run around Title VI,
arguing that, whatever its language, it had no independent meaning
itself. It meant in regard to race only what the Constitution meant.
Thus, instead of having to parse the stingy and unyielding language of
Title VI (&ldquo;no person shall be subjected to&hellip;on the ground
of race&rdquo;), the Brennan group could turn their creative energies
to interpreting the broad and vague language of the Fourteenth
Amendment (&ldquo;no person shall be denied the equal protection of
the laws&rdquo;), which provided much more wiggle-room for justifying
racial preferences. The Brennan Justices persuaded one other member,
Justice Powell, to join them in their view of Title VI. But Powell
didn&rsquo;t agree with their view of the Constitution. He argued that
the Medical School&rsquo;s policy was unconstitutional and voted that
Bakke must be admitted. His vote, added to the four votes of the
Stevens group, meant that Allan Bakke won his case and that Powell got
to write the opinion of the Court. The Brennan strategy didn&rsquo;t
reap the fruit it intended.</p>

<p>
Against the leanings of the Brennan group, who would distinguish
between &ldquo;benign&rdquo; and &ldquo;malign&rdquo; uses of race and
deal more leniently with the former, Powell insisted that the
Fourteenth Amendment&rsquo;s promise of &ldquo;equal protection of the
law&rdquo; must mean the same thing for all, black and white alike. To
paraphrase Powell:</p>

<blockquote>
The Constitution can tolerate no &ldquo;two-class&rdquo; theory of
equal protection. There is no principled basis for deciding between
classes that deserve special judicial attention and those that
don&rsquo;t. To think otherwise would involve the Court in making all
kinds of &ldquo;political&rdquo; decisions it is not competent to
make. In expounding the Constitution, the Court&rsquo;s role is to
discern &ldquo;principles sufficiently absolute to give them roots
throughout the community and continuity over significant periods of
time, and to lift them above the pragmatic political judgments of a
particular time and place&rdquo; (<em>Bakke</em> 1978, 295&ndash;300
[Powell quoting Cox 1976, 114]).
</blockquote>

<p>
What, then, was the practical meaning of a &ldquo;sufficiently
absolute&rdquo; rendering of the principle of equal protection? It was
this: when the decisions of state agents &ldquo;touch upon an
individual&rsquo;s race or ethnic background, he is entitled to a
judicial determination that the burden he is asked to bear on that
basis is precisely tailored to serve a compelling governmental
interest&rdquo; (<em>Bakke</em> 1978, 300).</p>

<p>
Powell, with this standard in hand, then turned to look at the four
reasons the Medical School offered for its special program: (i) to
reduce &ldquo;the historic deficit of traditionally disfavored
minorities in medical schools and the medical profession;&rdquo; (ii)
to counter &ldquo;the effects of societal discrimination;&rdquo; (iii)
to increase &ldquo;the number of physicians who will practice in
communities currently underserved;&rdquo; and (iv) to obtain
&ldquo;the educational benefits that flow from an ethnically diverse
student body&rdquo; (<em>Bakke</em> 1978, 307). Did any or all of them
specify a compelling governmental interest? Did they necessitate use
of racial preferences?</p>

<p>
As to the first reason, Powell dismissed it out of hand.</p>

<blockquote>
If [the School&rsquo;s] purpose is to assure within its student body
some specified percentage of a particular group merely because of its
race or ethnic origin, such a preferential purpose must be rejected
not as insubstantial but as facially invalid. Preferring members of
any one group for no reason other than race or ethnic origin is
discrimination for its own sake.
</blockquote>

<p>
As to the second reason, Powell allowed it more force. A state has a
legitimate interest in ameliorating the effects of past
discrimination. Even so, contended Powell, the Court,</p>

<blockquote>
has never approved a classification that aids persons perceived as
members of relatively victimized groups at the expense of other
innocent individuals in the absence of judicial, legislative, or
administrative findings of constitutional or statutory violations
(<em>Bakke</em> 1978, 308).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
And the Medical School does not purport to have made, and is in no
position to make, such findings. Its broad mission is education, not
the formulation of any legislative policy or the adjudication of
particular claims of illegality.&hellip;[I]solated segments of our
vast governmental structures are not competent to make those
decisions, at least in the absence of legislative mandates and
legislatively determined criteria (<em>Bakke</em> 1978, 309).
</blockquote>

<p>
As to the third reason, Powell found it, too, insufficient. The
Medical School provided no evidence that the best way it could
contribute to increased medical services to underserved communities
was to employ a racially preferential admissions scheme. Indeed, the
Medical School provided no evidence that its scheme would result in
any benefits at all to such communities (<em>Bakke</em> 1978,
311).</p>

<p>
This left the fourth reason. Here Powell found merit. A
university&rsquo;s interest in a diverse student body is legitimated
by the First Amendment&rsquo;s implied protection of academic freedom.
This constitutional halo makes the interest &ldquo;compelling.&rdquo;
However, the Medical School&rsquo;s use of a racial and ethnic
classification scheme was not &ldquo;precisely tailored&rdquo; to
effect the School&rsquo;s interest in diversity, argued Powell.</p>

<blockquote>
The diversity that furthers a compelling state interest encompasses a
far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which
racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element. [The
Medical School&rsquo;s] special admissions program, focused solely on
ethnic diversity, would hinder rather than further attainment of
genuine diversity (<em>Bakke</em>1978, 316).
</blockquote>

<p>
The diversity which provides an educational atmosphere
&ldquo;conducive to speculation, experiment and creation&rdquo;
includes a nearly endless range of experiences, talents, and
attributes that students might bring to campus. In reducing diversity
to racial and ethnic quotas, the Medical School wholly misconceived
this important educational interest.</p>

<p>
In sum, although the last of the Medical School&rsquo;s four reasons
encompassed a &ldquo;compelling governmental interest,&rdquo; the
School&rsquo;s special admissions program was not necessary to effect
the interest. The special admissions program was unconstitutional. So
concluded Justice Powell.</p>

<h2 id="EquaRule">5. Equality&rsquo;s Rule</h2>

<p>
This was a conclusion Justice Brennan tried vigorously to forestall.
Brennan agreed with Powell that &ldquo;equal protection&rdquo; must
mean the same thing&mdash;that is, remain one rule&mdash;whether
applied to blacks or whites. But the same rule applied to different
circumstances need not yield the same results. Racial preferences
created for different reasons and producing different outcomes need
not all be judged in the same harsh, virtually fatal, manner. This
point was the crux of Brennan&rsquo;s defense of the Medical
School&rsquo;s policy.</p>

<p>
Powell thought there was no principled way to distinguish
&ldquo;benign&rdquo; from &ldquo;malign&rdquo; discrimination, but
Brennan insisted there was. He argued that if the Court looked
carefully at its past cases striking down Jim Crow laws, it would see
the principle at work. What the Court found wrong in Jim Crow was that
it served no purpose except to mark out and stigmatize one group of
people as inferior. The &ldquo;cardinal principle&rdquo; operating in
the Court&rsquo;s decisions condemned racial classifications
&ldquo;drawn on the presumption that one race is inferior to
another&rdquo; or that &ldquo;put the weight of government behind
racial hatred and separation&rdquo; (<em>Bakke</em>,1978, 358
[Brennan, dissenting]). Brennan agreed with Powell that no public
racial classification motivated by racial animus, no classification
whose purpose is to stigmatize people with the &ldquo;badge of
inferiority,&rdquo; could withstand judicial scrutiny. However, the
Medical School&rsquo;s policy, even if ill-advised or mistaken,
reflected a public purpose far different from that found in Jim Crow.
The policy ought not be treated as though it were cut from the same
cloth.</p>

<p>
Brennan granted that if a state adopted a racial classification for
the purpose of humiliating whites, or stigmatizing Allan Bakke as
inferior and confining him to second-class citizenship, that
classification would be as odious as Jim Crow. But the Medical
School&rsquo;s policy had neither this purpose nor this effect. Allan
Bakke may have been upset and resentful at losing out under the
special plan, but he wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;in any sense stamped as an
inferior by the Medical School&rsquo;s rejection of him.&rdquo; Nor
did his loss constitute a &ldquo;pervasive injury,&rdquo; in the sense
that wherever he went he would be treated as a &ldquo;second-class
citizen&rdquo; because of his color (<em>Bakke</em> 1978, 376
[Brennan, dissenting]).</p>

<p>
In short, argued Brennan, the principle expressed in the Equal
Protection Clause should be viewed as an <em>anti-caste
principle</em>, a principle that uniformly and consistently rejects
<em>all</em> public law whose purpose is to subject people to an
inferior and degraded station in life, whether they are black or
 white.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 Of course, given the asymmetrical position of whites and blacks in
our country, we are not likely to encounter laws that try to
stigmatize whites as an inferior caste (much less succeed at it). But
this merely shows that a principle applied to different circumstances
produces different results. Because the Medical School&rsquo;s program
sought to undo the effects of a racial caste system long-enduring in
America, it represented a purpose of great social importance and
should not be found constitutionally infirm: so maintained Brennan
(<em>Bakke</em> 1978, 363 [Brennan, dissenting]).</p>

<p>
Justice Powell never successfully engaged this way of reading
&ldquo;constitutional equality.&rdquo; His insistence on clear, plain,
unitary, absolute principle did not cut against the Brennan view. The
issue between Powell and Brennan was not the consistency and
stringency of the principle but its content. If the Constitution says,
&ldquo;The state cannot deliberately burden someone by race <em>if its
purpose is to create or maintain caste</em>,&rdquo; then
constitutional law doesn&rsquo;t block any of the Medical
School&rsquo;s justifications.</p>

<p>
If we turn away from exegesis of the Constitution, are we likely to
find in political theory itself any principle of equality implying
that <em>every</em> use of racial preferences in <em>every</em>
circumstance works an intolerable injustice?</p>

<p>
The prospects seem dim. Won&rsquo;t very general notions of equality
lend themselves <em>both</em> to defending affirmative action (and the
social inclusion it effects) as well as condemning it (and the racial
non&ndash;neutrality it involves)? The challenge here is
well-illustrated by Carl Cohen&rsquo;s effort, in a debate with James
Sterba, to extract a strict prohibition on racial preferences from the
Aristotelian principle that &ldquo;equals should be treated
equally&rdquo; (Cohen and Sterba 2003, 23). This principle, urges
Cohen, &ldquo;certainly entails at least this: It is wrong, always and
everywhere, to give special advantage to any group simply on the basis
of physical characteristics that have no relevance to the award given
or the burden imposed&rdquo; (Cohen and Sterba 2003, 25). Whether
anything interesting follows from this proposition depends on how we
construe &ldquo;relevance.&rdquo; Cohen admits that public policy may
rightly treat some people differently because of their physical
characteristics. For example, the state might offer special assistance
to the old or disabled. Now, this example lends itself to the thought
that the relevance of physical differences is something independent of
social policy. Age and disability, it seems, are real features of
persons and public policy simply tracks them. However, the
relevance that differences have is not something itself
given by nature; it is determined by public purposes. Age and
disability are <em>made</em> relevant in this manner&mdash;in the one
case, by the social purpose of assuring that people do not have to
live in poverty when they can no longer work; in the other case, by
the social purpose of assuring that people are not foreclosed from
developing and marketing their talents by impediments in the (largely
constructed) physical environment.</p>

<p>
Purpose determines relevancy, and this is true whether or not the
relevant differences are physical. If the nation thinks it desirable
to change white institutions so that they are less uniformly white,
that purpose links skin color to recruitment.</p>

<p>
Because the Aristotelian principle by itself doesn&rsquo;t rule out
racial preferences (since blacks and whites may be relevantly
different with respect to certain legitimate public purposes), it is
not surprising that Cohen also invokes a substantive conception of
equality: &ldquo;All members of humankind are equally ends in
themselves, all have equal dignity&mdash;and therefore all are
entitled to equal respect from the community and its laws&rdquo;
(Cohen and Sterba, 24). This principle, however, brings us back to the
interpretive questions about &ldquo;equal protection of the
laws&rdquo; played out in the Powell-Brennan exchange in
<em>Bakke</em>. What do &ldquo;equal dignity&rdquo; and &ldquo;equal
respect&rdquo; mean?</p>

<p>
In a series of essays beginning in the 1970s, Ronald Dworkin marked
out and developed a view of equality that generalized elements of the
Brennan argument in <em>Bakke</em>. He emphasized a distinction
between &ldquo;two different sorts of rights&hellip;the right to
<em>equal treatment</em>&hellip;[and] the <em>right to treatment as an
equal</em>.&rdquo; The latter &ldquo;is the right&hellip; to be
treated with the same respect and concern as anyone else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
In some cases (voting, for example) equal treatment applies:
government must treat every eligible voter the same. In other
contexts, however, government distinguishes among groups and
individuals in making policy for the common good (marking differences
between the young and old in the example noted above). In this
classifying process, &ldquo;[a]n individual&rsquo;s right to be
treated as an equal means that his potential loss must be treated as a
matter of concern, but that loss may nevertheless be outweighed by the
gain to the community&rdquo; (Dworkin 1977, 227). Treating the
individual&rsquo;s loss &ldquo;as a matter of concern&rdquo; means
that the ingredients which go into making public policy cannot include
public contempt or hatred toward the individual (and the group of
which he/she is a member).</p>

<blockquote>
Every citizen has a constitutional right that he not suffer
disadvantage, at least in the competition for any public benefit,
because the race or religion or region or other artificial group to
which he belongs is the subject of prejudice or contempt (Dworkin
1985, 300&ndash;301).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The equal protection clause is violated, not whenever some group has
lost an important decision on the merits of the case or through
politics, but when its loss results from its special vulnerability to
prejudice or hostility or stereotype and its consequent diminished
standing&hellip;in the political community. The clause does not
guarantee each citizen that he will benefit equally from every
political decision; it guarantees him only that he will be treated as
an equal&mdash;with equal concern and respect&mdash;in the political
processes and deliberations that produce those decisions (Dworkin
2000, 411).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
It is true that the equal protection clause lays down a general
principle of political morality, and that its contemporary
interpreters must remain faithful to that general principle. If racial
classifications were inherently morally wrong, then they might well be
deemed unconstitutional for that reason. But&hellip;racial
classifications are not inherently wrong, any more than other
classifications based on physical or genetically grounded properties
(Dworkin 2000, 417; footnote omitted).
</blockquote>

<p>
Carl Cohen disagreed (Cohen 1995, 47). But he never specified a
conception of equality in which bearing unequal burdens on behalf of
urgent social ends <em>invariably</em> amounts to an assault on
dignity if the burden happens to be assigned by race. He insisted
(like Lisa Newton above) that &ldquo;[u]sing race to award benefits
now does injustice in precisely the same way injustice was done
originally [to blacks], by giving moral weight to skin color
itself.&rdquo; But comparing affirmative action to Jim Crow
can&rsquo;t be right, unless the purpose and effects of a policy have
no bearing on its moral
 standing.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h2 id="DiveDomi">6. Diversity&rsquo;s Dominion</h2>

<p>
How, if it held the Medical School&rsquo;s policy unconstitutional,
did Justice Powell&rsquo;s <em>Bakke</em> opinion become the basis
upon which universities across the land enacted&mdash;or
maintained&mdash;racially preferential admissions policies?</p>

<p>
If Powell had concluded with his assessment of the Medical
School&rsquo;s four justifications, <em>Bakke</em> would have left
university affirmative action in a precarious situation. However, he
didn&rsquo;t stop there. In an earlier ruling on Bakke&rsquo;s
lawsuit, the California Supreme Court had forbidden the Medical School
to make any use of race or ethnicity in its admissions decisions.
Powell thought this went too far. Given higher education&rsquo;s
protected interest in &ldquo;diversity,&rdquo; and given that a
student&rsquo;s race or ethnicity <em>might</em> add to diversity just
in the same way that her age, work experience, family background,
special talents, foreign language fluency, athletic prowess, military
service, and unusual accomplishments might, Powell vacated that
portion of the California Supreme Court&rsquo;s order.</p>

<p>
Then he added some dicta for guidance. If universities want to
understand diversity and the role that race and ethnicity might play
in achieving it, they should look to Harvard, proposed Powell, and he
appended to his opinion a long statement of Harvard&rsquo;s
affirmative action admissions program. In such a program, Powell
contended, racial or ethnic background might</p>

<blockquote>
be deemed a &ldquo;plus&rdquo; in a particular applicant&rsquo;s file,
yet it does not insulate the individual from comparison with all other
candidates for the available seats.&hellip;This kind of program treats
each applicant as an individual in the admissions process. The
applicant who loses out on the last available seat to another
candidate receiving a &ldquo;plus&rdquo; on the basis of ethnic
background will not have been foreclosed from all consideration for
that seat simply because he was not the right color or had the wrong
surname. It would mean only that his combined
qualifications&hellip;did not outweigh those of the other applicant.
His qualifications would have been weighed fairly and competitively,
and he would have had no basis to complain of unequal treatment under
the Fourteenth Amendment (<em>Bakke</em>, at 318, 319).
</blockquote>

<p>
In these off-hand comments, universities saw a green light for pushing
ahead aggressively with their affirmative action programs. Justice
Powell&rsquo;s basic holding could not have been plainer: any system
like the Medical School&rsquo;s that assessed applications along two
different tracks defined by race or that used numerical racial quotas
must fail constitutional muster. Yet by the mid-1980s universities
across the land had in place systems of admissions and scholarship
programs that exhibited one or both of these features. When the
University of Maryland&rsquo;s Banneker scholarships&mdash;awarded
only to African-American students&mdash;were held in violation of the
Constitution in 1994, the house of cards forming university
affirmative action began to fall (<em>Podberesky v. Kirwan</em> 1994).
In 1996, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit struck down the
University of Texas Law School&rsquo;s two-track admissions program
(<em>Hopwood v. Texas</em> 1996). In 1998, the Court of Appeals for
the First Circuit struck down a Boston plan assigning students to
selective high schools by race (<em>Wessman v. Gitten</em>s 1998). In
2001, two more schools saw their admissions programs invalidated by
federal courts: the University of Georgia (<em>Johnson v. Board of
Regents</em> 2001) and the University of Michigan Law School
(<em>Grutter v. Bollinger</em> 2001). In many of these cases,
educational institutions were using schemes that made race something
very much more than Justice Powell&rsquo;s &ldquo;plus&rdquo;
 factor.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup>
 The Fifth Circuit Court&rsquo;s ruling in the University of Texas
case (<em>Hopwood v. Texas</em> 1996) threw a cloud even over
Powell&rsquo;s small window for affirmative action, boldly asserting
that the <em>Bakke</em> holding was now dead as law and that race
could not be used at all in admissions.</p>

<p>
Given Justice Powell&rsquo;s singular opinion, supported by no one
else on the Court, and given the drift of Supreme Court decisions on
racial preferences since
 1978,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>
 the <em>Hopwood</em> court was not outlandish, if a bit presumptuous,
in declaring Powell&rsquo;s holding in <em>Bakke</em> dead. As it
happened, Powell&rsquo;s opinion was far from dead. In the University
of Michigan Law School case, <em>Grutter v. Bollinger</em>, eventually
decided by the Supreme Court in June 2003, Justice Sandra Day
O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s lead opinion declared: &ldquo;today we endorse
Justice Powell&rsquo;s view that student body diversity is a
compelling state interest that can justify the use of race in
university admissions&rdquo; (<em>Grutter</em> 2003, 330). Diversity
was alive after all. But how it worked its affirmative action elixir
remained as unclear in 2003 as it had been in 1978.</p>

<p>
To see why, consider how in <em>Grutter</em> Justice O&rsquo;Connor
posed the issue:</p>

<blockquote>
The [Law School&rsquo;s] policy aspires to &ldquo;achieve that
diversity which has the potential to enrich everyone&rsquo;s education
and thus make a law class stronger than the sum of its
parts.&rdquo;&hellip;The policy does not restrict the types of
diversity contributions eligible for substantial weight in the
admissions process, but instead recognizes &ldquo;many possible bases
for diversity admissions.&rdquo;&hellip;The policy does, however,
reaffirm the Law School&rsquo;s longstanding commitment to &ldquo;one
particular type of diversity,&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;racial and ethnic
diversity with special reference to the inclusion of students from
groups which have been historically discriminated against&rdquo;
(<em>Grutter</em> 2003, 325).
</blockquote>

<p>
Now, posing the issue this way and allowing the Law School to assert a
special interest in &ldquo;one particular type of diversity&rdquo;
invites the conflation of <em>general</em> diversity&mdash;a diversity
of opinions, experiences, backgrounds, talents, aspirations, and
perspectives&mdash;with <em>ethnic</em> and <em>racial</em> diversity
that Justice Powell appeared strongly to resist. Nevertheless, Justice
O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s went on:</p>

<blockquote>
We find that the Law School&rsquo;s admissions program bears the
hallmark of a narrowly tailored plan. As Justice Powell made clear in
<em>Bakke</em>, truly individualized consideration demands that race
be used in a flexible, non-mechanical way. It follows from this
mandate that universities cannot establish quotas for members of
certain racial groups (<em>Grutter</em> 2003, 334).
</blockquote>

<p>
What vindicated the Law School in O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s eyes was its
&ldquo;highly individualized, holistic review of each
applicant&rsquo;s file, giving serious consideration to all the ways
an applicant might contribute to a diverse educational
environment&rdquo; (<em>Grutter</em> 2003, at 339). This
&ldquo;individualized consideration&rdquo; is crucial; in <em>Gratz v.
Bollinger</em>, decided the same day as <em>Grutter</em>, Justice
O&rsquo;Connor switched sides to hold unconstitutional the
undergraduate admissions process at the University of Michigan. The
undergraduate admissions office operated differently than the Law
School. It computed an index score for each applicant by assigning
numerical points for academic factors such as high school grades,
admissions test scores, quality of high school, strength of
curriculum; and for nonacademic factors such as being a resident of
Michigan, a child of an alumnus, a recruited athlete, or a member of
&ldquo;an underrepresented minority group.&rdquo; An applicant falling
in this last category automatically received 20 points (<em>Gratz</em>
2003, 287). In O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s view, this
&ldquo;mechanical&rdquo; procedure meant that the undergraduate
admissions office did not fully take account in each application
&ldquo;of all factors that may contribute to student body
diversity&rdquo; (<em>Gratz</em> 2003, 288).</p>

<p>
But O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s conclusion here leaves a question hanging.
Why should the undergraduate admissions office take account of all the
factors that may contribute to student body if it especially wants to
select from certain parts of the diversity spectrum? Why can&rsquo;t
it, like the law school, claim a special interest in &ldquo;one
particular type of diversity&rdquo;?</p>

<p>
Moreover, why bar the undergraduate admissions office from using an
effective tool to promote its interest even if the tool is
&ldquo;mechanical&rdquo;? In fact, the Law School&rsquo;s
&ldquo;non-mechanical&rdquo; procedure differed from the undergraduate
admissions policy only on its face, not in its results. During
admissions season, the Law School&rsquo;s director of admissions
frequently consulted the &ldquo;daily reports&rdquo; that &ldquo;kept
track of the racial and ethnic composition&rdquo; of the incoming
class. He did so to make sure a &ldquo;critical mass&rdquo; of
minority students was included (<em>Grutter</em> 2003, 326). In short,
the Law School &ldquo;managed&rdquo; its admissions process so that
roughly 6 to 7 percent of each entering class was African-American.
The undergraduate admissions procedure, with its index scores, yielded
a similar outcome (<em>Grutter</em> 2003, 367&ndash;69 [Rehnquist,
dissenting] and 374 [Kennedy, dissenting]). Only surface appearance
distinguished the two procedures. Justice Scalia called the Law
School&rsquo;s &ldquo;holistic&rdquo; admissions process &ldquo;a
sham,&rdquo; and not without some reason (<em>Grutter</em> 2003, 375
[Scalia, dissenting]).</p>

<p>
As it turned out, <em>Grutter</em> failed to close the book on
university affirmative action. A new legal challenge soon arose, this
time against the University of Texas, which had revised its own
admissions program in 2004 to emulate the scheme validated in
<em>Grutter</em>. The case, <em>Fisher v. Texas</em>, wound its way
through the courts for a decade, twice landing on the steps of the
Supreme Court before final disposition in 2016.</p>

<p>
Justice Kennedy, writing for the Court, left the <em>Grutter</em>
defense of racial preferences intact, essentially retracing Justice
O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s opinion. Universities bent upon pursuing the
&ldquo;educational benefits that flow from student body
diversity,&rdquo; he wrote, are due a degree of judicial deference
(<em>Fisher</em> 2016, 2419).</p>

<blockquote>
The University explains that it strives to provide an &lsquo;academic
environment&rsquo; that offers a &lsquo;robust exchange of ideas,
exposure to differing cultures, preparation for the challenges of an
increasingly diverse workforce, and acquisition of competencies
required of future leaders.&rsquo; &hellip; All of these objectives
&hellip; mirror the &lsquo;compelling interest&rsquo; this Court has
approved in its prior cases (<em>Fisher</em> 2016, 2211).
</blockquote>

<p>
Persuaded that race&ndash;neutral policies didn&rsquo;t allow the
University fully to succeed in deriving the &ldquo;educational
benefits&rdquo; of diversity, the Court majority found the
University&rsquo;s modest use of race permissible.</p>

<p>
But despite these legal victories, have universities actually made a
case for diversity as the justifying basis for race&ndash;conscious
admissions? Caught napping in the mid&ndash;1990s when the legal
challenges began, higher education rushed to put meat on the
<em>Bakke</em> bones and turn Justice Powell&rsquo;s off&ndash;hand
remarks into a full&ndash;fledged defense. As the University of
Michigan cases approached a final test in 2003, the Supreme Court was
bombarded with scores of friend&ndash;of&ndash;the&ndash;court briefs
from business groups, military officers, higher education
associations, coteries of scholars, and other interested parties
lauding the benefits of diversity. A similar outpouring preceded the
decision in <em>Fisher</em>.</p>

<p>
Consider some of the claims in these briefs. &ldquo;[S]tudent body
diversity is <em>essential</em>&rdquo; if universities are to provide
students with &ldquo;skills necessary for&hellip;success in an
increasingly globalized world&rdquo; (Leading Public Research
Universities 2015, 11&ndash;12; emphasis added). Racial and ethnic
diversity on campus are &ldquo;<em>vital&rdquo;</em> to securing a
capable workforce; &ldquo;it is <em>essential</em> that [students] be
educated in an environment where they are exposed to diverse people,
ideas, perspectives, and interactions&rdquo; (65 Leading American
Businesses 2003, 1, 2; emphasis added). Otherwise, the education of
students is &ldquo;<em>degraded</em>&rdquo; (823 Social Scientists
2015, 5; emphasis added). &ldquo;[S]tudents today <em>must</em>
receive direct experience with people of different backgrounds&rdquo;
(American Council on Education 2015, 6; emphasis added). The
&ldquo;<em>only</em> means of obtaining properly qualified employees
is through diversity at institutions of higher
education&hellip;[Appropriate] skills can <em>only</em> be developed
through exposure to widely diverse people, culture, ideas, and
viewpoints&rdquo; (Fortune 100 and Other Leading Businesses 2013, 3,
5; emphasis added). &ldquo;Diversity is an <em>indispensable</em>
prerequisite to establishing the most productive problem&ndash;solving
groups&rdquo; (Social and Organizational Psychologists 2015, 47;
emphasis added).</p>

<p>
According to the briefs the positive effects of diversity are
bountiful. They include &ldquo;improvements in cognitive abilities,
analytical problem solving skills and complex thinking
skills&hellip;[C]ross racial interactions are more strongly linked
with cognitive growth than are interactions with non&ndash;racial
diversity&rdquo; (American Educational Research Association 2012, 12).
&ldquo;[R]esearch shows that by increasing diversity, universities can
help their graduates enter society with better problem&ndash;solving
capabilities than students who are not exposed to diversity&rdquo;
(Social and Organizational Psychologists 2015, 37).</p>

<p>
Now consider four points. First, the promiscuous use of
&ldquo;diversity&rdquo; in the argument for affirmative action opens
the door to waffling and equivocation. Students learn through
&ldquo;exposure to widely diverse people, culture, ideas, and
viewpoints&rdquo; announces the Fortune 100 brief. Of course. But the
issue at hand is <em>racial</em> diversity. Wrapping the latter into
the former is not an aid to
 precision.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup>
 Second, can we imagine that the University of Michigan or the
University of Texas would abandon its affirmative action program if
studies showed no particular educational benefit to diversity? Suppose
it turns out that students in general don&rsquo;t show additional
&ldquo;cognitive growth&rdquo; from increased racial diversity.
Suppose it turns out students would best prepare for our
&ldquo;increasingly globalized world&rdquo; by learning Mandarin
Chinese or Spanish.</p>

<p>
Third, the straining by academics to show that cross-racial
interaction is <em>essential</em>, <em>indispensable</em>,
<em>vital</em>, <em>necessary</em>, or <em>imperative</em> to a good
education, if taken at face value, leads to an unpleasant conclusion,
namely that a lot of black college students suffer a deficient
education. The young woman who excels at Dunbar High School in
Washington, DC (enrollment 95 % black, 1 % white) and then gets her
Bachelor of Science degree in statistics <em>magna cum laude</em> at
Spelman College (enrolling, in 2017, one white among its 2097
students) is, according to Fortune 100 companies, not the sort of
employee they want. Graduates of Fisk University (0.7% white) or
Tougaloo (0.6% white) or Florida A &amp; M (3.5% white) haven&rsquo;t
achieved enough cognitive growth, haven&rsquo;t sufficiently honed
their problem&ndash;solving skills&mdash;is that what we are supposed
to conclude? The University of Texas (enrolling 25% Hispanics and 5%
blacks) contends that without a &ldquo;critical mass&rdquo; of
minority students it can&rsquo;t reap &ldquo;the educational benefits
of diversity.&rdquo; Does this mean that Prairie View University, two
hours down the road from Austin and enrolling 7% Hispanics and 1.8%
whites, has to do without those benefits? Are its students poorly
prepared for &ldquo;our increasingly diverse workforce and
society&rdquo; (<em>Fisher</em> 2016, 2210, 2211)? Defenders of
affirmative action should think twice about claiming an education in a
&ldquo;non&ndash;diverse&rdquo; setting must be <em>degraded</em>.</p>

<p>
Fourth, there is a noticeable lack of &ldquo;fit&rdquo; between
university affirmative action practices and the diversity rationale
(see, for example, Anderson 2002, 27; Anderson 2004, 1217, 1221;
Anderson 2010, 142&ndash;143). Race is not treated just like any other
special factor that might warrant an admission &ldquo;plus.&rdquo;
Recall that &ldquo;special interest&rdquo; asserted by the Michigan
Law School. Universities work diligently to maintain a relatively
constant percentage of black and Hispanic enrollees but give variable
attention to other of the myriad qualities students can bring to
campus. As one proponent of affirmative action notes,
&ldquo;affirmative action programs&hellip;do not look or operate as if
they were testing for &lsquo;diversity&rsquo;.&rdquo; He suggests that
many supporters of affirmative action nevertheless disregard this
fact, believing &ldquo;that there is no harm in [a] miscast reliance
on diversity because, with a wink and a nod, everyone understands that
diversity is really a proxy for <em>integration</em>&rdquo;
(Issacharoff 2002, 30, 34; emphasis added; more generally see Jones
2005, Bell, 2003, Lippert-Rasmussen 2020, 124&ndash;143; Sabbagh 2007,
31&ndash;48).</p>

<h2 id="Legit">7. Legitimacy</h2>

<p>
In the midst of her recitation in <em>Grutter</em> of the educational
values of diversity, Justice O&rsquo;Connor introduced a new argument,
one that didn&rsquo;t locate the value of diversity in students&rsquo;
&ldquo;cognitive growth&rdquo; or in their future skills in
negotiating a &ldquo;diverse world,&rdquo; but in its contribution to
the health of major American institutions.</p>

<p>
Leading up to oral arguments in the case, among the <em>amici</em>
briefs the Court received was one by retired Army General Julius
Becton and twenty-eight former Defense Department officials and
retired high-ranking military officers. It explained the crucial role
racial preferences play at the service academies and ROTC programs in
maintaining an integrated officer corps (Consolidated Brief 2003,
 1&ndash;30).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>
 This brief obviously had a considerable impact on the Justices,
several of whom during oral argument pressed the lawyers representing
the parties to address its claims (<em>Grutter</em> 2003 Oral
Argument, 1&ndash;23). The brief prompted Justice O&rsquo;Connor to
include its concerns in her opinion. She noted that</p>

<blockquote>
high-ranking retired officers and civilian leaders of the United
States military assert that, &ldquo;based on [their] decades of
experience,&rdquo; a &ldquo;highly qualified, racially diverse officer
corps&hellip;is essential to the military&rsquo;s ability to fulfill
its principal mission to provide national security&hellip;.&rdquo; At
present, &ldquo;the military cannot achieve an officer corps that is
both highly qualified and racially diverse unless the service
academies and ROTC used limited race-conscious recruiting and
admissions policies&rdquo;&hellip;To fulfill its mission, the military
&ldquo;must be selective in admissions for training and education for
the officer corps, and it must train and educate a highly qualified,
racially diverse officer corps in a racially diverse setting&rdquo;
(<em>Grutter</em> 2003, 331, citations omitted).
</blockquote> And then she quickly expanded the scope of her
observation:

<blockquote>
We agree that &ldquo;it requires only a small step from this analysis
to conclude that our country&rsquo;s other most selective institutions
must remain both diverse and selective&rdquo;&hellip;The United States
as <em>amicus curiae</em>, affirms that &ldquo;ensuring that public
institutions are open and available to all segments of American
society, including people of all races and ethnicities, represents a
paramount government objective&rdquo; (<em>Grutter</em> 2003, 331,
citations omitted).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Moreover, universities, and in particular, law schools, represent the
training ground for a large number of our Nation&rsquo;s
leaders&hellip;Individuals with law degrees occupy roughly half the
state governorships, more than half the seats in the United States
Senate, and more than a third of the seats in the United States House
of Representatives&hellip;The pattern is even more striking when it
comes to selective law schools. A handful of these schools accounts
for 25 of the United States Senators, 74 United States Court of
Appeals judges, and nearly 200 of the more than 600 United States
District Court judges&hellip;<em>In order to cultivate a set of
leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry, it is necessary
that the path to leadership be visibly open to talented and qualified
individuals of every race and ethnicity. All members of our
heterogeneous society must have confidence in the openness and
integrity of the educational institutions that provide that
training</em> (<em>Grutter</em> 2003, 332; emphasis added).
</blockquote>

<p>
This new argument has little to do with the standard educational
diversity claims. West Point and Annapolis are not seeking new,
enlarged, unusual perspectives. They are in the business of molding
their students to a uniformly traditional point of view. There is no
African American or Hispanic way to fight a war; there&rsquo;s just an
&ldquo;Army way&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Navy way&rdquo; (Levinson, 584).
The armed services seek out African American and Hispanic students to
integrate the officer corps. When officers roughly mirror the racial
and ethnic profile of the enlisted ranks, military leaders seem
legitimate to those they lead; and the military as a whole seems
legitimate to the citizens it serves. The history of dysfunction that
spread throughout combat operations&mdash;especially ground
operations&mdash;during the Vietnam War testifies to the importance of
&ldquo;seeming legitimate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Consider another example, one that extends Justice
O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s remarks about the importance of law schools.
The Supreme Court is composed of four women and five men. Two of the
Justices are black, one is Hispanic. This composition is no accident.
Administrations since the 1960s&mdash;Republican and Democrat
alike&mdash;have been sensitive to the gender and racial/ethnic
make-up of the Court. President Lyndon Johnson seized the opportunity
in 1967 to appoint Thurgood Marshall. When Marshall retired, President
George H. W. Bush appointed another black Justice, Clarence Thomas. In
1981, President Ronald Reagan appointed Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor,
after pledging in his 1980 campaign to appoint the first woman to the
Court. She was followed by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, appointed in 1993 by
President Bill Clinton; by Sonia M. Sotomayor and Elena Kagan,
appointed in 2009 and 2010 by President Barack Obama; by Amy Coney
Barrett, appointed in 2020 by President Donald Trump; and by Ketanji
Brown Jackson, appointed in 2022 by President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>
These appointments were not made blindly&mdash;they were neither
color-blind nor gender-blind. They were made with an eye toward
political gain, no doubt, but also with an eye toward sustaining the
legitimacy of the Court before the American public. Moreover, the
composition of the Court reflects the fact that Harvard and Yale,
because of their affirmative action policies, had been producing a
significant number of black and Hispanic law graduates in the 1970s,
1980s, and 1990s. The current Justices possess law degrees from
Harvard (4), Yale (4), and Notre Dame. Excluding current members of
the Court, Justices appointed since 1950 came from Harvard (6), Yale
(4) Northwestern (2), Stanford (2), Columbia, and other (3).</p>

<p>
O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s legitimacy argument constituted a strong
counter-point to the standard diversity line. It directed attention
away from the &ldquo;cognitive growth&rdquo; and &ldquo;enhanced
problem-solving skills&rdquo; in students&rsquo; heads and toward the
necessity of integrating major American institutions. In a similar
vein Elizabeth Anderson has argued for integration as a value the
Court should recognize as a compelling interest:</p>

<blockquote>
Given the realities of race in the U.S., people of different race
occupy different walks of life. So in the U.S., democracy requires
racial integration of the main institutions of civil society, the
places where discussion of public import among citizens take place:
public accommodations, workplaces, schools, and neighborhoods. The
same applies to society&rsquo;s elites, those who play a pivotal role
in formulating and adopting policies of public import. Elites, <em>to
be legitimate</em>, must serve a representative function: they must be
capable of and dedicated to representing the concerns of people from
all walks of life, so that the policies they forge are responsive to
these concerns. An elite drawn only from segments of society that live
in isolation from other segments will be ignorant of the circumstances
and concerns of those who occupy other walks of life (Anderson 2004,
22; emphasis added; see also Anderson 2002; for a discussion of
Anderson&rsquo;s full integration argument, see Lippert-Rasmussen
2020, 144&ndash;158).
</blockquote>

<p>
Unfortunately Justice O&rsquo;Connor offered her legitimacy argument
as though it were a continuation of the standard diversity
justification, inserting it unexpectedly and then abandoning it just
as quickly to resume tracing the byways of diversity. Then she
undermined the argument by suggesting that race-conscious admissions
shouldn&rsquo;t be necessary after another 25 years. Such measures
must be time limited (<em>Grutter</em> 2003, 343).</p>

<h2 id="DiveLimit">8. Diversity&rsquo;s Limit</h2>

<p>
On June 29, 2023, the Supreme Court decided <em>Students for Fair
Admissions v. Harvard</em>. (It also decided a companion case,
<em>Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina.</em>
I will dwell here only on the Harvard decision. The issues in the two
cases are similar, differing only in minor details.) Students for Fair
Admissions (SFFA) contended that Harvard&rsquo;s affirmative action
policy violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (and by
extension the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution) by
discriminating against Asian American applicants. And it asked the
Court to overturn <em>Grutter</em>.</p>

<p>
The deciding opinion, written by Chief Justice Roberts, is something
of a puzzle. It ruled that Harvard&rsquo;s policy transgressed the
Constitution but it did not overrule <em>Grutter</em> and it did not
find that Harvard discriminated against Asian American applicants
(although it&rsquo;s admissions policy had a &ldquo;negative
effect&rdquo; on
 them).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The Chief Justice employed the <em>Grutter</em> framework to make his
case against Harvard. The main elements of his decision were these:
(1) Harvard&rsquo;s purported aims&mdash;training future leaders,
producing new knowledge through the clash of different perspectives,
and the like&mdash;were &ldquo;not sufficiently precise&rdquo; to be
measured by the Court (<em>SFFA</em> 2023, 22&ndash;23); (2) the
racial and ethnic categories used by Harvard were so
&ldquo;opaque&rdquo; and incoherent that Harvard couldn&rsquo;t
plausibly establish a tight connection between means (using racial
classifications) and ends (producing new leaders, new knowledge, and
so on) (<em>SFFA</em> 2023, 24&ndash;26); (3) Harvard&rsquo;s use of
race fostered stereotypes (something Justice Powell in <em>Bakke</em>
and Justice O&rsquo;Connor in <em>Grutter</em> warned against)
(<em>SFFA</em> 2023, 28&ndash;29); and Harvard&rsquo;s policy had no
end point (<em>SFFA</em> 2023, 30).</p>

<p>
The Chief Justice fully embraced Justice O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s
proposition that race-conscious affirmative action policies must have
an end point. Otherwise, he never addressed her reasoning in
<em>Grutter</em> that the University of Michigan Law School&rsquo;s
&ldquo;holistic&rdquo; search for diversity satisfied the strictures
of the Constitution. Nor did he did he address her legitimacy
argument. The closest he came was in a footnote:</p>

<blockquote>
The United States as <em>amicus curiae</em> contends that race-based
admissions programs further compelling interests at our Nation&rsquo;s
military academies. No military academy is a party to these cases,
however, and none of the courts below addressed the propriety of
race-based systems in that context. This opinion also does not address
that issue, in light of the potentially distinct interests that
military academies may present (<em>SFFA</em> 2023, 22, ftnt 4).
</blockquote>

<p>
But it was Justice O&rsquo;Connor who in 2003 broached these interests
and gave them weight. More importantly, she extended her observations
about the military academies to colleges and universities in general:
by propelling blacks and Hispanics into elite levels of leadership,
affirmative action was helping legitimate major American
institutions.</p>

<p>
The Chief Justice&rsquo;s footnote was a red flag. Within months SFFA
had brought suit against the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis
and the United States Military Academy at West
 Point.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
In the aftermath of the Court&rsquo;s decision, proponents of
affirmative action did not rise up loudly to defend &ldquo;diversity
in the head&rdquo; (students&rsquo; cognitive growth and analytical
skill development) as a still viable justification of racial and
ethnic preferences in admissions. They turned their sights to other
targets. &ldquo;Legacy&rdquo; admissions&mdash;favorable admission
decisions extended to sons and daughters of an institution&rsquo;s
alumni&mdash;immediately jumped to the top of the list. A commentator
in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> expressed a very common view:</p>

<blockquote>
Fairness requires equal opportunity for all and special privileges for
none. Yet today admission to elite colleges and universities is rife
with preferences that have nothing to do with race and give additional
advantages to the advantaged&hellip;Such policies [in particular
legacy preferences] are flatly inconsistent with the nation&rsquo;s
promise of equal opportunity, and institutions like
Harvard&mdash;whose endowment at the end of fiscal 2022 amounted to
$51 billion&mdash;can afford to change them (Galston 2023).
</blockquote>

<p>
So obviously unjust do legacies seem that after the Supreme
Court&rsquo;s <em>SFFA</em> decisions, two different bills were
introduced in Congress to ban them. States are getting into the act,
too, passing or contemplating passing legislation of their
 own.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Likewise, standardized tests used in college and professional school
admissions&mdash;especially the SAT, ACT, and LSAT&mdash;are
attracting renewed scrutiny. They long have been charged as biased
against black and Hispanic students, who score less well on them than
whites and Asian Americans. In recent years many selective colleges
and universities made the SAT or ACT optional, especially so during
the pandemic. But a shift back may be underway: MIT, Yale, Brown, and
Dartmouth recently reinstated the
 SAT.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-16" id="ref-16">16</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Indeed, the whole idea of &ldquo;merit&rdquo; is up for grabs now,
drawing on, among other sources, the debate spawned by Michael
Sandel&rsquo;s (2022) thoroughgoing critique of the meritocratic
ideal.</p>

<p>
Race-conscious affirmative action is not broadly popular (Gramlich
2023; Borter 2023). Nine states have banned it by law. California
began the trend with Proposition 209, passed by popular vote in 1996.
In 2020, fifty-seven percent of California voters defeated an effort
to roll it back. No national groundswell of protest against the
<em>SFFA</em> decisions has emerged paralleling the reaction to the
<em>Dobbs</em> 2022 decision overturning <em>Roe v. Wade</em>.</p>

<p>
As Chief Justice Roberts observed in his decision, the issue
isn&rsquo;t diversity or no diversity (read: racial and ethnic
representation), it&rsquo;s how much (<em>SFFA</em> 2023, 23). And by
what means. Three years after the <em>Grutter</em> decision in 2003,
voters in Michigan amended its constitution to forbid racial and
ethnic preferences in admissions. How has the Law School fared since?
Its class of 2026 is 9% black, 10% Hispanic, 4% Native American, 17%
Asian American, and 62% white (Morioka 2023). Is that enough? Too
little?</p>

<p>
The moral arguments for and against the use of racial and ethnic
preferences have not changed much since the 1970s. They ring
variations on a few common themes. For those readers who want to
understand these arguments in depth, the essential resource is Kasper
Lippert-Rasmussen&rsquo;s <em>Making Sense of Affirmative Action</em>
(2020). He shows that the most common arguments that proponents and
opponents deploy are much more complex than they imagined. But he
deftly guides the reader through the complexities; all he requires is
close attention.</p>

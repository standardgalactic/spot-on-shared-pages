<p>
To paraphrase Alfred North Whitehead&rsquo;s famous pronouncement
about Plato, Renaissance philosophy consisted, broadly speaking, of a
series of footnotes to Aristotle. Thanks to the
&ldquo;rediscovery&rdquo; of Aristotle&rsquo;s works in the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries, philosophers had available to them a much
larger corpus of his writings than for any other thinker of antiquity
except Galen. In the famous Aldus Greek edition of 1495&ndash;1498,
these writings (both genuine and spurious, in addition to works by
Galen, Philo, Theophrastus, and Alexander of Aphrodisias) filled five
volumes. Latin and vernacular translations had made nearly all of
these works accessible for centuries. In addition, Renaissance
thinkers could count on an extraordinarily rich commentary tradition
from the Greek, Arab, Hebrew, and medieval Latin worlds. Individual
commentators such as Averroes, Albert the Great, and Thomas Aquinas
wrote prolifically on Aristotle. Aristotle&rsquo;s methodological
procedure for arriving at the truth and the stunning breadth of his
philosophical explorations meant that &ldquo;the Philosopher&rdquo;
was literally everywhere, undergirding intellectual endeavors and
teaching not only in philosophy, but also in medicine, law, theology,
and literary theory. Up to the seventeenth century, he remained the
indispensable reference point (although hardly the definitive answer)
for any philosophical exploration.</p>

<p>
The importance of Aristotle notwithstanding, Renaissance philosophy
was not the same as Aristotelianism, if one takes this label to denote
a strain of thought representing an exclusive commitment to
Aristotelian notions and/or methods. This entry will show that it
would be exceedingly hard to find examples of such a
&ldquo;pure&rdquo; dedication to Aristotle in the period c.
1350&ndash;1650. As a result, it is better to interpret
Aristotelianism as the study of the writings then attributed (whether
rightly or wrongly) to Aristotle.</p>

<p>
As scholars in the period already began to recognize, these writings
do not form a coherent whole. Yet, despite their variable form
(lecture notes by students or original treatises), the different
audiences to which they were addressed (Aristotle&rsquo;s students or
the broader public), the presence of pseudographs such as the
<em>Problems</em>, the evolution within Aristotle&rsquo;s own
thinking, faults of transmission and translation, and the variety of
perspectives adopted by Aristotle&rsquo;s commentators, this large and
diversified corpus proved highly useful for the teaching and practice
of philosophy. This was in part because
&ldquo;Aristotle&rsquo;s&rdquo; writings cover a remarkably wide
scope: they address every branch of philosophy (logic, natural
philosophy, moral philosophy, metaphysics) as well as topics more
closely related to literary theory (rhetoric, poetics). The spurious
works also deal with many other topics, including natural theology and
medicine.</p>

<p>
This entry outlines the historical and historiographical dimensions of
Renaissance Aristotelianism before the rise of early modern
philosophy. It illustrates the variety of literary, linguistic, and
institutional contexts through which Aristotle was approached.
Additionally, it provides examples of some problems discussed in
treatments of Aristotle and the complicated relationship that
interpreters saw between Aristotelianism, other philosophical
currents, and the Christian religion. Given the vastness of a
phenomenon that stretched from Constantinople through Western Europe
and from there to its worldwide colonies, the topics and interpreters
mentioned are meant to be illustrative rather than comprehensive.
There is currently no exhaustive account of the features and
development of Renaissance Aristotelianism, although Schmitt 1983a and
Martin 2014 are excellent starting points.</p>

<h2 id="Hist">1. Historiography</h2>

<p>
Traditional (and now largely outdated) accounts of Renaissance
philosophy used to depict Aristotelianism as a unified, static, and
sterile current of thought that was based in the universities and was
beaten into retreat by the rise of Platonism, academies, and a more
human-centered philosophical approach (sometimes confusingly
identified with &ldquo;humanism&rdquo;). This perspective, often
derived from implicit anti-religious and anti-scholastic biases, began
to lose credibility in the 1950s and 1960s (and then, more rapidly, in
the 1970s and 1980s) thanks to the studies by Paul Oskar Kristeller,
Bruno Nardi, Antonino Poppi, F. Edward Cranz, Charles B. Schmitt,
Charles H. Lohr, and other scholars. Building on the magnificent
achievements of historians of science such as Pierre Duhem and Lynn
Thorndike, these scholars&rsquo; explorations of the commentary
tradition highlighted the longevity and diversity of Aristotle&rsquo;s
influence. Lohr&rsquo;s repertories of Aristotle commentators showed
that, far from disappearing, Aristotelian works were the subject of
renewed interest in the Renaissance, such that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the number of Latin commentaries on Aristotle composed within this
brief period [1500&ndash;1650] exceeds that of the entire millennium
from Boethius to Pomponazzi. (Lohr 1974: 228)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Cranz and Schmitt (1984) documented, through a repertory of printed
editions, how influential Aristotle continued to be (see
 <a href="#SourRefeWorkDesi">&sect;5</a>).
 Schmitt also strongly underscored the variety of Aristotelian
interpretations and approaches, suggesting that we should speak about
&ldquo;Renaissance Aristotelianisms&rdquo; in the plural rather than
as a single movement (Schmitt 1983a: 10&ndash;33). No serious scholar
now ignores the importance of Renaissance Aristotelianism(s), even
while emphasizing other currents such as Platonism or Stoicism.
(Epicureanism, by contrast, gained few followers in the period.) The
Aristotelian tradition is now being examined from numerous
perspectives, including the history of education, literature, art,
translation, and religion.</p>

<h2 id="HistDeve">2. Historical Development(s)</h2>

<p>
Aristotle&rsquo;s thought had a somewhat delayed influence on the
ancient world and enjoyed its flowering only much later. Roman
thinkers such as Cicero, as well as the early Church Fathers, knew
(of) him, but it was Plato who clearly had the upper hand, even as
late as St Augustine of Hippo (354&ndash;430)&mdash;despite the work
of Greek commentators such as Aspasius (second century A.D.),
Alexander of Aphrodisias (late second to early third century),
Plotinus (204/5&ndash;270), Porphyry (234?&ndash;305?), Iamblichus
(242?&ndash;325), and Themistius (fl. c. 350) in intervening years.
(Another important commentator was Johannes Philoponus
[490&ndash;570], who however came a bit later.) Late antiquity saw
Boethius&rsquo; (c. 475&ndash;526) influential translation of
Aristotle&rsquo;s logic into Latin, but Aristotle&rsquo;s more
substantial <em>fortuna</em> in the Latin West had to wait until the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries, with the rise of the universities.
This may have been due to the need to find a suitable foundation for
the study of philosophy. In any case, the efforts to translate and
comment on Aristotle&rsquo;s works extended to earlier commentaries
produced in the Byzantine and Arab worlds: thus, interpreters such as
Eustratius of Nicaea (c. 1050&ndash;c. 1120) and Averroes (Ibn Rushd,
1126&ndash;1198) soon became highly influential in Latin translation.
By around 1270 nearly all of Aristotle&rsquo;s works&mdash;and several
spurious ones besides&mdash;had become available for study. (The
notable exception was the <em>Poetics</em>, which&mdash;despite a
commentary by Averroes&mdash;only became better known in the late
fifteenth century.) These works were usually taught in philosophy
courses, where they were grouped under the headings of logic, natural
and moral philosophy, and metaphysics. Starting in the fifteenth
century, professors of humanities or rhetoric might teach, in addition
to Latin writers such as Cicero and Virgil, Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Rhetoric</em> and <em>Poetics</em>, as well as the spurious
<em>Rhetoric to Alexander</em>.</p>

<p>
Early Italian humanists&mdash;defined here as literary
scholars&mdash;had an ambivalent attitude toward Aristotle and
Aristotelianism. In his famous work <em>On His Own Ignorance and That
of Many Others</em> (<em>De sui ipsius et multorum ignorantia</em>),
Petrarch (Francesco Petrarca, 1304&ndash;1374) attacked some
contemporary scholars for following Aristotle &ldquo;blindly&rdquo;,
but also objected to Aristotle&rsquo;s discussion of useless and
possibly false matters such as the crocodile&rsquo;s ability to move
its upper jaw or the number of hairs on a lion&rsquo;s head. He also
criticized Aristotle&rsquo;s treatment of virtue in the
<em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>, claiming that &ldquo;his lesson lacks the
words that sting and set afire and urge toward love of virtue and
hatred of vice&rdquo; (Petrarch [CKR: 103]). Although professional
rivalry may have played a role, this attitude seems to have stemmed
especially from a clash of subjects and methodologies: Petrarch and
his literarily inclined colleagues prized eloquence and saw it as key
to the production of virtue. Some of them (including Petrarch) were
especially taken by Plato, although few at the time (Petrarch was no
exception) could read him in the original. This is not, however, to
say that they turned their backs on Aristotle: the humanist chancellor
of Florence, Leonardo Bruni (1370&ndash;1444), not only wrote a
<em>Life of Aristotle</em> (<em>Vita Aristotelis</em>), but he
retranslated his moral philosophy (ethics, politics, and economics)
into Ciceronian Latin, claiming that his works in Greek were
&ldquo;filled with elegance, delight, and a certain fathomless
beauty&rdquo; (Bruni, <em>The Correct Way to Translate</em> [1987:
217]). Other scholars studied (and sometimes retranslated) his logic
and works of natural philosophy. By the 1490s, Florence&rsquo;s most
famous humanist, the young Angelo Poliziano (1454&ndash;1494), was
teaching the whole range of Aristotle&rsquo;s works at the University
of Florence. His justification was that, as a <em>grammaticus</em> (a
philologist), he was competent in all fields of study. In the second
half of the fifteenth century, Bologna boasted at least two humanists
who taught, in addition to more literary and rhetorical works,
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Physics</em> (the Hellenist Andronicus
Callistus, dates uncertain) and his <em>De interpretatione</em>
(Antonio Urceo Cortesi, or Codro, 1446&ndash;1500) (Lines 2023:
186&ndash;191). The renowned Venetian printer Aldus Manutius issued a
Greek edition of Aristotle&rsquo;s complete works in five volumes
(1495&ndash;1498). Likewise, Desiderius Erasmus (&dagger;1536) of
Rotterdam had an interest in Aristotle and superintended a new Greek
edition of his works (1516), although most of the donkey work was done
by Simon Grynaeus (Kraye 1990 and 1995).</p>

<p>
In Central and Northern Europe, Aristotle&rsquo;s works had exercised
a decisive influence on philosophy at least since the
thirteenth-century contributions of Robert Grosseteste
(&dagger;1253)&mdash;a key translator of Aristotle&rsquo;s works and
of various Greek commentaries&mdash;as well as Albert the Great (c.
1200&ndash;1280) and Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225&ndash;1274), both of whom
commented on a wide range of his writings. The influence of Italian
humanism and of Martin Luther&rsquo;s Reformation redirected (but did
not diminish) this earlier interest in Aristotle. The Wittenberg
professor Philipp Melanchthon (1497&ndash;1560) tempered
Luther&rsquo;s deep suspicions about the Stagirite&rsquo;s views, and
the Protestant universities continued, as elsewhere, to have
Aristotelian philosophy at the core of their arts curriculum.
Universities such as Paris, Oxford, and Salamanca remained significant
centers for the interpretation of Aristotle. Likewise, the colleges of
the Society of Jesus (established in 1540) and of orders such as the
Dominicans relied on the Aristotelian corpus for their own
philosophical curriculum in their programs worldwide. Despite the rise
of anti-Aristotelianism (see
 <a href="">&sect;4.</a>3.4),
 students and scholars across Europe (and beyond, especially in the
English, Spanish, and Portuguese colonies) continued to engage with
Aristotle&rsquo;s thought.</p>

<p>
The same was true of universities, whose teaching of
&ldquo;Aristotle&rdquo; endured long after the &ldquo;new
philosophy&rdquo; of Francis Bacon (1561&ndash;1626) and Ren&eacute;
Descartes (1596&ndash;1650) had made its mark. This does not mean,
however, that either masters or students were necessarily in agreement
with Aristotelian doctrines. Indeed, records of philosophical lectures
indicate that professors presented students with the ideas of
Aristotle and expected them to know them (teaching perforce involves
transmitting established views), but then also incorporated in their
courses insights from recent or contemporary figures (Brockliss 1987;
Lines 2023). Likewise, the schools of the religious orders were less
conservative than one might expect.</p>

<h2 id="ContLangGenr">3. Contexts, Languages, and Genres</h2>

<p>
The universities and schools of the religious orders, however, were by
no means the only contexts in which discussions of Aristotle took
place. Several learned circles and more formal academies (including
the Accademia degli Infiammati in Padua and the Accademia Fiorentina)
explored Aristotle&rsquo;s challenging philosophical works. Princely
courts might stage readings and discussions of his writings. (A famous
case is the court of the king of France, Henri III; see Yates 1947
and, more broadly, Lines 2013). Popular works such as Leon Battista
Alberti&rsquo;s <em>Books on the Family</em> (<em>I libri della
famiglia</em>) were based on (possibly fictitious) conversations among
friends about Aristotelian moral philosophy&mdash;specifically the
<em>Oeconomics</em>, a work about household management then attributed
to Aristotle&mdash;and Xenophon&rsquo;s <em>Oeconomicus</em> (Cabrini
2007). Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays at times deal with aspects of
Aristotelian thought (e.g., ethics, poetics) that contemporaries would
have recognized.</p>

<p>
This broad range of contexts was facilitated by a remarkably intense
effort to make Aristotle&rsquo;s ideas and writings accessible in the
vernacular. Previous centuries had already seen translations or
adaptations of Aristotle&rsquo;s works in languages such as French and
Italian (see, for instance, Brunetto Latini&rsquo;s <em>Les livres du
tr&eacute;sor</em>, subsequently translated into Italian). In the
Renaissance, this phenomenon blossomed: in addition to multiple new
Latin translations (penned by figures such as the Greek
&eacute;migr&eacute;s Johannes Argyropoulos and Theodore Gaza),
translations into French, Italian, Spanish, English, German, and other
languages greatly expanded the potential readership of these works
(for the Italian case, see Lines &amp; Refini 2014 and Bianchi,
Gilson, &amp; Kraye 2016; more broadly, Lines &amp; Puliafito 2019).
But one should be wary of interpreting this phenomenon in terms of a
process of &ldquo;democratization of knowledge&rdquo; (Sgarbi 2022):
at the end of the day, only people who could read, had already
received some training in philosophy, were highly interested and
motivated, and had some leisure and economic means were likely to
approach Aristotle&rsquo;s works. Still, it is remarkable that people
trained in manual crafts like Benedetto Varchi (1503&ndash;1565) and
women like Camilla Erculiani (d. after 1584) not only did so, but also
went on to write on Aristotle (Andreoni 2012; Erculiani
<em>Letters</em> [2021]).</p>

<p>
This expansion in languages and publics also found a parallel in a
growing number of genres that treated Aristotle&rsquo;s writings.
Again, the phenomenon was not unknown in previous centuries, where
literal commentaries, question commentaries, and compendia (but also
visual representations) provided multiple avenues of access to the
Philosopher. But the Renaissance saw an explosion of additional forms:
letters, dialogues, orations, paraphrases, treatises, essays, student
disputations, printed editions (also in Greek), and even literary
works such as the tales of Marguerite de Navarre (Langer 1994) were
all added to the previous mix, as part of a widespread effort to
reinterpret and, quite often, save Aristotelian ideas from the attacks
they were coming under. New discoveries or theories about the
universe, physics, and the human body; geographical explorations;
theological controversies (such as the meritoriousness of unaided
virtue or the nature of the Eucharist); philological advances,
including the recovery of several works from antiquity; the rise of
the new philosophy&mdash;all of these in various ways questioned
significant aspects of the received Aristotelian framework, producing
an almost frenzied activity aimed at re-evaluating the Philosopher and
seeing how much of his system could be retained in the light of new
trends and criticisms (Bianchi 2003; see below,
 <a href="">&sect;4.3.4</a>).</p>
 
<h2 id="SeleFielTopiComp">4. Selected Fields, Topics, and Competitors</h2>

<h3 id="Fiel">4.1 Fields</h3>

<p>
It is worthwhile outlining the most important fields and works of the
Renaissance Aristotle, before discussing some important topics of
debate.</p>

<p>
Logic was the cornerstone of medieval and Renaissance Aristotelianism,
both in providing principles that were foundational and in common with
other disciplines (such as law, theology, medicine) and in being
considered a preliminary and basic subject. Of all the branches of
Aristotelian thought, logic had the longest pedigree in Latin, since
the <em>Categories</em> and <em>On Interpretation</em> (along with
Porphyry&rsquo;s <em>Isagoge</em>) had been translated by Boethius in
the early sixth century (<em>logica vetus</em>); works that became
known in the twelfth century&mdash;<em>Topics, Sophistical
Refutations, Prior and Posterior Analytics</em>&mdash;were known as
the <em>logica nova</em> (Ashworth 1988). Together, the old and new
logic provided the essentials of a field that nearly everyone studied
at school and/or university or in the schools/colleges of the
religious orders. Or, at least, that was the idea. In practice, logic
was often approached through handbooks, such as the wildly popular
<em>Summaries of Logic</em> (<em>Summulae logicales</em>, c. 1240) by
Peter of Spain (the work continued to be widely used in the sixteenth
century) and Paul of Venice&rsquo;s <em>Small Logic</em> (<em>Logica
parva</em>, c. 1396&ndash;1399). Furthermore, under the influence of
the Dutch humanist Rudolph Agricola (1443/4&ndash;1485), the
Renaissance saw a change in the teaching of logic, which often moved
into a closer relationship with rhetoric (Mack 1993; Lagerlund 2017;
Knuuttila 2017).</p>

<p>
After logic, students across Europe tackled the higher aspects of
Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophy. In Italy, the <em>Physics</em>, <em>On
the Heavens</em>, and <em>On the Soul</em> would typically start off
each year of study of natural philosophy, with gaps being filled in by
many of the &ldquo;minor&rdquo; works such as <em>On Generation and
Corruption</em>, the <em>Meteorology</em>, and the works on animals,
or even pseudographs such as <em>The Secret of Secrets</em> or
<em>Problems</em>. Also of interest was Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Metaphysics</em>, studied either on its own (especially in
Northern Europe) or as a complement to problems in natural philosophy
(often the case in Italian universities). Moral philosophy (usually on
the basis of Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>, and
sometimes extending&mdash;especially in Central and Northern
Europe&mdash;also to the <em>Oeconomics</em> and the
<em>Politics</em>) might be taught in parallel with natural philosophy
or immediately after it. This was a field that initially struggled to
be recognized as an official and required subject in the Italian
universities and was taught more regularly elsewhere, particularly in
universities founded on the Parisian model, including the Jesuit
Collegio Romano (Lines 2002).</p>

<p>
The study of works such as the <em>Rhetoric</em>, the <em>Rhetoric to
Alexander</em>, and the <em>Poetics</em> almost always took place in
courses or discussions of rhetoric and humanities rather than
philosophy. It was a study that developed especially in
sixteenth-century Italy and had to find creative ways to complement
the long-established role of Cicero (and the <em>Rhetorica ad
Herennium</em> attributed to him) as a foundation for the teaching of
rhetoric in schools and universities (Mack 2011: 24&ndash;26,
169&ndash;71).</p>

<p>
All of these areas were approached both through the relevant works of
Aristotle (initially only in medieval translations; from the fifteenth
century also through fresh translations and occasionally through the
original Greek) and through a rich commentary tradition, in which
Averroes (and later, to some extent, the Greek commentators) played a
considerable role, together with giants of the thirteenth-century
Latin tradition such as Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas and later
influential interpreters such as Walter Burley (c. 1275&ndash;1344/5)
and John Buridan (c. 1300&ndash;post 1358). Classroom teaching could
vary significantly depending on the specific branch of philosophy, the
geographical area, the chronological moment, and the preferences of
master and/or students, but usually consisted of a combined
explanation of (and the solution of questions on) Aristotle&rsquo;s
text and his commentators. The presence within the Greek and Arabic
commentary traditions of Platonic, Neoplatonic, and fundamentally
non-Christian ideas (e.g., in the works of Averroes) meant that
students of Aristotle in the Latin West faced the conundrum of
reconciling these multiple points of view both with each other and
with Christian assumptions
 (<a href="#RecoArisChri">&sect;i;4.2</a>).
 Furthermore, as anticipated above, new discoveries or theories (such
as Copernicanism or the rise of the &ldquo;new science&rdquo;) led to
questioning important aspects of the commonly accepted worldview,
including the cosmological model that rested on the viewpoints of
Aristotle and Ptolemy
 (<a href="#Cosm">&sect;4.2.1</a>).</p>
 
<p>
The availability of important new works such as the <em>Poetics</em>
gave rise to significant debates and cultural changes, including on
the theory of playwriting. In other cases, figures critiqued and tried
to replace wholesale Aristotle&rsquo;s influence in specific fields.
Mario Nizolio argued, in his <em>On the True Principles and True
Method of Philosophizing against the Pseudo-Philosophers</em> (<em>De
veris principiis et vera ratione philosophandi contra
pseudophilosophos</em>, 1553), against Aristotelian dialectic and
metaphysics. Petrus Ramus (&dagger;1572), a professor in Paris, spent
much of his career trying to find ways to replace Aristotle&rsquo;s
rhetoric and logic (Gilbert 1960; Couzinet 2015).</p>

<h3 id="RecoArisChri">4.2 Reconciling Aristotelianism with Christianity</h3>

<p>
Ever since Thomas Aquinas&rsquo; synthesis of Christianity,
Aristotelianism, and elements of Platonism, Western thinkers had
thought of Christian and Aristotelian doctrines as largely (although
not necessarily wholly) compatible. At the same time, they were quite
aware that Aristotle was not an infallible authority. They knew that
there were areas, such as psychology (see below,
 <a href="#Soul">&sect;4.2.2</a>),
 in which Aristotle&rsquo;s teachings were at least potentially
problematic. Such fissures became increasingly evident as readers of
Aristotle in the Latin West became more familiar with other
interpretive traditions and with the writings of philosophers such as
Plato (who in the Middle Ages had a significant indirect influence but
was known directly through only a handful of dialogues). Platonism had
a particular resonance with Christianity because of Plato&rsquo;s
teachings about the immortality of the soul and his acceptance by
Church Fathers such as Augustine. With the fifteenth-century influx of
many Greek scholars to Italy (Plato was more highly prized than
Aristotle in the Byzantine schools) and the subsequent Latin
translation of Plato&rsquo;s complete works by the Florentine
philosopher Marsilio Ficino (1433&ndash;1499), some began to see
Aristotle as less useful than his teacher for the development of a
Christian philosophy. A significant uptick in the activity of
scientific publishing and Aristotelian commentary also highlighted
various areas in which Christian and Aristotelian viewpoints seemed
more divergent than they had previously appeared. Such an awareness
led to moves to contain and correct Aristotle&rsquo;s impious or
potentially dangerous teachings. These included the famous 1513 papal
bull <em>Apostolici regiminis</em> (issued during the Fifth Lateran
Council), which clarified Christian dogma on the soul and instructed
professors of philosophy to rebut arguments that were contrary to
Christian doctrine.</p>

<h4 id="Cosm">4.2.1 Cosmology</h4>

<p>
The traditional geocentric picture of the universe (elaborated by
Ptolemy, second century A.D., but largely indebted to Aristotle) saw
an immobile earth at the center, above which were the perfect and
unchangeable heavenly spheres, governed by an unmoved Mover. This
viewpoint had been fully accepted by Christian thinkers and
popularized through writings such as Dante Alighieri&rsquo;s
<em>Divina commedia</em> (<em>Divine Comedy</em>). Although there was
no specific scriptural endorsement of it, there seemed to be no reason
<em>not</em> to accept it, and it made sense of language in the Bible
such as the sun &ldquo;standing still&rdquo; when Joshua needed more
time to defeat his enemies (Joshua 10:12&ndash;14). A significant
challenge to this system was the 1543 work <em>De revolutionibus
orbium caelestium</em> (<em>The Revolutions of the Heavenly
Spheres</em>) by the Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus
(1473&ndash;1543), who argued instead for a heliocentric model on the
basis of multiple observations and mathematical calculations, as well
as this model&rsquo;s congruity with certain religious and
philosophical assumptions. Famously, Copernicus&rsquo; theory was
taken up and defended by scientists and mathematicians such as
Johannes Kepler, Tycho Brahe, and Galileo Galilei, whose observations
seemed to prove the existence of comets as new celestial phenomena
(thus questioning Aristotle&rsquo;s cosmology, according to which the
heavens were unchanging) and the rotation of the earth around the sun
and its own axis. The Catholic Church saw Copernicanism as contrary to
church teaching (1616) and prohibited Galileo and others from publicly
supporting it (1633). Nonetheless, the Church was not able to contain
the growing consensus around heliocentrism, particularly in Protestant
lands. Nor was it able quickly enough to silence the speculations
about the infinity and multiplicity of the universe put forward by
eccentric but vocal figures like Giordano Bruno (burned at the stake
in Rome in 1600).</p>

<p>
In some other areas closely related to cosmology such as the issue of
the age of the world, opinion was set against Aristotle from an early
date. Aristotle had argued in <em>Physics</em>, VIII.1&ndash;10 that
the world must be eternal, i.e., without a beginning. But this notion
contrasted so evidently with the biblical account of creation (and
with the interpretation of eminent Church Fathers such as Augustine)
that it found few takers among orthodox Christians. The Fourth Lateran
Council (1215) elevated Augustine&rsquo;s doctrine of creation <em>ex
nihilo</em> to dogma. Yet Aristotle&rsquo;s (and Averroes&rsquo;)
espousal of eternalism did find some support. Biagio Pelacani da Parma
(&dagger;1416), a professor at the universities of Pavia, Bologna, and
Padua, was forced to recant his espousal of this position at the
bishop&rsquo;s court of Pavia in 1396. Nicoletto Vernia
(1420&ndash;1499), a Paduan professor, likewise assumed the eternity
of the world (Martin 2022). For other fifteenth-century thinkers, such
as Marsilio Ficino, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, and the Greek
&eacute;migr&eacute;s Gemistus Pletho, George of Trebizond, and
Cardinal Bessarion, the eternity of the world was an important
concern, not least because late ancient Platonists accepted this
notion. Since Plato, instead, had given an account of creation in his
<em>Timaeus</em>, there was an evident discordance among ancient
authorities. For the sixteenth century, the problem of the eternity of
the world has not been well studied (Connell 2011, Dal Prete 2022).
Nonetheless, we know that Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli was one of those
strongly arguing for the eternity of the world (see his
<em>Discorsi</em> II, 5; Sasso 1987), as was Giordano Bruno (e.g., in
<em>De l&rsquo;infinito, universo e mondi</em>). Jesuits such as
Jacobus Ledesma took issue with this doctrine (Martin 2014:
88&ndash;90), as did several Franciscans and Dominicans (both in and
outside of Italy), taking aim also at what was, in their view, a more
general inclination toward Averroism among sixteenth-century Italians.
Similar criticisms were voiced in the Protestant camp. The Lutheran
professor Nicolaus Taurellus (1547&ndash;1606) proposed a metaphysical
approach to the problem of the eternity of the world; the Calvinist
Otto Casmann (1562&ndash;1607) also insisted that it could not be a
problem that had two different solutions (a philosophical and a
theological one). An outlier was Julius Caesar Scaliger
(1484&ndash;1558), who was convinced of the congruence between
Aristotle and Christianity and argued that Aristotle believed in
God&rsquo;s creation of the world (Martin 2014: 83, 96&ndash;99).</p>

<p>
Another important problem arose from Aristotle&rsquo;s view that there
is no heavenly interference in the sublunary world. This notion had
consequences for how the role of divine providence was interpreted;
so, thinkers as varied as Melanchthon, Ramus, Francesco Patrizi da
Cherso (1529&ndash;1597), and the sixteenth-century Englishman Richard
Bostocke explored the topic in some detail&mdash;usually concluding
that Aristotle&rsquo;s teaching in this area was not in accordance
with Christian faith (Martin 2014, <em>ad indicem</em>).</p>

<p>
Renaissance Aristotelianism was therefore constantly engaging with the
ancient and medieval commentary tradition, and with Averroes in
particular.</p>

<h4 id="Soul">4.2.2 The Soul</h4>

<p>
The overlaps between Aristotelianism and Averroism are again relevant
in questions about the soul. Two long-standing problems in medieval
and Renaissance discussions concerned the individuality and
immortality of a human&rsquo;s rational intellect. Does each human
have an individual soul, in which case how do we explain our common
thinking patterns and perceptions? And to what extent is an
individual&rsquo;s soul tied to the body? On these matters, Christian
doctrine is quite clear: the soul is individual, and there is an
individual afterlife in store for every human being. (At death, the
body releases its soul; at the resurrection, the soul and body are
again joined together.) These teachings have much in common with
Plato&rsquo;s views (although the Christian position accorded the body
a more positive valence), but not with those of Aristotle and
Averroes. Aristotle&rsquo;s doctrine of hylomorphism (the union of
form and matter) points to a close relationship between the
intellective soul and the functions of sensation, which require a
body. Indeed, he claims:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It&rsquo;s clear that the soul is not separable from the body&mdash;or
that certain parts of it, if it has parts, are not separable from the
body. (<em>De anima</em> II.1, 413a3&ndash;5)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It seems therefore that the soul (including, presumably, its highest
part, the rational intellect) cannot survive the death of the body.
Since forms in Aristotle are not universal as in Plato, the soul is
individual but not immortal. (It is worth noting, however, that
Aristotle&rsquo;s position was by means clear, so that it could be
interpreted in several divergent ways; the materialist interpretation
was strongly held by his ancient commentator Alexander of
Aphrodisias.) Averroes&rsquo; mature comments on Aristotle point to an
agent intellect and a material intellect, each of which is a single,
separate, and eternal substance. This position emphasizes the
soul&rsquo;s immortality, but denies its individuality, since the
intellective soul is not unique to each individual and, upon death,
returns to the larger universal intellect of which it is a part. It
thus makes nonsense of the Christian belief in individual
immortality.</p>

<p>
Historians of philosophy have classed the supporters of these two
positions as Alexandrists and Averroists respectively and have noted
the occasional voicing of these interpretations already in the Middle
Ages: examples are the works of Siger of Brabant (c. 1240&ndash;1284)
and various ecclesiastical condemnations (such as those of 1270 and
1277 in Paris; Bianchi 1997). Yet it is in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries that these positions came to the fore most strongly, as
indicated by the activity of professors at Padua and Bologna. Teachers
such as Biagio Pelacani da Parma and Nicoletto Vernia in Padua
 (<a href="#Cosm">&sect;4.2.1</a>)
 and Alessandro Achillini (1463&ndash;1512) in Bologna promoted
Averroes&rsquo; interpretations of the soul. But they had to contend
with rebuttals, not only from supporters of the orthodox Christian
position, but from followers of Alexander of Aphrodisias (Martin 2014:
ch. 3).</p>

<p>
The most famous Alexandrist was Pietro Pomponazzi (1462&ndash;1525), a
professor at Padua and Bologna. Pomponazzi&rsquo;s treatise <em>On the
Immortality of the Soul</em> (<em>De immortalitate animae</em>, 1516)
caused an uproar. It stated that, from a philosophical perspective,
there were no conclusive arguments for the soul&rsquo;s immortality.
This position was not altogether new, since&mdash;as Pomponazzi
himself noted&mdash;John Duns Scotus (c. 1265&ndash;1308) had
expressed a similar view. Coming on the heels of the <em>Apostolici
regiminis</em> bull of 1513, however, Pomponazzi&rsquo;s treatise
should have offered a convincing refutation of positions contrary to
Christianity. Instead, it only offered a brief, half-hearted
conclusion supporting the Christian position simply as a matter of
faith. Furthermore, the treatise seemed to imply that a Christian view
of the soul, informed by Thomas Aquinas&rsquo; emphasis on its
immortality and separability, was not necessary for a virtuous life,
but had been introduced so as to preserve order in society. These and
other aspects of the work led to intense debate and widespread
criticism; Pomponazzi himself came under pressure to retract some of
his statements, but the protection of powerful patrons allowed him to
continue his teaching largely undisturbed until his death in 1525.
Unlike his <em>On Fate</em> (<em>De fato</em>) and <em>On
Incantations</em> (<em>De incantationibus</em>), published some
decades after his death, <em>On the Immortality of the Soul</em> was
never placed on the Index of Prohibited Books. It is notable, however,
that the work&rsquo;s only official sixteenth-century reprint came in
1525; there it was accompanied by other works and by the critical
arguments of the Dominican friar Giovanni Crisostomo Javelli
(Pomponazzi 1525; Spruit 2017). (An edition of Pomponazzi&rsquo;s
treatise also appeared in 1534, but without indication of printer and
without Javelli&rsquo;s response.)</p>

<p>
Debates about the soul did not cease with Pomponazzi. The topic
continued to be a bone of contention both for followers of Pomponazzi
such as the Neapolitan Simone Porzio (1496&ndash;1544; Del Soldato
2010) and the Paduan professor Giacomo Zabarella (1533&ndash;1589) and
also for several thinkers who sided against him. As we will see, some
of these scholars were strongly influenced in their arguments by the
doctrines of ancient philosophers such as Plato
 (<a href="#ArisOthePhilCurr">&sect;4.3</a>).</p>
 
<h4 id="MoraPhil">4.2.3 Moral philosophy</h4>

<p>
The challenge of bringing Aristotle in line with Christian assumptions
extended also to the sphere of moral philosophy (Kraye 1988, 1998).
This was typically understood to consist of ethics, economics or
household management, and politics, branches that were approached
through the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>, the <em>Oeconomics</em>, and
the <em>Politics</em> respectively. (The authenticity of the
<em>Oeconomics</em> is doubtful; other works of ethics by
&ldquo;Aristotle&rdquo; include the <em>Eudemian Ethics</em> and the
<em>Magna Moralia</em>, but the latter is again probably spurious.)
From a Christian perspective, there were several problems with
Aristotle&rsquo;s ethical theory. Chief among them was his view of
happiness or flourishing (<em>eudaimonia</em>), which both assumes
that habituation can produce moral virtue without the intervention of
divine grace and operates entirely in an earthly perspective, without
consideration of the afterlife or of God. The latter viewpoint is
evident from the very opening of the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>,
which claims that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and choice, is
thought to aim at some good; and for this reason, the good
(<em>tagathon</em>) has rightly been declared to be that at which all
things aim&hellip;. If then, there is some end of the things we do,
which we desire for its own sake &hellip; , clearly this must be the
good and chief good. (I.1&ndash;2, 1094a)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Aristotle goes on, in the first book of the <em>Ethics</em>, to
explore the best definition of this human good or <em>eudaimonia</em>,
which &ldquo;turns out to be the activity of the soul in conformity
with [the best and most complete] excellence&rdquo;, accompanied by
pleasure and external goods, and during the course of a complete
lifetime (I.7, 1098a16&ndash;18).</p>

<p>
For Christians, identifying the ultimate good with an earthly activity
or state amounts to idolatry, since only God can be our ultimate and
highest good. Thus, thirteenth-century thinkers such as Thomas Aquinas
already took issue with Aristotle on this point, claiming that, on the
contrary, &ldquo;the last beatitude or happiness of any intelligent
substance is to know God&rdquo; (<em>Summa contra Gentiles</em>, III,
25). (Other Christian interpreters who laid a stronger stress on the
will emphasized instead the goal of <em>loving</em> God.) This did
not, however, mean that Aristotle&rsquo;s considerations on ethics
were worthless&mdash;indeed, Thomas wrote a detailed literal
commentary on the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>. It did, however, mean
that Christian interpreters noted Aristotle&rsquo;s concern with only
one aspect of the human experience. Nonetheless, unease about
Aristotle&rsquo;s position continued and led Leonardo Bruni to offer
an alternate rendering of <em>tagathon</em> in his translation of the
work (1416/1417): instead of <em>bonum</em> (or &ldquo;the
good&rdquo;, as the medieval translation had it), this became
<em>summum bonum</em> (&ldquo;the highest good&rdquo;), in an evident
reference not to a human good but to God. (This rendering came in for
some severe criticism and was rectified by other translations, such as
that of Johannes Argyropoulos [c. 1415&ndash;1487], which instead
translates <em>tagathon</em> as &ldquo;bonum quoddam&rdquo; or
&ldquo;a certain good&rdquo;.) Other interpreters tied the theme of
happiness more closely to Christian concerns by highlighting its
religious and otherworldly dimensions. Such an operation sometimes
involved a Christianization of other pagan currents. A good example is
Lorenzo Valla&rsquo;s (1407&ndash;1457) dialogue <em>On Pleasure</em>
(in its final version, <em>De vero falsoque bono</em>), which
identifies Epicurean happiness with the enjoyment of God, both in this
life and in the hereafter. He was followed by Bartolomeo Facio (before
1410&ndash;1457), whose <em>On the Happiness of Life</em> (<em>De
vitae felicitate</em>) and <em>On Human Excellence</em> (<em>De
hominis excellentia</em>) emphasized the bliss of contemplating of God
(Trinkaus 1970: I, 200&ndash;29), while Marsilio Ficino highlighted
the other-worldly dimension of felicity in his letter &ldquo;On
Happiness&rdquo;. These writers drew on philosophical traditions
outside of Aristotelianism in order to reinterpret and correct
Aristotle&rsquo;s concept of <em>eudaimonia</em> (Lines 2019a).</p>

<p>
Another cause for concern was both the framing and the content of
Aristotle&rsquo;s account of the moral virtues. As a pagan, he gives
no space to the workings of divine grace, assuming that education and
habituation will, given enough motivation, produce the desired
qualities and help people achieve the golden mean, say between avarice
and prodigality or fear and reckless courage (<em>Nicomachean
Ethics</em>, Book II). This created a difficulty especially for
Protestant interpreters, who placed more emphasis than Catholic ones
on the utter inability of unaided human effort to achieve the good.
Love (the greatest of the Christian virtues) is missing in Aristotle,
as is faith. Nor is there any place for other important virtues such
as humility. A description of the fruit of the Holy Spirit given by
the Apostle Paul is telling for its contrast with the pagan virtues:
&ldquo;The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control&rdquo;
(Galatians 5:22&ndash;23 ESV). Christian commentators might therefore
concede the usefulness of the discussion of the virtues that Aristotle
does consider in Books III&ndash;V (the last one, justice, is
especially important in a political setting), while maintaining that
Aristotle&rsquo;s partial account needs to be supplemented by the
Christian message. This was the case for Melanchthon. He and others
found it problematic that the constellation of Aristotelian virtues
does not altogether map onto Christian ones. Nonetheless, the larger
problem was that Aristotle&rsquo;s discussion was clearly incomplete
and lacked the power of the gospel message to produce virtue in human
beings. In this area, only the work of the Holy Spirit is sufficient.
Despite all of this, Melanchthon holds that the civic dimension of
Aristotle&rsquo;s virtues is important and deserves to be studied
(Melanchthon 1532: sigs. Aii<sup>r</sup>&ndash;Bi<sup>v</sup>).</p>

<p>
The link Aristotle established between ethics and politics was also
important from the perspective of the Christian Commonwealth. In
Aristotle&rsquo;s understanding of ethics, virtuous lawgivers were
essential to help the young habituate themselves to the exercise of
virtue. They would, in turn, be expected to continue to be virtuous
upon taking office and promote virtue in others. Furthermore,
Aristotle saw a continuity between the principles enunciated in the
<em>Ethics</em> and those discussed in the <em>Politics</em>: it was
simply a matter of broadening the scope from the individual to the
community. All of this sat well with medieval assumptions (reliant in
part on the Old Testament: see Proverbs and Sirach, also known as
Ecclesiasticus) that saw rulers as paragons of both human virtue
(justice, mercy, etc.) and godliness. <em>On the Rule of Princes</em>
(<em>De regimine principum</em>) of Giles of Rome (&dagger;1316) is
just one of numerous mirrors-for-princes reminding monarchs of the
standards of behavior required. Writings by Italian humanists did not
so much challenge this tie between virtue and princely office as
extend the principle to republican constitutions, arguing for instance
that the <em>popolo</em> itself needed to be virtuous in order to
govern successfully and flourish. (This was an echo of biblical
considerations: see Deuteronomy 5:1&ndash;11.) Yet some of these
humanist writers saw matters, not so much in the perspective of Greek
thought, where moral virtues enabled political self-mastery and the
preservation of constitutions, but in the Roman one, which regarded
them as conduits to military power and glory. A particularly telling
example is Leonardo Bruni&rsquo;s <em>History of the Florentine
People</em> (<em>Historiarum Florentinarum libri XII</em>, finished in
1442). In various ways, this work anticipates the Roman emphasis of
Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli&rsquo;s (1469&ndash;1527) main political
works (<em>The Prince</em> or <em>Il principe</em> and the
<em>Discourses on Livy</em> or <em>Discorsi sopra la prima deca di
Tito Livio</em>), with their concentration on political success
(Hankins 2019: chs. 10 and 18&ndash;20). For Machiavelli, such success
might be secured by respecting the agreed personal and communal
virtues, but could also, if necessary, be pursued without them.</p>

<h3 id="ArisOthePhilCurr">4.3 Aristotelianism and Other Philosophical Currents</h3>

<p>
In several cases, the questions explored in
 <a href="#RecoArisChri">&sect;4.2</a>
 about the compatibility of Aristotelianism with Christianity were
closely joined together with the fluctuating fortunes of other
philosophical currents from antiquity. One way of thinking about
fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Aristotelianism is as an attempt to
provide an alternative synthesis of Aristotelianism and Christianity
to that supplied by Thomas Aquinas. There were, however, notable
differences and challenges. First of all, philosophers such as
Pomponazzi argued that philosophy and theology should both operate in
autonomous spheres rather than mutually influence each other, as
Thomas thought. Secondly, the number of sources to integrate was both
far greater and more differentiated than that at Thomas&rsquo;
disposal. This section focuses on the second phenomenon and offers a
brief outline of the interplays between Aristotelianism and
Renaissance Platonism, Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Skepticism. It also
comments on the rise of anti-Aristotelianism.</p>

<p>
Initially Renaissance thinkers thought of antiquity as subscribing to
a common set of ideas with only minor variations, so that differences
were only superficial and <em>in verbis</em> (a matter of words). As
they became better acquainted with the multiple traditions of thought
from antiquity, however, they came to realize that differences ran
much deeper. This posed a number of challenges to the enterprise of
baptizing pagan philosophy, but in some cases, it also revealed that
effort to be largely futile. One positive outcome was, at times, a
more critical attitude toward all ancient philosophical currents.</p>

<h4 id="Plat">4.3.1 Platonism</h4>

<p>
The direct influence of Plato&rsquo;s writings had been limited in the
Middle Ages to just a few dialogues: the <em>Meno</em>, the
<em>Phaedo</em>, and the initial part of the <em>Timaeus</em>. During
the fifteenth century, many more of his writings appeared in Latin
translation, greatly expanding his direct influence (Kraye 1988:
349&ndash;59). Scholars debated&mdash;often vehemently&mdash;the
relative superiority of Aristotle or Plato (see, for example, the
controversy between George of Trebizond and Bessarion after 1458;
Monfasani 2021: 339&ndash;60). The full scope of Plato&rsquo;s thought
emerged from Marsilio Ficino&rsquo;s watershed Latin edition of his
works in 1484. (Translations of the Greek commentaries would follow.)
As mentioned in
 <a href="#Soul">&sect;4.2.2</a>,
 it seemed straightforward to integrate Plato&rsquo;s teachings on the
soul with Christian views, an operation encouraged by the example of
influential Church Fathers such as Augustine. (Christians found some
of Plato&rsquo;s other views, such as the community of wives and
property, rather harder to swallow; see Hankins 1990.) Ficino himself,
though trained as a scholastic philosopher, was a major architect of
the operation of bringing Aristotelianism, Platonism, and Christianity
in line with each other, as testified by his important work
<em>Platonic Theology</em> (<em>Theologia Platonica</em>). His
approach was aided by his view of a perennial philosophy of which both
the pagan and Mosaic traditions took part (Schmitt 1966). His example
enjoyed many followers. In Paris, Jacques Lef&egrave;vre
d&rsquo;&Eacute;taples (c. 1460&ndash;1536) produced a large number of
commentaries on Aristotle that offered a pious reading of the
philosopher, often by resorting to a reframing of his ideas by turning
to the more palatable Plato. In Italy, the kinsmen Alessandro and
Francesco Piccolomini were likewise keen to see the two philosophers
as complementary, rather than opposites. When Alessandro
(1508&ndash;1579) published his second, retitled version of his
vernacular treatment of Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Ethics</em> (<em>Della
institutione morale libri XII</em>, 1560), he added to
Aristotle&rsquo;s books one on love and followed it immediately with a
treatment of marriage and family. He was thus supplementing
Aristotle&rsquo;s ethical writings with a modified and Christianized
version of Plato&rsquo;s theory of love. Francesco (1523&ndash;1607),
for his part, was extremely aware of (and reported on) the
contemporary debate about what to do with Plato in his <em>A
Comprehensive Philosophy of Morals</em> (<em>Universa philosophia de
moribus</em>, 1583: 274&ndash;275). In contrast to those who thought
they needed to exalt one ancient philosopher over the other (Mario
Nizolio [1498&ndash;1566], for instance, or Francesco Patrizi da
Cherso, and their preference for Plato), he described each philosopher
as providing an indispensable eye and, therefore, ensuring correct
vision. In his own treatise, in which God and a Christian afterlife
take center stage, he modeled how ancient and Christian sources could
be combined effectively (Lines 2002: 281&ndash;285). A similar
inclination toward reconciling Plato and Aristotle can be seen in the
Spanish humanist Sebasti&aacute;n Fox Morcillo (c. 1526&ndash;1560)
and the Oxford professor John Case (1540/41?&ndash;1600). Case&rsquo;s
<em>Mirror of Moral Questions on all the Ethics of Aristotle</em>
(<em>Speculum moralium quaestionum in universam ethicen
Aristotelis</em>, 1585) treats Plato respectfully even when Aristotle
does otherwise. This sympathy may be due in part to Case&rsquo;s
desire to show that Aristotle&rsquo;s teaching on the soul accords
with Christianity (Schmitt 1983b). Likewise, in the seventeenth
century the so-called Cambridge Platonists&mdash;including prominent
personalities such as Henry More (1614&ndash;1687) and Ralph Cudworth
(1617&ndash;1688)&mdash;drew on several philosophical traditions, such
as Aristotelianism and Stoicism, in addition to Platonism, while also
giving careful consideration to issues bordering on theology, such as
the existence of God and the immortality of the soul (Kraye 1998:
1290&ndash;93).</p>

<p>
Although from a Christian perspective it seemed possible to combine
Aristotelianism and Platonism (as seen above, the operation was not
uncommon), it was harder to make Aristotelianism agree with other
philosophical schools. Such currents therefore functioned more as
alternatives than as possible complementary systems.</p>

<h4 id="Stoi">4.3.2 Stoicism</h4>

<p>
Stoic ideas circulated in the Renaissance both indirectly (through the
influential works of Cicero) and, more directly, through the genuine
and spurious writings of Seneca and through the <em>Enchiridion</em>
of Epictetus. The latter work, first translated into Latin in the
fifteenth century, became especially popular in the often-printed
rendering of Angelo Poliziano. The Spanish humanist Juan Luis Vives
(1493&ndash;1540) was a severe critic of Aristotelian ethics,
preferring the tenets of Plato and, especially, the Stoics. He claimed
in his <em>Origins, Schools, and Merits of Philosophy</em> (<em>De
initiis, sectis et laudibus philosophiae</em>, 1518) that he did not
think that there was any truer Christian than the Stoic sage.
Nonetheless, Stoicism tended to have a hard time being accepted by
thinkers (such as Erasmus and Michel de Montaigne [1533&ndash;1592])
who noted its austerity, focus on virtue alone, and problematic
attitude toward suicide (which the sect condoned). Such points made it
difficult to consider it compatible with Christianity (Kraye 1988:
367&ndash;70; Kraye 1998: 1286&ndash;90). The key figure in making
Stoic philosophy more acceptable was the Flemish humanist Justus
Lipsius (1547&ndash;1606). Lipsius provided a new edition of Seneca
(1605), preceded by his <em>Guide to Stoic Philosophy</em>
(<em>Manuductio ad Stoicam philosophiam</em>, 1604) and his <em>Stoic
Physiology</em> (<em>Physiologia Stoicorum</em>, 1604). He went to
great lengths to show how close Stoicism was to Christianity and had a
significant influence on contemporaries such as the Spaniard Francisco
de Quevedo (1580&ndash;1645), who went even further down the same
path, but praised later Stoics above Seneca (Lines &amp; Kraye 2013:
43&ndash;47).</p>

<h4 id="EpicSkep">4.3.3 Epicureanism and Skepticism</h4>

<p>
Quevedo, however, also had a strong interest in Epicureanism. Indeed,
he thought of the two philosophies as broadly similar (and compatible
with Christianity). He was one of the few in the Renaissance not to
misrepresent the philosophy of Epicurus as a beast-like dedication to
the senses and therefore something to be abhorred. In the process,
however, he made Epicurus into a believer in the afterlife (largely
because he was, again, keen to accommodate pagan philosophy with the
Christian message). In his <em>Defense of Epicurus against Commonly
Held Opinions</em> (<em>Defensa de Epicuro</em>, 1635), Quevedo was
drawing on sources that had become newly available in the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries: Book X of the <em>Lives of Philosophers</em>
by Diogenes Laertius, Lucretius&rsquo; poem <em>De rerum natura</em>,
and Sextus Empiricus. The absence of both Aristotle and Plato might be
viewed as an attempt to create an independent space for philosophical
discussion: in other words, one free from the two dominant classical
traditions but still loyal to Christian doctrine. Quevedo&rsquo;s work
was not yet an explicit critique of Aristotle such as that of his
near-contemporary Pierre Gassendi (1592&ndash;1655). Gassendi&rsquo;s
<em>Paradoxical Exercises against the Aristotelians</em>
(<em>Exercitationes paradoxicae adversus Aristoteleos</em>, 1624)
shows him rejecting Aristotle&rsquo;s essences and universals, as well
as other aspects of his philosophy; since everything we know comes to
us through the senses, but the senses are not reliable, it follows
that our knowledge is uncertain as well. Thus, Aristotle&rsquo;s
method turns out to be faulty. Gassendi&rsquo;s marriage of
Epicureanism and skepticism contributed much to making Epicurean
physics and ethics acceptable and even fashionable. Epicureanism
became a direct threat to Aristotelianism (Kraye 1998: 1293&ndash;98).
Another earlier and important attack on Aristotelianism from a skeptic
viewpoint was that of Francisco Sanches (1551&ndash;1623), whose
<em>That Nothing is Known</em> (<em>Quod nihil scitur</em>, 1581)
strongly targets the methods and conclusions of Aristotle and his
followers (Popkin 2003).</p>

<h4 id="LateAntiAris">4.3.4 Late Anti-Aristotelianism</h4>

<p>
Some of the strongest attacks on Aristotle and Aristotelianism came
toward the end of the sixteenth century in Italy (see Martin 2014:
113&ndash;120). Francesco Patrizi&rsquo;s <em>Peripatetic
Discussions</em> (<em>Discussiones peripateticae</em>, 1571 and 1581)
strongly questions the authenticity of the received Aristotelian
corpus, outlines the rise of numerous sects of divergent
interpretations, and by contrast endorses the accuracy of
Averroes&rsquo; interpretations. His <em>New Philosophy of the
Universe</em> (<em>Nova de universis philosophia</em>, 1591) outlined
the ways in which Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophy was inconsistent with
Christian principles and pointed to the usefulness of Plato instead.
Girolamo Cardano (1501&ndash;1576), Bernardino Telesio
(1509&ndash;1588), Giordano Bruno (1548&ndash;1600), and Tommaso
Campanella (1568&ndash;1639) promoted a brand of empiricist naturalism
that often relied on Epicurean, Hermetic, or astrological influences
and could stray into theologically questionable areas of pantheism and
pansensism (Copenhaver &amp; Schmitt 1992: 285&ndash;328). The
experimental and mathematical approach of Galileo Galilei
(1564&ndash;1642), along with his scientific discoveries, implicitly
challenged both Aristotelian physics and cosmology, while trying not
to appear to disrupt traditional interpretations of Scripture. The
Paduan professor Cesare Cremonini (1550&ndash;1631) indicated numerous
areas in which Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophy disagreed with
Christianity, although he insisted on his obligation to teach
Aristotle&rsquo;s text, even in areas in which it was contrary to
Christian dogma. The Italian innovators (<em>novatores</em>), together
with others like Francisco Sanches, are known to have influenced
French thinkers such as Marin Mersenne (1588&ndash;1648) and
Ren&eacute; Descartes (1596&ndash;1650), whose parting of ways with
Aristotle was perhaps less radical and momentous than they themselves
claimed.</p>

<p>
In England (unlike in Protestant Germany), several scholars were
prejudiced against Aristotelianism because of its historical ties with
Catholicism and leveled what might seem to be unjust criticisms
against it. Furthermore, several English writers, drawing on the
writings of the Dutch thinker Gerardus Johannes Vossius
(1577&ndash;1649), contended that Aristotle had improperly identified
nature with God. Francis Bacon, in his <em>De dignitate et augmentis
scientiarum</em> (1623, a Latin reworking of <em>The Advancement of
Learning</em> of 1605), noted that this perspective both unduly looked
for final causes in physics rather than in metaphysics and ignored the
greatest final cause of all (i.e., God). The outcome, he thought, was
detrimental to science. Here the distinctive position of English
thinkers needs to be kept in mind, with the double threat they
perceived from both Catholicism and anti-Trinitarianism (Martin 2014:
ch. 8).</p>

<p>
Challenges to Aristotelianism also came from other modern developments
such as international law theory. This is particularly evident with
regard to Aristotle&rsquo;s views on slavery. His <em>Politics</em>
was written in a context in which owning slaves was widespread, and he
justified the practice through the concept of &ldquo;natural
slavery&rdquo; (Book I). During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance,
this conception went largely unchallenged: slaves (especially from the
Mediterranean and northern Africa) continued to be a common sight in
cities. It was only with the Spanish activities of conquest and
enslavement in the New World that the practice was called into
question. At the famous debate of Valladolid (1550&ndash;1551), Juan
Gin&eacute;s de Sep&uacute;lveda (1490&ndash;1573) and the Dominican
Bartolom&eacute; de Las Casas (1484&ndash;1566) argued for and against
the doctrine of natural slavery respectively. Domingo de Soto
supported the doctrine, applying the <em>ius gentium</em> to the
context of the colonies. The point was not an academic one, since it
concerned the right of the Spanish crown to deprive Amerindians in
their colonies of their independence and property. However, as is well
known, arguments for emancipation led to abolitionism only in the
nineteenth century.</p>

<h2 id="SourRefeWorkDesi">5. Sources, Reference Works, and Desiderata</h2>

<p>
Our current understanding of Renaissance Aristotelianism has been
greatly aided by several valiant (but nonetheless incomplete)
bibliographical enterprises, which have provided the foundation for
many modern studies of Aristotelianism. Lohr 1988&ndash; (still
missing volume 4) is an attempt to register most medieval and
Renaissance commentaries on Aristotle in Latin, including both
manuscripts and printed editions. Arranged alphabetically by author,
the entries give the incipits and explicits of manuscript works and
provide helpful biographical and bibliographical information,
including secondary literature. Note that volume 2 (<em>Renaissance
Authors</em>, <em>1500&ndash;1650</em>) in many cases does not
reproduce the full secondary literature that was included in the
original <em>Renaissance Studies</em> and <em>Renaissance
Quarterly</em> articles from the 1970s and 1980s (see Bibliography).
It also does not include anonymous titles, and in a few rare cases
entirely misses out a significant author (such as Ulisse Aldrovandi).
Given the focus on Latin, works in the vernacular are not
considered.</p>

<p>
At the other extreme of comprehensiveness is Risse 1998, which does
not focus on Aristotelian works alone, but in principle includes all
printed philosophical works (not only commentaries) up to 1800. Risse
divides these into categories, so that all works of logic, for
instance, sit in the same volume. In each volume the entries are
arranged chronologically and are accompanied by a minimum of
bibliographical information. Works of all kinds and languages jostle
side by side. The result can be illuminating, but it is very hard to
judge from just a title whether a particular item, for example, is a
commentary, a translation, or something else. A significant drawback
is that no manuscript information is given; moreover, given the
evolution of digital bibliographical tools in recent decades, it is
likely that many items have been overlooked.</p>

<p>
There are also more specialized inventories. Cranz and Schmitt 1984
gives a chronologically ordered list of editions of Aristotle in the
sixteenth century. Again, the bibliographical details provided are
scant, but can be useful to help trace, say, the multiple editions of
a particular work. It thus has several of the drawbacks and virtues of
Risse&rsquo;s repertory. The most recent contender, Lohr 2023, follows
the standard order of the Aristotelian canon and then lists Latin
editions by first year of printing and translator. This repertory,
published posthumously, gives the reader a handy overview of the
number of printed translations of each &ldquo;Aristotelian&rdquo;
work. It rightly includes incipits and explicits for all items.
Scholars may, however, find disappointing the lack of an index of such
incipits and, especially, the decision by the editors to limit the
number of pseudographs originally included by Lohr. Nonetheless, this
volume may serve as a useful basis for further research, not least
because its chronological span is quite broad (1450 to 1650).</p>

<p>
Finally, some scholars have published more targeted repertories. In
2006 Lawrence Green published a much-updated listing of printed
Renaissance works on rhetoric (Green &amp; Murphy 2006). This is
another mammoth and useful enterprise. Although it runs the risk of
being overtaken by newer cataloguing tools, it nevertheless allows the
user to compare, say, Cicero editions and commentaries with those of
Aristotle. Green also tackled the problem of &ldquo;ghosts&rdquo; by
physically inspecting as many items as possible. Others have studied
the reception of a particular Aristotelian work in a more restricted
geographical context, such as the commentaries and other works on the
<em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> in the Italian peninsula (Lines 2002:
472&ndash;539). Even here, though, there are limitations, such as a
focus on Latin works only. That deficiency has now been addressed
through an online, freely accessible database on <em>Vernacular
Aristotelianism in Renaissance Italy, c. 1400&ndash;c. 1650</em>
 (<a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>).
 This project, now in need of updating, has offered a different
perspective on some of the various linguistic engagements with
Aristotle during the period.</p>

<p>
Although these tools can provide substantial advances for the study of
Renaissance Aristotelianism, many of its facets continue to be poorly
understood. Several other aspects require further research, including
the following:</p>

<ul>

<li>the extent to which Aristotle&rsquo;s thought was really followed
in teaching contexts</li>

<li>the effectiveness of both Catholic and Protestant ecclesiastical
authorities in containing &ldquo;heretical&rdquo; interpretations of
Aristotle&rsquo;s writings</li>

<li>the proportion between Latin and vernacular works on
Aristotle</li>

<li>the development and significance of anti-Aristotelianism</li>

<li>humanism and Aristotelianism</li>

<li>women writers on Aristotle</li>

<li>the role played by Greek scholars such as Johannes Argyropoulos
and Theodore Gaza</li>

<li>the influence of the ancient and medieval (Byzantine) Greek
commentaries</li>

<li>the changes to Aristotelianism brought about by print</li>

<li>the distinctive features of medieval and Renaissance
Aristotelianism</li>

<li>the language(s) and form(s) in which Aristotelianism was
expressed</li>
</ul>

<p>
In addition to confronting some of these issues, future research ought
to edit or translate the most significant works on Aristotle produced
in the Renaissance. Kraye 1997 already provides a helpful series of
translated extracts of philosophical works, including from
commentaries and other works on ethics and politics. More recently,
Emidio Campi and Joseph McLelland supplied an English translation of
the <em>Ethics</em> commentary of Pier Martire Vermigli (Vermigli 1563
[2006]) and Luca Baschera and Christian Moser reedited the Latin text
(Vermigli 2011), while Vittoria Perrone Compagni has produced a number
of commented Italian translations of Pomponazzi&rsquo;s works. This
kind of difficult (but indispensable) work will need to be
complemented by continuing attention to other features of
Aristotle&rsquo;s reception, including the cultural and institutional
contexts in which it took place.</p>

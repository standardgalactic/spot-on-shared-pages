<h1>Alexander of Aphrodisias</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Oct 13, 2003; substantive revision Tue Apr 23, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Alexander was a Peripatetic philosopher and commentator, active in the
late second and early third century CE. He continued the tradition of
writing close commentaries on Aristotle&rsquo;s work established in
the first century BCE by Andronicus of Rhodes, the editor of
Aristotle&rsquo;s &lsquo;esoteric&rsquo; writings, which seem to have
been designed for use in his school only. This tradition reflected a
gradual revival of interest in Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophy, beginning
in the late second century BCE, and helped to reestablish Aristotle as
an active presence in philosophical debates in later antiquity.
Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophy had fallen into neglect and disarray in
the second generation after his death and remained in the shadow of
the Stoics, Epicureans, and Academic skeptics throughout the
Hellenistic age. Andronicus&rsquo; edition of what was to become the
<em>Corpus Aristotelicum</em> consolidated a renewed interest in
Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophy, albeit in a different form: active
research was replaced by learned elucidations of The
Philosopher&rsquo;s difficult texts. The commentaries themselves
served as material for the exposition of Aristotle&rsquo;s work to a
restricted circle of advanced students. Hence each generation of
teachers produced their own commentaries, often relying heavily on
their predecessors&rsquo; work. Thus, the &lsquo;scholastic&rsquo;
treatment of authoritative texts that was to become characteristic of
the Middle Ages had already started in the first century BCE.
Alexander, due to his meticulous and philosophically astute exegesis
of a wide range of Aristotle&rsquo;s texts, in logic, physics,
psychology, metaphysics and ethical topics, became known as
<em>the</em> exemplary commentator throughout later antiquity and the
Arabic tradition. He is often referred to simply as &lsquo;The
Commentator&rsquo; (<em>ho ex&ecirc;get&ecirc;s</em>), later sharing
this title with Avicenna or Averroes. Because there is little evidence
on Alexander&rsquo;s life and activities, his commentaries and his
short treatises on topics related more or less closely to Aristotelian
doctrine provide all the information we have about him as a
philosopher and a man. As these writings show, his main contemporary
opponents were the Stoics, but there is also some evidence of a
controversy with Galen. Alexander is not only regarded as the best of
the ancient commentators but also as the last strictly Aristotelian
one, whose aim was to present and defend Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophy
as a coherent whole, well suited to engage contemporary philosophical
discussions. The later commentators were members of the Neoplatonist
schools and were concerned to document a substantial agreement of
Platonic and Aristotelian thought, and to integrate Aristotle&rsquo;s
work into their Neoplatonist philosophical system. But they continued
not only to consult and discuss, but also to criticize,
Alexander&rsquo;s work, a fact that probably accounts for its
survival.</p>

<h2 id="LifeWork">1. Life and Works</h2>

<h3 id="DateFamiTeacInfl">1.1 Date, Family, Teachers, and Influence</h3>

<p>
Next to nothing is known about Alexander&rsquo;s origin, life
circumstances, and career. His native city was (probably) the
Aphrodisias in Caria, an inland city of southwestern Asia Minor. His
father&rsquo;s name was Hermias. The only direct information about his
date and activities is the dedication of his <em>On Fate</em> to the
emperors Septimius Severus and Caracalla in gratitude for his
appointment to an endowed chair. Their co-reign lasted from 198 to 209
CE; this gives us a rough date for at least one of Alexander&rsquo;s
works. Nothing is known about his background or his education, except
that his teacher was Aristoteles of Mytilene, rather than the more
famous Aristocles of Messene, as had been conjectured by certain
scholars since the 16th. century. He is also said to have been a
student of Sosigenes and of Herminus, the pupil of the commentator
Aspasius, the earliest commentator on Aristotle whose work has in part
survived (for information concerning Alexander&rsquo;s teachers and
their philosophy, see Moraux 1984, 335&ndash;425). How much Alexander
owed to his teachers is hard to guess, for he sometimes criticizes
Sosigenes and Herminus extensively. But it is clear from the scope and
depth of his work that he was a well-trained philosopher with a broad
range of knowledge and interests.</p>

<p>
Though the dedication to the emperors tells us that Alexander was
appointed to a chair in philosophy, there is not sufficient evidence
as to whether, as is often asserted, he obtained one of the four
chairs, representing the four traditional schools, established in
Athens by Marcus Aurelius in 176 CE. There were similar established
chairs in several cities (on Athens see Lynch 1972, 192&ndash;207;
213&ndash;216). Given the amount and scope of his writing he must have
been an active teacher with a flourishing school. It is therefore
possible that some of the short essays attributed to Alexander are
actually the production of one of his collaborators or disciples. But
nothing is known about any of his associates and students (cf.
Sharples 1990a). To us his work therefore represents both the heyday
and the end of the series of commentators who explained Aristotle
exclusively on the basis of Aristotelian texts, without commitment to
some other doctrine. Alexander concludes the series of these purely
&lsquo;Peripatetic&rsquo; commentators (beginning with Andronicus of
Rhodes in the first century BCE), who try to explain &ldquo;Aristotle
by Aristotle&rdquo; (Moraux 1942, xvi, cf. Chiaradonna 2012). Though
later commentators, starting with Porphyry, the disciple and editor of
Plotinus, relied heavily on his works, they had a Neo-Platonist
approach. Since Porphyry lived considerably later than Alexander (ca.
234&ndash;305/10 CE), Alexander&rsquo;s school may have continued to
exist until it became outmoded by the &lsquo;Neo-Platonist
turn&rsquo;. Porphyry&rsquo;s report that Plotinus included texts by
Alexander &lsquo;and related authors in his discussions&rsquo;
(<em>The Life of Plotinus</em>, 14.13) makes this quite likely.
Alexander&rsquo;s commentaries formed a central part of the Arabic
tradition and were heavily used by Maimonides. His work thereby
influenced the Latin West after the revival of Aristotelianism in the
Middle Ages. The scarcity of Latin translations of Alexander&rsquo;s
commentaries suggests a certain preference for the interpretation of
the later, Neoplatonist, commentators. If William of Moerbeke confined
his translations of Alexander&rsquo;s commentaries to those on the
<em>Meteorologica</em> and the <em>De sensu</em> that may in part be
due to the availability of Boethius&rsquo; commentaries on
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Prior Analytics</em> and the <em>Topics</em>,
but it leaves unexplained why Moerbeke did not translate the
commentary on the <em>Metaphysics</em> (on the reception of Alexander
in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance see Rossi/Di Giovanni/Robiglio
2021).</p>

<h3 id="WorkTheiHist">1.2 Works and their history</h3>

<p>
As the list of his works shows, Alexander was a prolific writer. His
writings comprise both commentaries (<em>hupomn&ecirc;mata</em>) on
the works of Aristotle and several systematic treatises of his own
(including works on &lsquo;problems&rsquo;, consisting of series of
essays on different Aristotelian texts or topics). Of the
commentaries, the following are extant: <em>On Prior Analytics</em>
<em>I</em>, <em>Topics, Metaphysics, Meteorologica</em>, and <em>On
Sense Perception</em>. Of the commentary on the <em>Metaphysics</em>
only the first five books are by general consent accepted as genuine;
the remaining nine books are attributed to the late commentator
Michael of Ephesus (11th-12th century CE.). The commentary on the
<em>Sophistical Refutations</em>, ascribed to Alexander in some
manuscripts, is considered spurious. References by later commentators
show that Alexander&rsquo;s commentaries covered all of
Aristotle&rsquo;s theoretical philosophy, including his physical
writings (with the exception of the biological works). The list of his
lost works is long: there are references to commentaries on the
<em>Categories</em>, <em>De interpretation</em>e, <em>Posterior
Analytics</em>, <em>Physics</em>, and <em>On the Heavens</em>, as well
as <em>On the Soul</em> and <em>On Memory</em>. Alexander did not
write commentaries on Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Ethics</em> or
<em>Politics</em>, nor on the <em>Poetics</em> or the
<em>Rhetoric</em>. That he had quite some interest in ethical
problems, however, is witnessed by the discussions in his own
treatises. Among the extant short systematic writings the following
are regarded as genuine: <em>Problems and Solutions, Ethical Problems,
On Fate</em>, <em>On Mixture and Increase</em>, <em>On the Soul</em>
and a <em>Supplement to On the Soul</em> (dubbed &lsquo;<em>De Anima
libiri Mantissa</em>&rsquo;, lit. &lsquo;make-weight for the book of
the soul&rsquo;, by its first modern editor, I. Bruns); they not only
contain discussions of questions concerning psychology but also
problems in physics, vision and light, ethics, as well as fate and
providence. The &lsquo;Mantissa&rsquo; may not be by Alexander but a
compilation of notes by his students. The rest, <em>Medical Questions,
Physical Problems</em>, and <em>On Fevers</em> are considered
spurious. Of his lost works some have been preserved in Arabic because
they were highly influential (see D&rsquo;Ancona &amp; Serra 2002):
<em>On the Principles of the Universe</em>, <em>On Providence</em>,
<em>Against Galen on Motion</em>, and <em>On Specific
Differences</em>. Because of Alexander&rsquo;s prestige and authority
as an interpreter of Aristotle, many of his works now lost were
incorporated in the commentaries of his successors, whether they name
him or not. For example, Alexander&rsquo;s commentary on <em>On the
Heavens</em> can to some extent be reconstructed on the basis of
Themistius&rsquo; paraphrase of Aristotle&rsquo;s text and
Simplicius&rsquo; commentary. Nothing certain is known about the
relative chronology of Alexander&rsquo;s writings, but this is not an
issue of much importance, since his commentaries may well represent
the results of many years of teaching, with later insertions and
additions, in a way quite similar to Aristotle&rsquo;s own texts. This
would explain the lack of any attempt at elegance and the occurrence
of inconsistencies or unclear transitions in Alexander.</p>

<h2 id="AlexCommPhil">2. Alexander as commentator and philosopher</h2>

<p>
In general, Alexander goes on the assumption that Aristotelian
philosophy is a unified whole, providing systematically connected
answers to virtually all the questions of philosophy recognized in his
own time. Where there is no single, clearly recognizable Aristotelian
point of view on some question, he leaves the matter undecided, citing
several possibilities consistent with what Aristotle says. Sometimes
Alexander tries to force an interpretation that does not obviously
agree with the text, but he avoids stating that Aristotle contradicts
himself and, with rare exceptions, that he disagrees with him. Readers
will not always be convinced by his suggestions but they will often
find them helpful and informative where Aristotle is overly compressed
and obscure. As a remark in his commentary on the <em>Topics</em>
shows, Alexander was quite aware that his own style of philosophical
discussion was very different from that of the time of Aristotle
(<em>In top</em>. 27,13): &ldquo;This kind of speech [dialectic
refutation] was customary among the older philosophers, who set up
most of their classes in this way &mdash; not on the basis of books as
is now done, since at the time there were not yet any books of this
kind.&rdquo; As this explanation indicates, however, he seems to have
regarded the bookishness of his own time as an advantage over the
dialectic style rather than a disadvantage.</p>

<p>
Like the works of the other commentators in the ancient tradition,
Alexander&rsquo;s derive from his courses of lectures
(&lsquo;readings&rsquo;) on Aristotle&rsquo;s works. In commenting,
Alexander usually refrains from giving comprehensive surveys. He
generally starts with a preface on the work&rsquo;s title, its scope
and the nature of the subject matter. He then takes up individual
passages in rough succession by citing a line or two (this provides
the &lsquo;<em>lemma</em>&rsquo; for the ensuing discussion) and by
explaining what he considers as problematic (in explanatory
paraphrases, clarifications of expressions, or refutations of the
views of others), often in view of what Aristotle says about the issue
elsewhere. This procedure clearly presupposes that the students had
their own texts at hand and were sufficiently familiar with
Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophy as a whole. Alexander does not generally
go through the text line by line, but chooses to discuss certain
issues while omitting others. Paraphrases are interrupted by
clarifications of terminology, and sometimes, at crucial points, by
notes on divergent readings in different manuscripts and a
justification of his own preference concerning Aristotle&rsquo;s
original words. Decisions on such philological problems are based on
what makes better sense in conforming with Aristotle&rsquo;s
intentions here or elsewhere. As Alexander indicates, such
philological explorations were considered as part of the
commentator&rsquo;s work (cf. <em>On Aristotle Metaphysics</em>
<em>A</em>, 59, 1&ndash;9): &ldquo;The first reading, however, is
better; this makes it clear that the Forms are causes of the essence
for the other things, and the One for the Forms. Aspasius relates that
the former is the more ancient reading, but that it was later changed
by Eudorus and Euharmostus.&rdquo; Alexander&rsquo;s concern with
textual problems makes him a valuable source for textual criticism, as
can be seen from Kotwick&rsquo;s (2016) monograph on the text of
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Metaphysics</em>.</p>

<p>
Though Alexander follows the Aristotelian texts quite conscientiously,
he often concentrates on special points and the respective passages
while passing over others with brief remarks. Thus in his comments on
the first book of Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Metaphysics</em> he devotes
more than half of his exegesis to the two chapters in which Aristotle
attacks Plato&rsquo;s theory of Forms (<em>Metaph</em>. A, 6 &amp; 9).
Since Aristotle there focuses on Plato&rsquo;s attempt to connect the
Forms with numbers, a theory that is not elaborated in the dialogues,
Alexander&rsquo;s disquisition turns out to be our most valuable
source on the vexed question of Plato&rsquo;s Unwritten Doctrines and
also on the impact of these doctrines on the members of the Early
Academy (see Harlfinger &amp; Leszl, 1975; Fine 1993). Though on the
whole Alexander adopts Aristotle&rsquo;s critical stance towards
Plato&rsquo;s separate Forms, he sometimes at least indicates the
possibility of dissent. When, for instance, Aristotle claims that
Plato recognizes only two of his own four causes, the formal and the
material cause, Alexander refers to the demiurge&rsquo;s activities in
the <em>Timaeus</em> as a potential example for an efficient cause
acting for the sake of a final cause. But then he adds a justification
to explain why Aristotle acknowledges neither of the two causes in his
report on Plato (59,28&ndash;60,2): &ldquo;The reason is either
because Plato did not mention either of these in what he said about
the causes, as Aristotle has shown in his treatise <em>On the
Good</em>; or because he did not make them causes of the things
involved in generation and destruction, and did not even formulate any
complete theory about them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
The idea that discrepancies in Aristotle&rsquo;s texts are due to the
development of his philosophy was as alien to Alexander as it was to
all other thinkers in antiquity. Instead, he treats Aristotle&rsquo;s
philosophy as a unitary whole and tries to systematize it by forging
together different trains of thought, and smoothing over
inconsistencies. Thereby he contributed to the emergence of what was
to become the canonical &lsquo;Aristotelianism&rsquo; that was
attacked in early modern times as a severe obstacle to new ideas and
scientific development. Though Alexander indicates that he was aware
of changes at particular points (he regarded the <em>Categories</em>
as Aristotle&rsquo;s earliest work and notes that it does not yet
observe the systematic distinction between genus and species), he does
not consider the possibility that there were different phases with
substantial changes in the Master&rsquo;s work. If such conservatism
surprises us in view of the fact that Alexander&rsquo;s own work shows
traces of revisions and improvement, we must keep in mind that in the
eyes of &lsquo;The Commentator&rsquo; Aristotle was an authority quite
outside the common order. The doctrine of the Master was not the
product of an ordinary human mind, subject to trial and error, but a
magisterial achievement in a class of its own. </p>

<p>
In his systematic writings, Alexander presents an Aristotelian point
of view that also reflects in many ways the conditions and discussions
of his own time, also on questions that were not or not extensively
discussed by Aristotle himself. For example, although Alexander is
critical of Platonism, some Platonizing may be discerned in his own
writings (see below). His <em>Problems and Solutions</em>
(<em>Quaestiones</em>), in three books, are collections of short
essays, which were apparently grouped together in different books
already in antiquity. As their Greek title (<em>Physikai scholikai
aporiai kai lyseis</em>. lit. &lsquo;School-discussion of problems and
solutions on nature&rsquo;, cf. Sharples 1992, 3) indicates, these
three books address problems in natural philosophy in the broadest
sense. A fourth collection, <em>Ethical Problems</em>
(<em>&Ecirc;thika probl&ecirc;mata</em>) proceeds in a similar way. As
the lists of the essays&rsquo; titles at the beginning of each
collection show, they contain a hodgepodge of topics &ndash; such as
matter and form, causes, colours, sleep, recollection &ndash; arranged
in a quite loose order. The intellectual level of these discussions is
uneven and the titles of the treatises are sometimes misleading. Some
of the essays do present problems and solutions, but others contain
exegeses of problematic passages in Aristotle&rsquo;s texts. There are
also mere paraphrases or summaries of certain texts, collections of
arguments for a certain position, and sketches of larger projects that
were never worked out. It is unclear when and by whom these
collections were put together. As mentioned above, some of the essays
may be the work of Alexander&rsquo;s associates, or lecture-notes
taken by his students. Most interesting from our point of view are
those questions that deal with metaphysical issues, like the relation
of form and matter, or with the status of universals in general (see
section 4). Of particular interest are also those discussions in book
II that are concerned with certain aspects of Aristotle&rsquo;s
psychology, because Alexander&rsquo;s commentary on the <em>De
anima</em> is lost; they supplement his treatise <em>On the Soul</em>,
more on which below (see 3.3). Of interest are also the essays on the
notion of providence (an important topic in Alexander&rsquo;s time, in
part due to the influence of the Stoics&rsquo; focus on divine
providence). These essays defend the view that while there is no
special care for individuals, providence over the objects in the
sublunary sphere is exercised by the movement of the heavenly bodies
in the sense that they preserve the continuity of the species on
earth.</p>

<p>
Overall, Alexander himself does not signal where he departs from
Aristotle. In the past, the understanding was that he presented his
own views only in his treatises, but today scholars tend to think that
he departs from Aristotle both in his systematic works and in his
commentaries. They may not go so far as to agree with the starch
criticism of Plutarch: that Alexander, in his desire to expound his
own doctrines, and bring down Aristotle to his level, only pretended
to comment on Aristotle (about the commentary on <em>De Anima</em>,
and reported by Philoponus, <em>In dA</em> 21). They might agree with
the more appreciative version of that sentiment, however, that both
the treatises and the commentaries have philosophical significance
beyond their mere exegetical value. </p>

<h2 id="Logi">3. Logic</h2>

<p>
As his commentaries on Aristotle&rsquo;s logical works show, Alexander
was fully familiar with the development of logic after Aristotle,
under Theophrastus and the Stoics. On the whole, he presents the
Aristotelian kind of logic as the obviously right one, treating the
Stoic approach as wrong-headed. When he confronts problems in
Aristotle&rsquo;s syllogistic he sometimes expresses bafflement, and
indicates the difficulties or even inconsistencies he sees in the
text. But he usually tries to smooth them over or offers an alleged
Aristotelian solution. In any case he avoids, if at all possible,
openly criticizing Aristotle or contradicting him. As his analyses
show, Alexander was not an original logician with innovative ideas of
his own, as was his contemporary, Galen. He does not always get
Aristotle right and sometimes blunders in his exegesis. In addition,
his style is uninviting. If Aristotle is hard to comprehend on account
of his clipped and elliptic style, Alexander is often hard to follow
because of his long and tortuous periods (cf. the Introduction to his
commentary on <em>Prior Analytics I</em> in trsl. Barnes et al. 1991).
In the past this has made his commentary on the <em>Prior
Analytics</em> inaccessible to all but experts. The English
translations try to make up for these deficiencies by cutting up long
periods into shorter sentences. This will greatly enhance the
usefulness of Alexander&rsquo;s reconstruction and assessment of those
aspects of Aristotle&rsquo;s logic that are still a matter of
controversy nowadays. </p>

<p>
Besides enhancing our understanding of Aristotle, and despite their
limitations, some developments of interest to the logician may still
be found in Alexander&rsquo;s commentaries. For example, even if they
probably precede Alexander, some elements of late ancient logic seep
into his discussions, such as in the commentary on Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Topics</em>. The &ldquo;Peripatetic program&rdquo; of merging
Aristotelian and Stoic hypothetical logic shows up in his assumption
that the Stoic indemonstrables are an invention of Aristotle&rsquo;s,
in his merger of Stoic and Aristotelian hypotheticals, and in his use
of Stoic logical terminology for logical relations (Bobzien 2014).
Another example is the introduction of a new kind of premise, the
premise &lsquo;not only at a certain instant in time.&rsquo; This type
of premise seems to be reserved for statements about propria, which
always hold, although they do not belong to the essence of a
substance, and which are therefore neither described in necessity
premises, nor in contingency premises, but in categorical premises
that are true at more than one point in time (Gili 2012).</p>

<h2 id="Meta">4. Metaphysics</h2>

<p>
In Alexander&rsquo;s metaphysical writings, including his
commentaries, we find some of the major points of ancient discussion
concerning the core, not so much of metaphysics, but of Aristotelian
metaphysics. At times, Alexander seems most focused on criticizing
contemporaries from an Aristotelian perspective, and at times instead
to defend Aristotelianism by elaborating in original ways that address
possible criticisms. As an example of the former: in the treatise
<em>On Mixture and Increase</em> Alexander expands on problems that
Aristotle touched upon only briefly in <em>On Generation and
Corruption</em> I 10, but his main concern is &mdash; as it is in his
<em>On Fate</em> &mdash; to prove that the Stoic position, in this
case their account of a &lsquo;thorough&rsquo; mixture of two
substances, cannot be maintained. This treatise suggests that at the
beginning of the third century philosophical discussions between the
traditional schools were still lively. We have, of course, no other
evidence on that issue; but there would be little point in proving the
superiority of the Peripatetic doctrine, as Alexander does in <em>On
Fate</em>, in a work dedicated to the emperors, if the issue was by
general consent regarded as obsolescent. It is unlikely, therefore,
that Alexander&rsquo;s polemics are only a kind of shadow-boxing
against long-gone adversaries.</p>

<p>
As an example of the second, apologetic feature: in his commentary on
the <em>Metaphysics</em>, we find an elaboration of the question
whether metaphysics can be a demonstrative science. Alexander makes an
effort to show that it is in fact a demonstrative science in the sense
of Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Posterior Analytics</em>, i.e. with its own
genus or subject matter, axioms, and derived theorems. As part of this
effort, he understands the subject matter of metaphysics, being qua
being, as referring to all beings, insofar as they are existent
(Bonelli 2001). He also reshapes the concept of common notions, in
such a way that in metaphysics common notions may serve as axioms,
i.e. provide its fundamental principles. Common notions, which started
out, in Aristotle and later the Stoics, as shared starting points for
inquiry and argument, are expanded by Alexander to incorporate
features of dialectical starting points, points about which there is
general agreement, and scientific axioms. They are not innate, but
immediately evident to everyone, and serve as indemonstrable starting
points for scientific knowledge &mdash; the prime example for
metaphysics being the principle of non-contradiction (de Haas 2021).
</p>

<p>
Another core problem in the <em>Metaphysics</em> for ancient readers
of Aristotle, was the status of the <em>eidos</em> or form, and
especially the relation between the individual as compound of matter
and form, and the kind or species. One of the main questions
concerning this relation, inspired especially by <em>Met</em>. Z, is
whether individuals or kinds are the main substances, or, more
broadly, where we find true being. In this debate, two key positions
can be discerned, which in turn divide into varieties, roughly
corresponding to contemporary positions (Rashed 2007, Kupreeva 2010):
either individual substances are the primary beings, with their forms
providing their structures or attributes (the
&lsquo;predicative&rsquo; reading of Aristotle); or
<em>eid&ecirc;</em>, forms in the sense of kinds or species are the
primary beings, and hylomorphic compounds are substances in a
derivative sense (the &lsquo;substantialist&rsquo; reading). The
predicative reading is the one adopted by Andronicus of Rhodes and
Boethus of Sidon. A more extreme version of this view can be found in
early peripatetic philosophy, such as that of Dicaearchus, who
proposed a materialist reading of Aristotle. The substantialist view
also comes in two main varieties, which we may call
&lsquo;idealist&rsquo; and &lsquo;individualist.&rsquo; According to
the idealist view, true being is found first and foremost in the
<em>eidos</em> in the sense of the species. The species is the primary
substance, and determines the hylomorphic compound consisting of a
relation between it and indeterminate matter. We could also call this
a Platonist view. The individualist interpretation, instead, gives
priority of being to the individual <em>eidos</em> (Kupreeva 2010,
Rashed 2007).</p>

<p>
There is an ongoing debate about what precisely was Alexander&rsquo;s
view of Aristotle in this debate. Moraux (1942) stays close to the
materialist view, in suggesting that Alexander was a kind of
nominalist, based on his analysis of form in the commentary on <em>de
Anima</em>. Alexander there seems to elaborate what we may call a
&lsquo;functionalist&rsquo; element of Aristotle&rsquo;s natural
philosophy (cf. Caston 2012): form, for Alexander, is precisely what
gives a substance the power (<em>dynamis</em>) to perform certain
activities (<em>On the Soul</em> 9). More recent scholarly work has
added nuance to the discussion of Alexander&rsquo;s position, as
attempting to bring together Aristotle&rsquo;s statements about
substance in <em>Categories</em>, <em>Metaphysics</em>, and <em>de
Anima</em>. Rashed (2007), elaborating on a view discussed by Sharples
(2005), puts Alexander in the substantialist camp, by arguing for an
understanding of Alexander&rsquo;s theory of forms as an essentialism,
in the sense that forms, rather than individuals, are primary beings,
and that forms are kinds constituting the essences of individuals.
These forms should not be understood in the idealist sense, i.e. not
as unique paradigms, but as entities that may be multiplied to the
number of existing individual hylomorphic compounds. They are called
&lsquo;common&rsquo; by Alexander insofar as they are considered
separately from the material accidents of individual entities (see
below), but in themselves they are particular, and not universal like
Platonic forms, insofar as each individual has its own instantiation
of the relevant form. They are eternal insofar as they are transmitted
between generations of living beings, and they are essences in the
sense that they are the active principles &lsquo;informing&rsquo;
individual beings (corresponding to the <em>genus </em>and
<em>differentia specifica</em> in the definition). On this
interpretation, Alexander ends up between the Platonist and the
individualist camps.</p>

<p>
This brings us to two other topics of interest, namely
Alexander&rsquo;s views on universals, and on matter. With respect to
Alexander&rsquo;s discussions on universals, the established view is
that, as opposed to Aristotle, he emphatically distinguishes forms
from universals (Sirkel 2011, following Tweedale 1984). This is true
only, however, if we understand &lsquo;universal&rsquo; here as the
common concept (<em>to koinon</em>, <em>Quaestio</em> 1.3 or <em>to
katholou</em>, 1.11) which thought abstracts from particulars that in
turn are caused by an eternal and common essence, form, or nature, as
Alexander also calls it. The hylomorphically compound individual is
posterior to the form. The individuals in turn are prior to the
universal or abstracted &lsquo;common&rsquo;, or the genus.
Alexander&rsquo;s argument is that what a thing is, its form or
nature, is not dependent on there being many instances, whereas the
definition, and so the genus, are dependent on what the instances have
in common. These instances need not exist at the same time.
(<em>Quaestio</em> 1.11, 1.3, with Sirkel 2011, Rashed 2007). So
Perictione and her great-granddaughter have their individual human
nature in common, i.e. their being a human has all features in common,
even if both have features the other does not, and the common features
or the universal, which we abstract from individual humans, can be
expressed in a definition. Because this definition ultimately relies
on a correct abstraction of an eternal essence, it founds the
possibility of scientific knowledge (Rashed 2007). At the same time,
however &ndash; and this again seems to be a polemical point against
Platonism &ndash; such universals depend for their being on the
activity of intellect. If they are not thought, they are not there.
Thus universal concepts are like enmattered forms, but in intellect,
and active thoughts are their instantiations (<em>De Anima</em> 90
with Sirkel 2011; see also 3.3).</p>

<p>
What stands out in Alexander&rsquo;s writings on matter is that he is
the first to elaborate Aristotle&rsquo;s views into what became the
classic conception of prime matter. Starting from Aristotelian
inspiration, and emphasizing the distinction between simple and
compound bodies, Alexander develops his conception of prime matter
(<em>prima materia</em>, or <em>kuri&ocirc;s hul&ecirc;</em>,
&lsquo;matter properly speaking&rsquo;). Simple bodies consist only of
matter and form (as opposed to compound bodies, which consist of other
bodies), and their matter has to be formless. This prime matter cannot
exist independently of form, but it is not tied to any specific form
either. In a simple body like fire, for example, prime matter happens
to take on heat and dryness, while it could take on their opposites
just as well (<em>On the Soul</em> 4&ndash;5, see also Caston 5 and
n.16). This feature of having the capacity of taking on opposite
attributes in turn, poses a problem for the heavens, which do not
share this feature, yet have to have a material substrate in order to
be natural, i.e. inherently moving. Distinguishing heavenly matter
from sublunary matter, however, which Aristotle also required for
safeguarding the incorruptible nature of the heavens, results in the
issue that the prime matter underlying the sublunary world is no
longer unqualified. Alexander solves this (logical) problem by stating
that the difference between the two is not qualitative: matter, both
below and beyond the moon, is the ultimate unqualified substrate;
being capable of receiving opposites in turn is not a quality of
sublunary matter in the sense of a differentia distinguishing one
species of matter from another (<em>Quaestio</em> 1.10, 1.15, with
Rashed 2007). Although Alexander does not say this explicitly, the
underlying thought seems to be that ultimately receiving opposites is
not a necessary attribute of sublunary matter, but a contingent one.
The best definition of prima materia, then, for Alexander, is that it
is the unqualified substrate.</p>

<p>
As we will see, Alexander&rsquo;s views on these features of
hylomorphism are important for his understanding of the relation
between soul and body, and at times are elaborated with that relation
specifically in mind. </p>

<h2 id="Psyc">5. Psychology</h2>

<p>
In the realm of psychology, Alexander again in general elaborates on
Aristotle, while also responding to challenges offered by other
contemporary schools. His most interesting contributions concern the
relation between soul and body, and the nature of the intellect.
Especially the latter had a very long shadow, that has only recently
been recognized as a shadow thrown by Alexander, rather than
Aristotle. Alexander&rsquo;s naturalist approach in psychology is
revealed in his treatment of the human soul as the perishable form
imposed upon the bodily elements to constitute a living human being.
Aristotelian psychology, according to which the soul is a form of the
body, has to maneuver between the Scylla of Platonism and the
Charybdis of reducing soul to a mere attribute of the body. According
to Platonic dualism, body and soul are both substances in the sense of
independent beings, which was unacceptable for Aristotle for a couple
of reasons, among which primarily the fact that the independence of
soul had to be reconciled with its role as formal cause. Understanding
the soul in a functionalist sense, however, risks reducing the soul to
an accident, which means robbing it of the possibility of being the
cause of activity, a source of motion. Alexander finds a safe course
between the two, by conceiving of forms as causal powers or
dispositions of substances (see above), and by viewing the soul as
supervening on the body. This means that a specific type of soul fits
only a body made of a certain kind of mixture, i.e. a body that is
suitable to performing certain functions, and that it supervenes on
the body which is its sufficient condition. The ontological priority
of soul or form over body is still guaranteed by the fact that the
soul is not the mixture of bodily elements, but the causal power that
emerges in it (Caston 2012).</p>

<p>
The most debated aspect of Alexander&rsquo;s psychology is no doubt
his theory of the intellect. There are some problems regarding the
consistency between and within <em>On the Soul</em> and
<em>Mantissa</em> but we will here assume that they contain the same
theory, albeit with different emphases and within different contexts.
One of the most interesting elements of that theory, also in light of
its later reception, is the elaboration of Aristotle&rsquo;s passive
and active intellect (<em>dA</em> 3.5). Aristotle, after introducing
the intellect and its capacities in <em>de Anima</em> 3.4, in 3.5
presents a distinction of two kinds of intellect: passive and active.
The passive is also called material and potential, the active is also
called productive, separable, impassible and unmixed, immortal and
eternal. There are as many readings of this distinction as there are
readers, with the differences centering around the following
questions: how do active and passive intellect relate? And is
Aristotle separating two aspects of the human intellect, or is he
instead distinguishing human from divine intellect?</p>

<p>
With respect to that last question, and this may well be his most
influential interpretation of Aristotle, Alexander chooses the second
option: the passive intellect is the one found in humans, but the
active intellect is transcendent and divine (although there is a sense
in which the human intellect can be called active, and productive,
rather than passive, see below). The passive or material intellect is
also &ldquo;natural&rdquo;, because it is found in all healthy humans
(<em>On the Soul</em> 81). It is tied to the corporeal world in two
ways: it is focused upon enmattered forms, in its laying hold of the
universal as the common feature of particulars (<em>On the Soul</em>
83, <em>Mantissa</em> 110), and it is embodied in the sense that it is
a capacity of the soul which is a form of a human body. This is not
why it is called material, however. &lsquo;Material&rsquo; in this
context refers to the other standard meaning of matter, i.e. of being
a substrate, because the material intellect is purely receptive.
Following Aristotle, Alexander argues that all forms are objects of
intellect, and if the intellect had any form itself, that form would
interfere with its intellectual reception of other forms (<em>On the
Soul</em> 84, <em>Mantissa</em> 106&ndash;7; it is moreover receptive
in two manners: as receiving the theoretical and the practical
disposition). It is therefore nothing in actuality, but potentially
everything, which is why it is also called the potential intellect.
Aristotle&rsquo;s analogy of the empty writing tablet (<em>dA</em>
429b30&ndash;430a2) therefore has to be understood, according to
Alexander, not as emphasizing that the material intellect is analogous
to the tablet, but to its emptiness: it is a condition or an aptitude
of the soul (<em>On the Soul</em> 84).</p>

<p>
For a further stage of development of the potential intellect,
Alexander introduces a separate term: once it has reached its first
actualization, or fully developed its natural capacity, the material
intellect may be called the &ldquo;dispositional intellect.&rdquo;
This label refers to the disposition reached by the acquisition of
scientific understanding (epist&ecirc;m&ecirc;). This stage is also
called &ldquo;common&rdquo;, as not all humans reach it, but most do
at least reach a certain degree of such universal and synthetic
knowledge (<em>On the Soul</em> 82, <em>Mantissa</em> 107), or
knowledge of essences as expressed in definitions (<em>On the
Soul</em> 87). The final stage of development is the second
actualization, when the intellect actively engages in intellectual
acts, and becomes that which it knows. It is then itself intellect in
act, and it knows and becomes intelligibles in act (as opposed to the
potential intelligibles, i.e. enmattered forms), so in this sense it
may be said to know itself (<em>On the Soul</em> 87&ndash;8,
<em>Mantissa</em> 108). As creating the very intelligibles it knows,
it may moreover be called active and productive, rather than passive,
to distinguish it from the senses (<em>Mantissa</em> 111). The
intelligibles in act, although analogous to the enmattered forms, are
quite emphatically described by Alexander as a different kind of forms
(Guyomarc&rsquo;h 2023). </p>

<p>
There is a tension in Alexander&rsquo; view of the material intellect,
as it seems to combine complete receptivity, and hence passivity, with
some kind of cognitive activity, to begin with abstraction. The role
of receptivity guarantees the objectivity of our abstractions, but it
is not quite clear how intellection starts (Tuominen 2010). In some
interpretations, Alexander tries to solve this problem using the
active intellect and what Guyomarc&rsquo;h calls the Principle of
Maximal Causality. That principle is a metaphysical argument with
roots in Plato, but also present in Aristotle, which assumes that for
all degrees of a property, there has to be something which has that
property to the fullest, and that that something has to be the cause
of the lower degrees (cf. Guyomarc&rsquo;h 2023). So Alexander states
that besides the human intellect developing from potentiality to
actuality, there has to be an intellect that is always already
essentially in act, preceding all potentiality (cf. Aristotle
<em>Met</em>. 12). This active or productive intellect is the most
intelligible form (<em>On the Soul</em> 88&ndash;90, <em>Mantissa</em>
107&ndash;110, 113), and because it is immaterial, it also has a
separable or separate existence, and is impassible and unmixed,
immortal and eternal. Alexander thus has the active intellect
transcend the human soul, and rules out personal immortality by
identifying this separate active intellect, mentioned by Aristotle in
<em>De anima</em> 3.5, with pure form and with God, the divine
intellect from Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Met.</em> 12, and possibly even
with the Good from Plato&rsquo;s <em>Republic</em>, as the cause of
all goodness, knowledge and being (<em>On the Soul</em> 89&ndash;90
with Caston 1999, Fotinis 1979, Guyomarc&rsquo;h 2023).</p>

<p>
How, according to Alexander, this active intellect and the human,
passive intellect are related, is not an easy question to answer. It
seems clear, however, that the active intellect is a necessary
condition for development in the potential intellect, whose pure
potentiality prevents it from being the agent that starts its own
cognitive process. Three main interpretations have been offered for
the causal role of the active intellect: that it is an efficient
cause, that it is a final cause, and that it is both (for the latter
see Nyvlt 2012 and Schroeder 2014). That Alexander calls the active
intellect the productive (poietikos) cause of all other intelligibles,
is the main argument for understanding it as the efficient cause of
intellection. This reading is problematic, however, insofar as it
would require the active intellect to focus on something other than
thinking itself &ndash; and therefore render it a potential intellect
to some extent. For the view that it is merely the final cause
(Tuominen 2006, de Haas 2021, Guyomarc&rsquo;h 2023), pleads
Alexander&rsquo;s claim that the intellect &ldquo;from outside&rdquo;
(<em>thurathen</em>) is the cause of our knowing because as pure form
it is the ultimate object of our intellection, and as pure act the
ultimate paradigm, which confers on our material intellect the
disposition to think what is potentially intelligible: &ldquo;it does
not make [our intellect] intellect, but by its own nature perfects the
intellect that exists [already] and leads it to the things that are
proper to it&rdquo; (<em>Mantissa</em> 111&ndash;2). This notion of
the intellect &ldquo;from outside&rdquo; is taken from
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>On Generation of Animals</em> 437b, where it is
meant to solve the problem of the emergence of the soul, and
especially the rational powers, in embryos: only intellect, Aristotle
says, does not at some point arise in the development of the embryo,
but somehow comes &ldquo;from outside&rdquo; and is divine. Following
Platonist criticisms of Peripatetic discussions of that emergence,
Alexander elaborates and interprets the &ldquo;intellect from
outside&rdquo; in an original manner, as referring to the transcendent
divinity and the prior and independent existence of the intellect in
act, with respect to our intellects and cognition. This intellect is
present in us from outside, only in the sense that when we think (of)
the active intellect, our intellect thereby becomes the active
intellect &ldquo;in some way&rdquo; (<em>On the Soul</em> 89). This
does not mean that the active intellect itself is somehow present in
us, except analogously, as object and hence state of our thought. It
is then, that we are closest to the divine (<em>On the Soul</em> 91,
<em>Mantissa</em> 113; on the notion &ldquo;from outside&rdquo; in
Alexander see also Roreitner 2023, Guyomarc&rsquo;h 2023, de Haas
2021, Opsomer and Sharples 2000, Schroeder and Todd 1990). A problem
for this interpretation is that it is still not clear how our
initially purely potential intellect kicks into gear. A possible
solution would be that the initial stages of development in the
intellect are passive, due to the repeated reception of enmattered
forms through repeated reception, and that the first grasping of the
universal (as described in <em>An. Post.</em> II 19), as immaterial
and intelligible form, is the moment our intellect intelligizes the
divine active intellect by becoming an active intellect itself (cf. de
Haas 2021). </p>

<h2 id="EthiFate">6. Ethics and Fate</h2>

<p>
Since Alexander did not write a commentary on Aristotle&rsquo;s
ethics, his <em>Ethical Problems</em>, despite their somewhat
disorganized state, are of considerable interest (cf. Madigan 1987;
Sharples 1990; 2001, 2). For, apart from parts of Aspasius&rsquo;
early commentary on the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> there are no
extant commentaries on Aristotle&rsquo;s ethics before the composite
commentary by various hands of the Byzantine age (Michael of Ephesus
in the 11th/12th c. and his contemporary Eustratius, together with
some material extracted from earlier authors, cf. Sharples 1990,
6&ndash;7, 95). This gap may suggest that ethics had become a marginal
subject in later antiquity. Alexander&rsquo;s <em>Ethical
Problems</em> are therefore the only link between Aspasius and the
medieval commentaries. His essays are moreover worth studying because
many of the &lsquo;questions&rsquo; address central issues in ancient
ethics. Some, for instance, are concerned with the notion of pleasure
as a good and pain as an evil; with pleasure as a supplement of
activity supporting its connection with happiness; with the relation
supervening upon it and between virtues and vices; with virtue as a
mean; and with the concept of the involuntary and the conditions of
responsibility. Alexander&rsquo;s discussions confirm not only his
thorough familiarity with Aristotle&rsquo;s ethics, but also reflect
the debates of the Peripatetics with the Epicureans and Stoics in
Hellenistic times, as shown especially by the terminology he uses, as
well as debates within the Peripatetic school. For example, he
elaborates on pain as, like pleasure, a supplement of activity, but
with a reverse value in respect to the activity (pain accompanying bad
activities is good), in what is apparently a debate between a
pleasure-friendly and a pleasure-hostile trend in the Peripatetic
school (cf. Cheng 2014). In discussing such ethical problems,
Alexander pays special attention to logical and (meta)physical
aspects, as in this case the supervenience and causality of pleasure.
This approach may be explained from the Hellenistic context in which
he is working, and the (often implicit) debates of his time. Another
example is his discussion of the coming to be of opposites not from
each other, but from privation as an intermediate state, starting from
the relation between justice and injustice (<em>Eth.</em> <em>Pr.</em>
30, possibly to underpin the anti-Stoic thesis of <em>Eth. Pr.</em>
3).</p>

<p>
The best example of Alexander&rsquo;s procedure is his construal of an
Aristotelian conception of fate in the treatise <em>On Fate</em>. This
essay, though not easy to read, is probably the most interesting for a
general public (cf. Sharples 1983 and 2001, 1). Not only is it the
most comprehensive surviving document in the centuries-long debate on
fate, determinism, and free will that was carried on between the
Stoics, the Epicureans and the Academic Skeptics, it also contains
some original suggestions and points of criticism, as a comparison
with Cicero&rsquo;s <em>On Fate</em> would show. It is unclear whether
there had been a genuinely Peripatetic contribution to this debate
before Alexander, although the fact that Justin Martyr, his slightly
older contemporary, uses much the same terminology, suggests that they
may have been inspired by a common source. In any case, Alexander
appears to have filled a significant gap in the Peripatetic school.
Though Aristotle himself in a way touches on all important aspects of
the problem of determinism &mdash; logical, physical, and ethical
&mdash; in different works, he was not greatly concerned with this
issue, nor does he entertain the notion of fate
(<em>heimarmen&ecirc;</em>) as a rational cosmic ordering-force, as
the Stoics did. In <em>De interpretatione</em> 9, he famously proposed
to solve the problem of &lsquo;future truth&rsquo; by suspending
truth-values for statements in the future tense concerning individual
contingent events. In his ethics he deals with the question of whether
individuals have free choice, once their character is settled. As
Aristotle sees it, there is little or no leeway, but he holds
individuals responsible for their actions because they collaborated in
the acquisition of their character (<em>EN</em> III, 1&ndash;5). In
his physical works Aristotle limits strict necessity to the motions of
the stars, while allowing for a wide range of events in the sublunary
realm that do not happen of necessity but only for the most part or
accidentally (<em>Phys</em>. II, 4&ndash;6). Though he subscribes to
the principle that the same causal constellations have the same
effects, he also allows for &lsquo;fresh starts&rsquo; in a causal
series (<em>Metaph</em>. E 3). Given these various limitations,
Aristotle had no reason to treat determinism as a central
philosophical problem either in his ethics or in his physics. The
situation changed, however, once the Stoics had established a
rigorously physicalist system ordered by an all-pervasive divine mind.
It is this radicalization of the determinist position that sharpened
the general consciousness of the problematic, as witnessed by the
relentless attacks on the Stoics by their opponents, most of all by
the Academic skeptics and the Epicureans, which lasted for
centuries.</p>

<p>
This long-standing debate prompted Alexander to develop an
Aristotelian concept of fate by identifying it with the natural
constitution of things, including human nature (<em>On Fate</em>, ch.
2&ndash;6). Since there is always the possibility that something
happens against the natural and normal order of things, there are
exceptions to what is &lsquo;fated&rsquo; and there is room for chance
and the fortuitous. Most of the treatise is occupied not with the
defense of this Peripatetic position, but rather with attacks on the
various aspects of the determinist position. Alexander claims to show
why the Stoics&rsquo; attempt (though he nowhere names them) to defend
a compabilitist position must fail. The determinists, he says, are
neither entitled to maintain a coherent concept of luck and the
fortuitous, nor of contingency and possibility, nor of deliberation
and potency. The bulk of this polemical discussion concentrates on the
difficulties for the Stoic position by claiming that their concept of
fate makes human deliberation superfluous and therefore imports
disastrous consequences for human morality and life in general (chs.
7&ndash;21). Alexander also presents, albeit in a dialectical fashion
intended to lead to the defeat of the Stoic tenets, the arguments used
by the Stoics in their defense of contingency, chance, and human
responsibility. As he claims time and again, the Stoics can defend the
use of these terms at best in a verbal sense. In addition, their
notion of divine foreknowledge and prophecy turns out to be incoherent
(chs. 22&ndash;35). The stringency and originality of
Alexander&rsquo;s critique cannot be discussed here (cf. Sharples
1983; Bobzien 1998; Adamson 2018). While his presentation is not free
from repetition and while the order of the arguments leaves something
to be desired, it is an interesting text that displays a lively
engagement with the issues and quite some philosophical
sophistication. He argues that truly free action requires that at the
time one acts, it is open to one both to do and not to do what one
does in fact then do. Thus Alexander originates the position later
known as &lsquo;libertarianism&rsquo; in the theory of free action.
Alexander&rsquo;s construction of an Aristotelian account of fate and
divine providence that limits them to nature and its overall benign
order clearly argues for a weak conception of fate; but it is the only
one that Alexander regards as compatible with the principles of
Aristotelian philosophy of nature and ethics. That the concept of fate
greatly intrigued him is confirmed by the fact that he returns to the
issue in his <em>Supplement</em> (henceforth <em>Mantissa</em>) to the
treatise <em>On the Soul</em> and in some of his <em>Problems</em>
(2.4.5, cf. Sharples 1983, esp. the Introduction).</p>

<h2 id="ImpoInfl">7. Importance and Influence</h2>

<p>
There is no information concerning the impact of Alexander&rsquo;s
teaching in his lifetime. But certain indications of critical attacks
on his contemporary Galen (129&ndash;216 CE), for example of his
criticism of Aristotle&rsquo;s unmoved mover, suggest that he was
engaged in controversy with other contemporaries as well. Whether his
polemics against contemporary versions of Stoic doctrine were part of
a personal exchange or rather a bookish exercise is unclear. If
Alexander held the chair of Peripatetic philosophy at Athens it is
quite possible that he was in direct contact with the incumbents of
the other philosophical chairs there. He was, of course, not the first
commentator on Aristotle. But posterior exegetes certainly treated as
exemplary his method and his standards for explaining problems and
obscurities in Aristotle&rsquo;s texts. This is indicated both by
explicit references in later commentators, and by the unacknowledged
exploitation of his work in some extant later commentaries on the same
texts, as well as in systematic writings &ndash; including some in the
Platonic schools, as shows from the use of Alexandrian material by
Platonists such as Plotinus and Syrianus (for examples see Chiaradonna
2012). As the translations of his work into Arabic and, to a lesser
degree, into Latin show, he continued to be treated as a leading
authority and his work influenced the Aristotelian tradition
throughout late antiquity, the Middle Ages, and in the Renaissance
(see Rossi/Di Giovanni/Robiglio 2021). In the modern age interest in
Alexander, both as a commentator and as a philosopher, was greatly
enhanced when, under the general editorship of Hermann Diels, the
<em>Commentaria in Aristotelem Graeca</em> (together with the
many-volumed <em>Suppelementum Aristotelicum</em>) were published by
the Prussian Academy of Science between 1882&ndash;1909. Scholars
nowadays continue to make use of his commentaries, not only for
historical reasons but also because his suggestions are often worth
considering in their own right. Because in recent years much more
attention has been paid to the philosophers in late antiquity, not
only to the Neo-Platonists, Alexander&rsquo;s work has come under
detailed scrutiny in various respects by specialists, as witnessed by
an increase in publications both on general and on special aspects of
his exegetical and philosophical work. The accessibility of most of
his writings in translations makes apparent to a more general
readership that Alexander&rsquo;s work is not only relevant for
specialists in the history of philosophy, but opens up an interesting
age of transition in the history of philosophical and scientific
ideas.</p>

<h1>Quantum Computing</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Sun Dec 3, 2006; substantive revision Tue Mar 5, 2024</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Combining physics, mathematics and computer science, quantum computing
and its sister discipline of
 <a href="../qt-entangle/">quantum information</a>
 have developed in the past few decades from visionary ideas to two of
the most fascinating areas of quantum theory. General interest and
excitement in quantum computing was initially triggered by P. W. Shor
(1994) who showed how a quantum algorithm apparently can factor large
numbers into primes far more efficiently than any known classical
algorithm. Shor&rsquo;s algorithm was soon followed by several other
algorithms for solving combinatorial and algebraic problems, and in
the years since the theoretical study of quantum computational systems
has achieved tremendous progress. Although no proof exists yet for the
general superiority of quantum computers over classical computers, the
implementation of Shor&rsquo;s algorithm on a large scale quantum
computer would render ineffective currently widely used cryptosystems
that rely on the premise that no efficient algorithm for factoring
exists. Consequently, experimentalists around the world are engaged in
attempts to tackle the technological difficulties that prevent the
realisation of a large scale quantum computer.</p>

<p>
The philosophical interest in quantum computing is manifold. From a
social-historical perspective, quantum computing is a domain where
experimentalists find themselves ahead of their fellow theorists.
Indeed, quantum mysteries such as
 <a href="../qt-entangle/">entanglement</a>
 and
 <a href="../qt-epr/">nonlocality</a>
 were historically considered to be of &ldquo;merely
philosophical&rdquo; interest until physicists discovered that these
mysteries might be harnessed to devise new efficient algorithms. But
while the technology for harnessing the power of hundreds of qubits
(the basic unit of information in the quantum computer) is now within
reach, only a handful of quantum algorithms exist, and the question of
whether these can truly outperform any conceivable classical
alternative is still, for theoreticians, open.</p>

<p>
From a foundational point of view, reflecting on features of the
design and implementation of efficient quantum algorithms may help us
to better understand just what it is that makes quantum systems
quantum, and it may illuminate fundamental concepts such as
 <a href="../qt-issues/">measurement</a>
 and
 <a href="../causation-mani/">causality</a>.
 Further, the idea that abstract mathematical concepts such as
<em>computability</em> and <em>complexity</em> may not only be
translated into physics, but also <em>re-written</em> by physics bears
directly on the autonomous character of computer science and the
status of its theoretical entities&mdash;the so-called
&ldquo;computational kinds&rdquo;. As such it is also relevant to the
long-standing philosophical debate on the relationship between
mathematics and the physical world.</p>

<h2 id="BrieHistFiel">1. A Brief History of the Field</h2>

<h3 id="PhysCompComp">1.1 Physical Computational Complexity</h3>

<p>
A mathematical model for a universal computer was defined long before
the invention of quantum computers and is called the
 <a href="../turing-machine/">Turing machine</a>.
 It consists of (a) an unbounded tape divided (in one dimension) into
cells, (b) a &ldquo;read-write head&rdquo; capable of reading or
writing one of a finite number of symbols from or to a cell at a
specific location, and (c) an instruction table (instantiating a
transition function) which, given the machine&rsquo;s initial
&ldquo;state of mind&rdquo; (one of a finite number of such states
that can be visited any number of times in the course of a
computation) and the input read from the tape in that state,
determines (i) the symbol to be written to the tape at the current
head position, (ii) the subsequent displacement (to the left or to the
right) of the head, and (iii) the machine&rsquo;s final state. In 1936
Turing (1936) showed that since one can encode the instruction table
of any given Turing machine \(T\) as a binary number \(\#(T)\), there
exists a universal Turing machine \(U\) which, upon reading a given
\(\#(T)\) from its tape, can simulate the operation of \(T\) on any
input.</p>

<p>
In mathematics, an <em>effective method</em>, informally speaking, is
a method consisting of a finite number of precise finite-length
instructions, guaranteed to produce some desired result in a finite
number of steps if followed exactly by a human being using nothing
other than paper and pencil (Papayannopoulos 2023). That the Turing
machine model formally captures the concept of effective calculability
in its entirety is the essence of the
 <a href="../church-turing/">Church-Turing thesis</a>.
 Since the thesis involves both a precise mathematical notion (i.e.,
that of a Turing machine) and an informal and intuitive notion (i.e.,
that of an effective method), however, strictly speaking it cannot be
proved or disproved but is arguably best thought of as an explication
in Carnap&rsquo;s sense (Carnap 1962, ch. I).</p>

<p>
Simple cardinality considerations show, in any case, that not all
functions are Turing-computable (the set of all Turing machines is
countable, while the set of all functions from the natural numbers to
the natural numbers is not), and the discovery of this fact came as a
complete surprise in the 1930s (Davis 1958). But as interesting and
important as the question of whether a given function is computable by
Turing machine&mdash;the purview of computability theory (Boolos,
Burgess, &amp; Jeffrey 2007)&mdash;is, it is not the only question
that interests computer scientists. Beginning especially in the 1960s
(Cobham 1965; Edmonds 1965; Hartmanis &amp; Stearns 1965), the
question of the <em>cost</em> of computing a function also came to be
of great importance. This cost, also known as
 <a href="../computational-complexity/">computational complexity</a>,
 is measured naturally in terms of the physical resources (in
particular time and space, given in terms of computational steps and
memory locations, respectively) required in order to solve the
computational problem at hand. Computer scientists classify
computational problems according to the way their cost function
behaves as a function of their input size, \(n\) (the number of bits
required to store the input). <em>Tractable</em>, or efficiently
solvable, problems are those that can be solved in &ldquo;polynomial
time&rdquo;; i.e., in a number of time steps that is bounded by a
polynomial function of the size of the input, while
<em>intractable</em> problems are those which cannot, i.e., that
require &ldquo;exponential&rdquo; time.</p>

<p>
For a <em>deterministic Turing machine</em> (DTM) like the ones we
have been discussing so far, its behaviour at any given time is wholly
determined by its state plus whatever its input happens to be. In
other words such machines have a unique transition function. We can
generalise the Turing model, however, by allowing a machine to
instantiate more than one transition function simultaneously. A
<em>nondeterministic Turing machine</em> (NTM), upon being presented
with a given input in a given state, is allowed to
&lsquo;choose&rsquo; which of its transition functions to follow, and
we say that it solves a given problem whenever, given some input,
there exists at least one path through its state space leading to a
solution. Exactly how an NTM &ldquo;chooses&rdquo; whether to follow
one transition function rather than another at a given moment in time
is left undefined (Turing originally conceived these choices as those
of an external operator). In particular, we do not assume that any
probabilities are attached to these choices. In a <em>probabilistic
Turing machine</em> (PTM), by contrast, we characterise the
computer&rsquo;s choices by associating a particular probability with
each of its possible transitions.</p>

<p>
Probabilistic and deterministic Turing machines (DTMs) have different
success criteria. A successful deterministic algorithm for a given
problem is guaranteed to yield the correct answer given its input. Of
a successful probabilistic algorithm, on the other hand, we only
demand that it yield a correct answer with &ldquo;high&rdquo;
probability (minimally, we demand that it be strictly greater than
1/2). It was generally believed, until relatively recently, that for
some problems (see, e.g. Rabin 1976) probabilistic algorithms are
dramatically more efficient than any deterministic alternative; in
other words that the set or &ldquo;class&rdquo; of problems
efficiently solvable by PTM is larger than the class of problems
efficiently solvable by DTM. It is now generally believed that the PTM
model does not, in fact, offer a computational advantage in this sense
over the DTM model (Arora &amp; Barak 2009, ch. 20). Probabilistic
(Turing) computation is nevertheless interesting to consider, because
abstractly a <em>quantum</em> computer is just a variation on the PTM
that <em>does</em> appear to offer computational advantages over
deterministic computation, although as already mentioned this
conjecture still awaits a proof.</p>

<p>
The class \(\mathbf{P}\) (for Polynomial) is the class containing all
the computational decision problems that can be solved by a DTM in
polynomial time. The class <strong>NP</strong> (for Non-deterministic
Polynomial) is the class containing all the computational decision
problems that can be solved by an NTM in polynomial
 time.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 The most famous problems in <strong>NP</strong> are called
&ldquo;<strong>NP</strong>-complete&rdquo;, where
&ldquo;complete&rdquo; designates the fact that these problems stand
or fall together: Either they are all tractable, or none of them is!
If we knew how to solve an <strong>NP</strong>-complete problem
efficiently (i.e., with polynomial cost) we could use it to
efficiently solve any other problem in <strong>NP</strong> (Cook
1971). Today we know of hundreds of examples of
<strong>NP</strong>-complete problems (Garey &amp; Johnson 1979), all
of which are reducible one to another with no more than a polynomial
slowdown. Since the best known algorithm for any of these problems is
exponential, the widely believed conjecture is that there is no
polynomial algorithm that can solve them. Clearly \(\mathbf{P}
\subseteq \mathbf{NP}\). Proving or disproving the conjecture that
\(\mathbf{P} \ne \mathbf{NP}\), however, remains perhaps one of the
most important open questions in computer science. The class
<strong>BPP</strong> (bounded probabilistic polynomial) is the class
of problems that can be solved in polynomial time with
&ldquo;high&rdquo; probability (see above) by a PTM. Finally, the
class <strong>BQP</strong> is the class of problems that can be solved
in polynomial time with &ldquo;high&rdquo; probability by a quantum
computer. From the perspective of computer science, answering the
question of whether quantum computers are more powerful than classical
computers amounts to determining whether <span class="nw"><strong>BPP</strong>
\(\subsetneq\) <strong>BQP</strong></span> is true (see Cuffaro 2018b).</p>

<p>
Although the original Church-Turing thesis involves the
<em>abstract</em> mathematical notion of computability, physicists as
well as computer scientists often interpret it as saying something
about the scope and limitations of <em>physical</em> computing
machines. Wolfram (1985) claims that any physical system can be
simulated (to any degree of approximation) by a universal Turing
machine, and that complexity bounds on Turing machine simulations have
physical significance. For example, if the computation of the minimum
energy of some system of \(n\) particles requires at least an
exponentially increasing number of steps in \(n\), then the actual
relaxation of this system to its minimum energy state will also take
exponential time. Aharonov (1999) strengthens this thesis (in the
context of showing its putative incompatibility with quantum
mechanics) when she says that a PTM can simulate any reasonable
physical device at polynomial cost.</p>

<p>
In order for the &ldquo;physical Church-Turing thesis&rdquo; to make
sense one has to relate physical space and time parameters to their
computational counterparts: memory capacity and number of computation
steps, respectively. There are various ways to do that, leading to
different formulations of the thesis (see Copeland 2018; Gandy 1980;
Pitowsky 1990; Sieg &amp; Byrnes 1999). For example, one can encode
the set of instructions of a universal Turing machine and the state of
its infinite tape in the binary development of the position
coordinates of a single particle. Consequently, one can physically
&lsquo;realise&rsquo; a universal Turing machine as a billiard ball
with hyperbolic mirrors (Moore 1990; Pitowsky 1996).</p>

<p>
It should be stressed that strictly speaking there is no relation
between the original Church-Turing thesis and its physical version
(Pitowsky &amp; Shagrir 2003), and while the former concerns the
concept of computation that is relevant to logic (since it is strongly
tied to the notion of <em>proof</em> which requires
<em>validation</em>), it does not analytically entail that
<em>all</em> computations should be subject to validation. Indeed,
there is a long historical tradition of analog computations (Dewdney
1984; Maley 2023; Papayannopoulos 2020), and the output of these
computations is validated either by repetitive &ldquo;runs&rdquo; or
by validating the physical theory that presumably governs the
behaviour of the analog computer.</p>

<h3 id="PhysShorCutsComp">1.2 Physical &ldquo;Short-cuts&rdquo; of Computation</h3>

<p>
Do physical processes exist which contradict the physical
Church-Turing thesis? Apart from analog computation, there exist at
least two main kinds of example purporting to show that the notion of
recursion, or Turing-computability, is not a natural <em>physical</em>
property (Hogarth 1994; Pitowsky 1990; Pour-el &amp; Richards 1981).
Although the physical systems involved (a specific initial condition
for the wave equation in three dimensions and an exotic solution to
Einstein&rsquo;s field equations, respectively) are somewhat
contrived, a school of &ldquo;hypercomputation&rdquo; that aspires to
extend the limited examples of physical &ldquo;hypercomputers&rdquo;
and in so doing to physically &ldquo;compute&rdquo; the
non-Turing-computable has nevertheless emerged (Andr&eacute;ka,
Madar&aacute;sz, N&eacute;meti, N&eacute;meti, &amp; Sz&eacute;kely
2018; Copeland 2002, 2011; Davis 2003). <em>Quantum</em>
hypercomputation is less frequently discussed in the literature (see,
e.g., Adamyan, Calude, &amp; Pavlov 2004), but arguably the most
concrete attempt to harness quantum theory to compute the
non-computable is the suggestion to use the quantum adiabatic
algorithm (see below) to solve Hilbert&rsquo;s Tenth Problem (Kieu
2002, 2004)&mdash;a Turing-undecidable problem equivalent to the
halting problem&mdash;though this alleged quantum adiabatic
hypercomputer has been criticised as unphysical (see Hagar &amp;
Korolev 2007; Hodges 2005 [Other Internet Resources]).</p>

<p>
Setting aside hypercomputers, even if we restrict ourselves only to
Turing-computable functions, one can still find many proposals in the
literature that purport to display &ldquo;short-cuts&rdquo; in
computational resources. Consider, e.g., the DNA model of computation
that was claimed (Adleman 1994; Lipton 1995) to solve
<strong>NP</strong>-complete problems in polynomial time. A closer
inspection shows that the cost of the computation in this model is
still exponential since the number of molecules in the physical system
grows exponentially with the size of the problem. Or take an allegedly
instantaneous solution to another <strong>NP</strong>-complete problem
using a construction of rods and balls (Vergis, Steiglitz, &amp;
Dickinson 1986) that unfortunately ignores the accumulating
time-delays in the rigid rods that result in an exponential overall
slowdown. It appears that these and other similar models cannot serve
as counter-examples to the physical Church-Turing thesis (as far as
complexity is concerned) since they all require some exponential
physical resource. Note, however, that all these models are described
using classical physics, hence the unavoidable question: Can the shift
to quantum physics allow us to find computational short-cuts? The
quest for the quantum computer began with the possibility of giving a
positive answer to this question.</p>

<h3 id="Mile">1.3 Milestones</h3>

<p>
As early as 1969 Steven Wiesner suggested quantum information
processing as a possible way to better accomplish cryptologic tasks.
But the first four published papers on quantum information (Wiesner
published his only in 1983), belong to Alexander Holevo (1973), R. P.
Poplavskii (1975), Roman Ingarden (1976), and Yuri Manin (1980).
Better known are contributions made in the early 1980s by Charles H.
Bennett of the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Paul A. Benioff
of Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, David Deutsch of the
University of Oxford, and Richard P. Feynman of the California
Institute of Technology. The idea emerged when scientists were
investigating the fundamental physical limits of computation: If
technology continued to abide by &ldquo;Moore&rsquo;s Law&rdquo; (the
observation made in 1965 by Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, that
the number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits had
doubled every 18 months since the integrated circuit was invented),
then the continually shrinking size of circuitry packed onto silicon
chips would eventually reach a point where individual elements would
be no larger than a few atoms. But since the physical laws that govern
the behaviour and properties of the putative circuit at the atomic
scale are inherently quantum-mechanical in nature, not classical, the
natural question arose whether a new kind of computer could be devised
based on the principles of quantum physics.</p>

<p>
Inspired by Ed Fredkin&rsquo;s ideas on reversible computation (see
Hagar 2016), Feynman was among the first to attempt to provide an
answer to this question by producing an abstract model in 1982 that
showed how a quantum system could be used to do computations. He also
explained how such a machine would be able to act as a simulator for
quantum physics, conjecturing that any classical computer could do the
same task only inefficiently. In 1985, David Deutsch proposed the
first universal quantum Turing machine, which paved the way to the
quantum circuit model (Deutsch 1989) and the development of quantum
algorithms.</p>

<p>
The 1990s saw the discovery of the Deutsch-Josza algorithm (1992) and
of Simon&rsquo;s algorithm (1994). The latter supplied the basis for
Shor&rsquo;s factoring algorithm. Published in 1994, this algorithm
marked a &ldquo;phase transition&rdquo; in the development of quantum
computing and sparked a tremendous interest even outside the physics
community. In that year the first experimental realisation of the
quantum <em>CNOT</em> (controlled-not) gate with trapped ions was
proposed by Cirac &amp; Zoller (1995). In 1995, Peter Shor and Andrew
Steane proposed (independently) the first scheme for quantum
error-correction. In that same year the first realisation of a quantum
logic gate was done in Boulder, Colorado, following Cirac and
Zoller&rsquo;s proposal. In 1996, Lov Grover from Bell Labs invented a
quantum search algorithm which yields a provable (though only
quadratic) &ldquo;speed-up&rdquo; compared to its classical
counterparts. A year later the first model for quantum computation
based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques was proposed.
This technique was realised in 1998 with a 2-qubit register, and was
scaled up to 7 qubits in the Los Alamos National Lab in 2000.</p>

<p>
The adiabatic and cluster-state models of quantum computing were
discovered in 2000 and 2002, respectively (Farhi, Goldstone, Gutmann,
&amp; Sipser 2000; Raussendorf &amp; Briegel 2002) and in 2011 D-Wave
systems announced the creation of &ldquo;D-Wave one,&rdquo; an
adiabatic quantum computer system running on a 128-qubit processor
(Johnson, Amin, Gildert, et al. 2011). The late 2010s saw the
beginning of the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum Computing (NISQ) era
(Preskill 2018), and in 2019 scientists affiliated with Google LLC
announced (Arute, Arya, Babbush, &amp; coauthors 2019) that they had
achieved &ldquo;quantum computational supremacy&rdquo; (Aaronson 2019
[Other Internet Resources])&mdash;the actual existence of a (in this
case, NISQ) quantum computer capable of solving a specific problem for
which no efficient classical algorithm is known&mdash;at least until
2022 when a classical algorithm to outperform Google LLC&rsquo;s
quantum computer was discovered (Pan, Chen, &amp; Zhang 2022), not to
mention subsequent theoretical results demonstrating the inherent
limitations of Google LLC&rsquo;s approach (Aharonov, Gao, Landau,
Liu, &amp; Vazirani 2023). Despite the tremendous growth of the field
since the discovery of Shor&rsquo;s algorithm, the basic questions
remain open even today: (1) theoretically, can quantum algorithms
efficiently solve classically intractable problems? (2) operationally,
can we actually realise a large scale quantum computer to run these
algorithms?</p>

<h2 id="Basi">2. Basics</h2>

<p>
In this section we review the basic paradigm for quantum algorithms,
namely the quantum circuit model, which comprises the basic quantum
unit of information (the qubit) and the basic logical manipulations
thereof (quantum gates). For more detailed introductions see Nielsen
&amp; Chuang (2010) and Mermin (2007).</p>

<h3 id="Qubi">2.1 The Qubit</h3>

<p>
The qubit is the quantum analogue of the bit, the classical
fundamental unit of information. It is a mathematical object with
specific properties that can be realised in an actual physical system
in many different ways. Just as the classical bit has a
<em>state</em>&mdash;either 0 or 1&mdash;a qubit also has a state. Yet
contrary to the classical bit, \(\lvert 0\rangle\) and \(\lvert
1\rangle\) are but two possible states of the qubit, and any linear
combination (superposition) thereof is also possible. <em>In
general</em>, thus, the physical state of a qubit is the superposition
\(\lvert\psi \rangle = \alpha \lvert 0\rangle + \beta \lvert
1\rangle\) (where \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are complex numbers). The
state of a qubit can be described as a vector in a two-dimensional
Hilbert space, a complex vector space (see the entry on
 <a href="../qm/">quantum mechanics</a>).
 The special states \(\lvert 0\rangle\) and \(\lvert 1\rangle\) are
known as the <em>computational basis states</em>, and form an
orthonormal basis for this vector space. According to quantum theory,
when we try to measure the qubit in this basis in order to determine
its state, we get either \(\lvert 0\rangle\) with probability \(\lvert
\alpha\rvert^2\) or \(\lvert 1\rangle\) with probability \(\lvert
\beta\rvert^2\). Since \(\lvert \alpha\rvert^2 + \lvert\beta\rvert^2 =
1\) (i.e., the qubit is a <em>unit</em> vector in the aforementioned
two-dimensional Hilbert space), we may (ignoring the overall phase
factor) effectively write its state as \(\lvert \psi \rangle =\)
cos\((\theta)\lvert 0\rangle + e^{i\phi}\)sin\((\theta)\lvert
1\rangle\), where the numbers \(\theta\) and \(\phi\) define a point
on the unit three-dimensional sphere, as shown in the figure below.
This sphere is typically called <em>the Bloch sphere</em>, and it
provides a useful means to visualise the state space of a single
qubit.</p>

<p>
Since \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are complex and therefore continuous
variables one might think that a single qubit is capable of storing an
infinite amount of information. When measured, however, it yields only
the classical result (0 or 1) with certain probabilities specified by
the quantum state. In other words, the measurement <em>changes</em>
the state of the qubit, &ldquo;collapsing&rdquo; it from a
superposition to one of its terms. In fact one can prove (Holevo 1973)
that the amount of information actually retrievable from a single
qubit (what Timpson (2013, 47ff.) calls its &ldquo;accessible
information&rdquo;) is no more than one bit. If the qubit is
<em>not</em> measured, however, the amount of &ldquo;hidden&rdquo;
information it &ldquo;stores&rdquo; (what Timpson calls its
&ldquo;specification information&rdquo;) is conserved under its
(unitary) dynamical evolution. This feature of quantum mechanics
allows one to manipulate the information stored in unmeasured qubits
with quantum gates (i.e. unitary transformations), and is one of the
sources for the putative power of quantum computers.</p>

<p>
As an illustration, let us suppose we have two qubits at our disposal.
A pair of qubits has four computational basis states: {\(\lvert
00\rangle, \lvert 01\rangle, \lvert 10\rangle, \lvert 11\rangle\)}. If
these were classical bits, they would represent the four physically
possible states of the system. But a pair of qubits can also exist in
what can be described as a superposition of these four basis states,
each of which has its own complex coefficient (whose mod square, being
interpreted as a probability, is normalised). As long as the quantum
system evolves unitarily and is unmeasured, it can be imagined to
&ldquo;store&rdquo; that many bits of (specification) information. The
difficult task, however, is to use this information efficiently in
light of the bound on the state&rsquo;s accessible information.</p>

<h3 id="QuanGate">2.2 Quantum Gates</h3>

<p>
Classical computational gates are Boolean logic gates that manipulate
information stored in bits. In quantum computing such gates are
represented by matrices, and can be visualised as rotations over the
Bloch sphere. This visualisation represents the fact that quantum
gates are unitary operators, i.e., they preserve the norm of the
quantum state (i.e., \(U^{\dagger}U=I\), where \(U\) is a linear
operator representing a quantum gate and \(U^{\dagger}\) is its
adjoint). In classical computing some gates are
&ldquo;universal&rdquo;. For instance, all of the possible logical
connections between two inputs A and B can be realised using some
string of <em>NAND</em> gates (which each evaluate the function
&ldquo;not both A and B&rdquo;). Another universal gate is
<em>NOR</em>. In the context of quantum computing it was shown
(DiVincenzo 1995) that two-qubit gates (i.e. that transform two
qubits) are sufficient to realise any quantum circuit, in the sense
that a circuit composed exclusively from (a small set of) one- and
two-qubit gates can approximate to arbitrary accuracy any unitary
transformation of \(n\) qubits. Barenco <em>et. al.</em> (1995) showed
in particular that any multiple-qubit logic gate may be composed in
this sense from a combination of single-qubit gates and the two-qubit
controlled-not (<em>CNOT</em>) gate, which either flips or preserves
its &ldquo;target&rdquo; input bit depending on the state of its
&ldquo;control&rdquo; input bit (specifically: in a <em>CNOT</em> gate
the output state of the target qubit is the result of an operation
analogous to the classical exclusive-OR (<em>XOR</em>) gate on the
inputs). One general feature of quantum gates that distinguishes them
from classical gates is that they are always reversible: the inverse
of a unitary matrix is also a unitary matrix, and thus a quantum gate
can always be inverted by another quantum gate.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">The CNOT Gate</span></p>
</div>

<p>
Unitary gates manipulate information stored in the &ldquo;quantum
register&rdquo;&mdash;a quantum system&mdash;and in this sense
ordinary (unitary) quantum evolution can be regarded as a computation.
In order to read the result of this computation, however, the quantum
register must be measured. Measurement is represented as a non-unitary
gate that &ldquo;collapses&rdquo; the quantum superposition in the
register onto one of its terms with a probability corresponding to
that term&rsquo;s complex coefficient. Usually this is described with
respect to the computational basis, but in principle a measurement
could be carried out in any of the infinitely many possible
orthonormal bases with respect to which a given state \(| \psi
\rangle\) can be expressed as a linear combination of basis states. It
so happens that some such measurements are more difficult to implement
than others.</p>

<h3 id="QuanCirc">2.3 Quantum Circuits</h3>

<p>
Quantum circuits are similar to classical computer circuits in that
they consist of logical <em>wires</em> and <em>gates</em>. The wires
are used to carry the information, while the gates manipulate it (note
that the wires are abstract and do not necessarily correspond to
physical wires; they may correspond to a physical particle, e.g. a
photon, moving from one location to another in space, or even to
time-evolution). Conventionally, the input of the quantum circuit is
assumed to be a number of qubits each initialised to a computational
basis state (typically \(\lvert 0\rangle\)). The output state of the
circuit is then measured in some orthonormal basis (usually the
computational basis).</p>

<p>
The first quantum algorithms (i.e., Deutsch-Jozsa, Simon, Shor and
Grover) were constructed in this paradigm. Additional paradigms for
quantum computing exist today that differ from the circuit model in
many interesting ways. So far, however, they all have been
demonstrated to be computationally equivalent to the circuit model
(see below), in the sense that any computational problem that can be
solved by the circuit model can be solved by these new models with
only a polynomial overhead in computational resources. We note the
parallel here with the various classical computational models, for
which it is also the case that any &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; such model
can be efficiently simulated by any other (for discussion, see Cuffaro
2018b, 274).</p>

<h2 id="QuanAlgo">3 Quantum Algorithms</h2>

<p>
Algorithm design is a highly complicated task, and in quantum
computing, delicately leveraging the features of quantum mechanics in
order to make an algorithm more efficient makes the task even more
complicated. But before discussing this aspect of quantum algorithm
design, let us first convince ourselves that quantum computers can
actually simulate classical computation. In some sense this is
obvious, given the belief in the universal character of quantum
mechanics, and the observation that any quantum computation that is
diagonal in the computational basis, i.e., that involves no
interference between the qubits, is effectively classical. Yet the
demonstration that quantum circuits can be used to simulate classical
circuits is not straightforward (recall that the former are always
reversible while the latter use gates which are in general
irreversible). Indeed, quantum circuits cannot be used
<em>directly</em> to simulate classical computation, but the latter
can still be simulated on a quantum computer using an intermediate
gate, namely the <em>Toffoli</em> gate. This universal classical gate
has three input bits and three output bits. Two of the input bits are
control bits, unaffected by the action of the gate. The third input
bit is a target bit that is flipped if both control bits are set to 1,
and otherwise is left alone. This gate is reversible (its inverse is
itself), but by stringing a number of such gates together one can
simulate any classical circuit. Consequently, using the quantum
version of the <em>Toffoli</em> gate (which by definition permutes the
computational basis states similarly to the classical <em>Toffoli</em>
gate) one can simulate, although rather tediously, irreversible
classical logic gates with quantum reversible ones. Quantum computers
are thus capable of performing any computation which a classical
deterministic computer can do.</p>

<p>
What about probabilistic computation? Not surprisingly, a quantum
computer can also simulate this type of computation by using another
famous quantum gate, namely the Hadamard gate, a single-qubit gate
that takes the input state \(\lvert 0\rangle\) to \(\frac{\lvert
0\rangle + \lvert 1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}\) and the input state \(\lvert
1\rangle\) to \(\frac{\lvert 0\rangle - \lvert 1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}\).
Measuring either of these output states yields \(\lvert 0\rangle\) or
\(\lvert 1\rangle\) with 50/50 probability, which can be used to
simulate a fair coin toss.</p>

<p>
Obviously, if quantum algorithms could be used only to simulate
classical algorithms the interest in them would be far more limited
than it currently is. But while there may always be some computational
problems that resist quantum speed-up (see Myers 1997 and Linden &amp;
Popescu 1998 [Other Internet Resources]), there is a general
confidence in the community that quantum algorithms may not only
simulate classical ones, but that they will actually
<em>outperform</em> the latter in some cases, with debatable (Cuffaro
2018b; Hagar 2007) implications for our abstract notions of
tractability and intractability.</p>

<h3 id="QuanCircBaseAlgo">3.1 Quantum Circuit-Based Algorithms</h3>

<h4 id="Orac">3.1.1 Oracles</h4>

<p>
The first quantum algorithms were designed to solve problems which
essentially involve the use of an &ldquo;oracle&rdquo;, so let us
begin by explaining this term. An oracle is a conceptual device that
has proven useful in the complexity-theoretic analysis of
computational problems, which one can think of as a kind of imaginary
magic black box (Arora &amp; Barak 2009, 72&ndash;73; Aaronson 2013a,
29ff.) to which, like the famous oracle at Delphi, one poses (yes or
no) questions. Unlike that ancient oracle, the oracles considered in
computer science always return an answer in a <em>single</em> time
step. For example, we can imagine an oracle to determine whether a
given Boolean formula is satisfiable or not: Given as input the
description of a particular propositional formula, the oracle
outputs&mdash;in a single time step&mdash;a single bit indicating
whether or not there is a truth-value assignment satisfying that
formula. Obviously such a machine does not really
exist&mdash;<strong>SAT</strong> (short for satisfiability) is an
NP-complete problem&mdash;but that is not the point. The point of
using such imaginary devices is to abstract away from certain
&ldquo;implementational details&rdquo; which are for whatever reason
deemed unimportant for answering a given complexity-theoretic
question. For example, Simon&rsquo;s problem (Simon 1994) is that of
determining the period of a given function \(f\) that is periodic
under bit-wise modulo-2 addition. Relative to Simon&rsquo;s problem,
we judge the internal complexity of \(f\) to be unimportant, and so
abstract away from it by imagining that we have an oracle to evaluate
it in a single step. As useful as these conceptual devices are,
however, their usefulness has limitations. To take one example, there
are oracles relative to which <strong>P</strong> =
<strong>NP</strong>, as well as oracles relative to which
<strong>P</strong> \(\not =\) <strong>NP</strong>. This (and many
other) questions are not clarified by oracles (see Fortnow 1994).</p>

<h4 id="DeutAlgo">3.1.2 Deutsch&rsquo;s Algorithm</h4>

<p>
Deutsch (1989) asks the following question: Suppose we have a function
\(f\) which can be either constant&mdash;i.e. such that it produces
the same output value for each of its possible inputs, or
balanced&mdash;i.e. such that the output of one half of its possible
inputs is the opposite of the output of the other half. The particular
example considered is a function \(f : \{0,1\} \rightarrow \{0,1\}\),
which is constant if \(f\)(0) \(= f\)(1) and balanced if \(f\)(0)
\(\ne f\)(1). Classically it would take <em>two</em> evaluations of
the function to tell whether it is one or the other.
Quantum-mechanically, we can answer this question in <em>one</em>
evaluation.</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break">

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">A Schematic Representation of Deutsch&rsquo;s
Algorithm</span></p>
</div>

<p>
After initially preparing (Mermin 2007, ch. 2) the first and second
qubits of the computer in the state \(\lvert 0\rangle\lvert
0\rangle\), one then &ldquo;flips&rdquo; both qubits (see the Figure
above) using &ldquo;NOT&rdquo; gates (i.e. Pauli <em>X</em>
transformations) to \(\lvert 1 \rangle\), and then subjects each qubit
to a Hadamard gate. One then sends the two qubits through an oracle or
&lsquo;black box&rsquo; which one imagines as a unitary gate,
\(\mathbf{U}_f\), representative of the function whose character (of
being either constant or balanced) we wish to determine, where we
define \(\mathbf{U}_f\) so that it takes inputs like \(\lvert
x,y\rangle\) to \(\lvert x, y\oplus f (x)\rangle\), such that
\(\oplus\) is addition modulo two (i.e. exclusive-or). The first qubit
is then fed into a further Hadamard gate, and the final output of the
algorithm (prior to measurement) is the state:</p> 
\[\frac{1}{2}| 1 \rangle(| f(0) \rangle - | \hat{f}(0) \rangle)\]

<p>
whenever \(f\) is constant, and the state:</p> 
\[\frac{1}{2}| 0 \rangle(| f(0) \rangle - |
\hat{f}(0) \rangle)\]

<p>
whenever \(f\) is balanced, where \(\hat{f}(x) \equiv 1 \oplus f(x)\).
Since the computational basis states are orthogonal to one another, a
single measurement of the first qubit suffices to retrieve the answer
to our original question regarding the function&rsquo;s nature. And
since there are two possible constant functions and two possible
balanced functions from \(f : \{0,1\} \rightarrow \{0,1\}\), we can
characterise the algorithm as distinguishing, using only one oracle
call, between two quantum disjunctions without finding out the truth
values of the disjuncts themselves, i.e. without determining
<em>which</em> balanced or <em>which</em> constant function \(f\) is
(Bub 2010).</p>

<p>
A generalisation of Deutsch&rsquo;s problem, called the Deutsch-Jozsa
problem (Deutsch &amp; Jozsa 1992), enlarges the class of functions
under consideration so as to include all of the functions
\(f:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}\), i.e., rather than only considering \(n =
1\). The best deterministic classical algorithm for determining
whether a given such function is constant or balanced requires
\(\frac{2^{n}}{2}+1\) queries to an oracle. In a quantum computer,
however, we can answer the question using <em>one</em> oracle call. As
with Deutsch&rsquo;s algorithm, an analysis shows that the reason why
a quantum computer only requires one call to the oracle to evaluate
the global property of the function in question, is that the output
state of the computer is a superposition of balanced and constant
states such that the balanced states all lie in a subspace of the
system&rsquo;s Hilbert space orthogonal to that of the constant states
and can therefore be distinguished from the latter in a single
measurement (Bub 2006a).</p>

<h4 id="SimoAlgo">3.1.3 Simon&rsquo;s Algorithm</h4>

<p>
Suppose we have a Boolean function \(f\) on \(n\) bits that is 2-to-1,
i.e. that takes \(n\) bits to \(n-1\) bits in such a way that for
every \(n\)-bit integer \(x_1\) there is an \(n\)-bit integer \(x_2\)
for which \(f (x_{1}) = f (x_{2})\). The function is moreover periodic
in the sense that \(f(x_1)\) = \(f(x_2)\) if and only if \(x_1 = x_2
\oplus a\), where \(\oplus\) designates bit-wise modulo 2 addition and
\(a\) is an \(n\)-bit nonzero number called the <em>period</em> of
\(f\). Simon&rsquo;s problem is the problem to find \(a\) given \(f\).
Relative to an oracle \(U_f\) that evaluates \(f\) in a single step,
Simon&rsquo;s quantum algorithm (Simon 1994) finds the period of \(f\)
in a number of oracle calls that grows only linearly with the length
of \(n\), while the best known classical algorithm requires an
exponentially greater number of oracle calls. Simon&rsquo;s algorithm
reduces to Deutsch&rsquo;s algorithm when \(n=2\), and can be regarded
as an extension of the latter, in the sense that in both cases a
global property of a function is evaluated in no more than a
(sub-)polynomial number of oracle invocations, owing to the fact that
the output state of the computer just before the final measurement is
decomposed into orthogonal subspaces, only one of which contains the
problem&rsquo;s solution. Note that one important difference between
Deutsch&rsquo;s and Simon&rsquo;s algorithms is that the former yields
a solution with certainty, whereas the latter only yields a solution
with probability very close to 1. For more on the logical analysis of
these first quantum circuit-based algorithms see Bub (2006a) and Bub
(2010).</p>

<h4 id="ShorAlgo">3.1.4 Shor&rsquo;s Algorithm</h4>

<p>
The algorithms just described, although demonstrating the potential
superiority of quantum over classical computation, nevertheless deal
with apparently unimportant computational problems. Moreover the
speed-ups in each of them are only relative to their respective
oracles. It is therefore doubtful whether research into quantum
computing would have attracted so much attention in the 1990s had Shor
not realised that Simon&rsquo;s algorithm could be harnessed to solve
a much more interesting and crucial problem, namely
<em>factoring</em>, which lies at the heart of widely-used
cryptographic protocols such as RSA (Rivest, Shamir, &amp; Adleman
1978). Shor&rsquo;s algorithm turned quantum computing into one of the
most exciting research domains in quantum mechanics.</p>

<p>
Shor&rsquo;s algorithm exploits the ingenious number theoretic
argument that two prime factors \(p,q\) of a positive integer \(N=pq\)
can be found by determining the period, \(r\), of a function \(f(x) =
y^x \textrm{mod} N,\) for any \(y &lt; N\) which has no common factors
with \(N\) other than 1 (Nielsen &amp; Chuang 2010, app. 4). The
period of \(f(x)\) depends on \(y\) and \(N\). If one knows it, one
can factor \(N\) if \(r\) is even and if \(y^{\,\frac{r}{2}} \neq -1\)
mod \(N\). This will be jointly the case with probability greater than
\(\frac{1}{2}\) for any \(y\) chosen randomly (otherwise one chooses
another value of \(y\) and tries again). The factors of \(N\) are the
greatest common divisors of \(y^{\,\frac{r}{2}} \pm 1\) and \(N\),
which can be found in polynomial time using the well known Euclidean
algorithm. In other words, Shor&rsquo;s remarkable result rests on the
discovery that the problem of <em>factoring</em> reduces to the
problem of finding the period of a certain periodic function. That
this problem can be solved efficiently by a quantum computer is hinted
at by Simon&rsquo;s algorithm, which considers the more restricted
case of functions periodic under bit-wise modulo-2 addition as opposed
to the periodic functions under ordinary addition considered here.</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding that <em>factoring</em> is believed to be only in
<strong>NP</strong> and not in <strong>NP</strong>-complete (see
Aaronson 2013a, 64&ndash;66), Shor&rsquo;s result is arguably the most
dramatic example of quantum speed-up known. To verify whether \(n\) is
prime takes a number of steps which is polynomial in \(\log_{2}n\)
(the binary encoding of a natural number \(n\) requires \(\log_{2}n\)
resources). But nobody knows how to classically factor numbers into
primes in polynomial time, and the best classical algorithms we have
for this problem are sub-exponential. A number of widely-used modern
cryptographic protocols are based on these facts (Giblin 1993), and
the discovery that quantum computers can solve <em>factoring</em> in
polynomial time has therefore had a dramatic effect. The
implementation of the algorithm on a scalable architecture would
consequently have economic, as well as scientific consequences
(All&eacute;aume et al. 2014).</p>

<h4 id="GrovAlgo">3.1.5 Grover&rsquo;s Algorithm</h4>

<p>
In a brilliant undercover operation, Agent 13 has managed to secure
two crucial bits of information concerning the whereabouts of the
arch-villain Siegfried: the phone number of the secret hideout from
which he intends to begin carrying out KAOS&rsquo;s plans for world
domination, and the fact that the number is a listed one (apparently
an oversight on Siegfried&rsquo;s part). Unfortunately you and your
colleagues at CONTROL have no other information besides this. Can you
find Siegfried&rsquo;s hideout using only this number and a phone
directory? In theoretical computer science this task is known as an
unstructured search. In the worst case, if there are \(n\) entries in
the directory, the computational resources required to find the entry
will be linear in \(n\). Grover (1996) showed how this task could be
done with a quantum algorithm using computational resources on the
order of only \(\sqrt{n}\). Agreed, this speed-up is more modest than
Shor&rsquo;s since unstructured search belongs to the class
\(\mathbf{P}\), but contrary to Shor&rsquo;s case, where the classical
complexity of factoring is still unknown, here the superiority of the
quantum algorithm, however modest, is definitely provable. That this
quadratic speed-up is also the <em>optimal</em> quantum speed-up
possible for this problem was proved by Bennett, Bernstein, Brassard,
&amp; Vazirani (1997).</p>

<p>
Although the purpose of Grover&rsquo;s algorithm is usually described
as &ldquo;searching a database&rdquo;, it may be more accurate to
describe it as &ldquo;inverting a function&rdquo;. Roughly speaking,
if we have a function \(y=f(x)\) that can be evaluated on a quantum
computer, Grover&rsquo;s algorithm allows us to calculate \(x\) given
\(y\). Inverting a function is related to searching a database because
we could come up with a function that produces a particular value of
\(y\) if \(x\) matches a desired entry in a database, and another
value of \(y\) for other values of \(x\). The applications of
Grover&rsquo;s algorithm are far-reaching (even more so than foiling
Siegfried&rsquo;s plans for world domination). For example, it can be
used to determine efficiently the number of solutions to an \(N\)-item
search problem, hence to perform exhaustive searches on a class of
solutions to an <strong>NP</strong>-complete problem and substantially
reduce the computational resources required for solving it.</p>

<h3 id="AdiaAlgo">3.2 Adiabatic Algorithms</h3>

<p>
Many decades have passed since the discovery of the first quantum
algorithm, but so far little progress has been made with respect to
the &ldquo;Holy Grail&rdquo; of solving an
<strong>NP</strong>-complete problem with a quantum circuit. In 2000 a
group of physicists from MIT and Northeastern University (Farhi et al.
2000 [Other Internet Resources]) proposed a novel paradigm for quantum
computing that differs from the circuit model in several interesting
ways. Their goal was to try to decide with this algorithm instances of
one of the most famous <strong>NP</strong>-complete problems:
<em>satisfiability</em>. According to the adiabatic theorem (see,
e.g., Messiah 1961) and given certain specific conditions, a quantum
system remains in its lowest energy state, known as the ground state,
along an adiabatic transformation in which the system is deformed
slowly and smoothly from an initial Hamiltonian to a final Hamiltonian
(as an illustration, think of moving a sleeping baby in a cradle from
the living room to the bedroom. If the transition is done slowly and
smoothly enough, and if the baby is a sound sleeper, then it will
remain asleep during the whole transition). The most important
condition in this theorem is the energy gap between the ground state
and the next excited state (in our analogy, this gap reflects how
sound asleep the baby is). Being inversely proportional to the
evolution time \(T\), this gap controls the latter. If this gap exists
during the entire evolution (i.e., there is no level crossing between
the energy states of the system), the theorem dictates that in the
adiabatic limit (when \(T\rightarrow \infty)\) the system will remain
in its ground state. In practice, of course, \(T\) is always finite,
but the longer it is, the less likely it is that the system will
deviate from its ground state during the time evolution.</p>

<p>
The crux of the quantum adiabatic algorithm which rests on this
theorem lies in the possibility of encoding a specific instance of a
given decision problem in a certain Hamiltonian (this can be done by
capitalising on the well-known fact that any decision problem can be
derived from an optimisation problem by incorporating into it a
numerical bound as an additional parameter). One then starts the
system in a ground state of another Hamiltonian which is easy to
construct, and slowly evolves the system in time, deforming it towards
the desired Hamiltonian. According to the quantum adiabatic theorem
and given the gap condition, the result of such a physical process is
another energy ground state that encodes the solution to the desired
decision problem. The adiabatic algorithm is thus a rather &lsquo;laid
back&rsquo; algorithm: one needs only to start the system in its
ground state, deform it adiabatically, and measure its final ground
state in order to retrieve the desired result. But whether or not this
algorithm yields the desired speed-up depends crucially on the
behaviour of the energy gap as the number of degrees of freedom in the
system increases. If this gap decreases exponentially with the size of
the input, then the evolution time of the algorithm will increase
exponentially; if the gap decreases polynomially, the decision problem
so encoded could be solved efficiently. Physicists have been studying
spectral gaps for almost a century, but they have only relatively
recently begun to do so with computing in mind. It is now known that
there exists no algorithm to determine, given the Hamiltonian of an
arbitrary quantum many-body system, whether it is gapped or gapless
(Cubitt, Perez-Garcia, &amp; Wolf 2015). In practice, gap
amplification techniques are employed in adiabatic quantum computers
to ensure the existence of a gap throughout a computation (Albash
&amp; Lidar 2018, sec. F).</p>

<p>
The quantum adiabatic algorithm holds much promise (Farhi et al.
2001). It has been shown (Aharonov et al. 2008) to be polynomially
equivalent to the circuit model (that is, each model can simulate the
other with only polynomial overhead in the number of qubits and
computational steps), but the caveat that is sometimes left
unmentioned is that its application to an intractable computational
problem may sometimes require solving another, as intractable a task
(this general worry was first raised by a philosopher; see Pitowsky
1990). Indeed, Reichardt (2004) has shown that there are simple
problems for which the algorithm will get stuck in a local minimum, in
which there are exponentially many eigenvalues all exponentially close
to the ground state energy, so applying the adiabatic theorem, even
for these simple problems, will take exponential time, and we are back
to square one. For a recent survey of the state of the art, see Albash
&amp; Lidar (2018).</p>

<h3 id="MeasBaseAlgo">3.3 Measurement-Based Algorithms</h3>

<p>
Measurement-based algorithms differ from circuit algorithms in that
instead of employing unitary evolution as the basic mechanism for the
manipulation of information, these algorithms make essential use of
measurements in the course of a computation and not only at the
readout stage. They fall into two categories. The first is
teleportation quantum computing, based on an idea of Gottesman &amp;
Chuang (1999), and developed into a computational model by Nielsen
(2003) and Leung (2004). The second is the &ldquo;one way quantum
computer&rdquo;, known also as the &ldquo;cluster state&rdquo; model
(Raussendorf &amp; Briegel 2002). The interesting feature of these
models, which are polynomially equivalent to the circuit model
(Raussendorf, Browne, &amp; Briegel 2003), is that they can
efficiently simulate unitary quantum dynamics using non-unitary
measurements. This is accomplished (see Duwell 2021, 5.2) via
measurements on a pool of highly entangled quantum systems such that
the orthonormal basis in which each measurement is performed is
calculated, via a classical computer, using the results of earlier
measurements.</p>

<p>
Measurement-based models are interesting from a foundational
perspective for a number of reasons. To begin with, in these models
there is a clear separation between the classical (i.e., the
calculation of the next measurement-basis) and quantum (i.e.,
measurements on the entangled qubits) parts of a computation, which
may make it easier to pinpoint the quantum resources that are
responsible for speed-up. Further, they may offer insight into the
role of
 <a href="../qt-entangle/">entanglement</a>
 in quantum computing. They may also have interesting
engineering-related consequences, suggesting a different kind of
computer architecture which is more fault tolerant (Brown &amp;
Roberts 2020; Nielsen &amp; Dawson 2005).</p>

<h3 id="TopoQuanFielTheoTQFTAlgo">3.4 Topological-Quantum-Field-Theory (TQFT) Algorithms</h3>

<p>
Another model for quantum computing which has attracted a lot of
attention, especially from Microsoft inc. (Freedman 1998), is the
Topological Quantum Field Theory model (Lahtinen &amp; Pachos 2017).
In contrast to the easily visualisable circuit model, this model
resides in the most abstract reaches of theoretical physics. The
exotic physical systems TQFT describes are topological states of
matter. That the formalism of TQFT can be applied to computational
problems was shown by Witten (1989) and the idea was later developed
by others. One of the principal merits of the model, which is
polynomially equivalent to the circuit model (Aharonov, Jones, &amp;
Landau 2009; Freedman, Kitaev, &amp; Wang 2002), lies in its high
tolerance to the errors which are inevitably introduced in the
implementation of a large scale quantum computer (see below). Topology
is especially helpful here because many global topological properties
are, by definition, invariant under deformation, and given that most
errors are local, information encoded in topological properties is
robust against them.</p>

<h2 id="Real">4 Realisations</h2>

<p>
The quantum computer might be the theoretician&rsquo;s dream, but as
far as experimentalists are concerned, its full realisation, which
involves resolving the still open question of how to combine the
elements needed to build a quantum computer into scalable systems (see
Van Meter &amp; Horsman 2013), is a nightmare. Shor&rsquo;s algorithm
may break RSA encryption, but it will remain an anecdote if the
largest number that it can factor is 21 (Mart&iacute;n-L&oacute;pez et
al. 2012; Skosana &amp; Tame 2021). In the circuit-based model the
problem is to achieve a scalable quantum system that at the same time
will allow one to (1) robustly represent quantum information with (2)
a time to decoherence significantly longer than the length of the
computation, (3) implement a universal family of unitary
transformations, (4) prepare a fiducial initial state, and (5) measure
the output result (these are DiVincenzo (2000)&rsquo;s five criteria).
Alternative paradigms may trade some of these requirements with
others, but the gist will remain the same, i.e., one would have to
achieve control of one&rsquo;s quantum system in such a way that the
system will remain &ldquo;quantum&rdquo; albeit macroscopic or at
least mesoscopic in its dimensions.</p>

<p>
In order to deal with these challenges, several ingenious solutions
have been devised, including quantum error correction codes and fault
tolerant computation (Aharonov &amp; Ben-Or 1997; de Beaudrap &amp;
Horsman 2020; Horsman, Fowler, Devitt, &amp; Van Meter 2012;
Raussendorf, Harrington, &amp; Goyal 2008; Shor 1995; Shor &amp;
DiVincenzo 1996; Steane 1996) which can dramatically reduce the spread
of errors during a &lsquo;noisy&rsquo; quantum computation. An
important criticism of these active error correction schemes, however,
is that they are devised for a very unrealistic noise model which
treats the computer as quantum and the environment as classical
(Alicki, Lidar, &amp; Zinardi 2006). Once a more realistic noise model
is allowed, the feasibility of large scale, fault tolerant and
computationally superior quantum computers is less clear (Hagar 2009;
Tabakin 2017).</p>

<p>
In the near term, a promising avenue for realising a quantum advantage
in a limited number of problem domains is the Noisy Intermediate-Scale
Quantum (NISQ) paradigm (Lau, Lim, Shrotriya, &amp; Kwek 2022;
Preskill 2018). The NISQ paradigm does not employ any error correction
mechanisms (postponing the problem to implement scalable versions of
these to the future) but rather focuses on building computational
components, and on tackling computational problems, that are
inherently more resilient to noise. These include, for example,
certain classes of optimisation problems, quantum semidefinite
programming, and digital quantum simulation (Tacchino, Chiesa,
Carretta, &amp; Gerace 2020). A caveat here is that as the resiliency
to noise of a circuit increases, the more classically it behaves.</p>

<p>
As just mentioned, one of the envisioned applications of NISQ
computing is for digital quantum simulation (i.e. simulation using a
gate-based programmable quantum computer). There is an older tradition
of <em>analog</em> quantum simulation, however, wherein one utilises a
quantum system whose dynamics resemble the dynamics of a particular
target system of interest. Although it is believed that digital
quantum simulation will eventually supersede it, the field of analog
quantum simulation has progressed substantially in the years since it
was first proposed, and analog quantum simulators have already been
used to study quantum dynamics in regimes thought to be beyond the
reach of classical simulators (see, e.g., Bernien et al. 2017; for
further discussion of the philosophical issues involved, see
Hangleiter, Carolan, &amp; Th&eacute;bault 2022).</p>

<h2 id="PhilQues">5 Philosophical Questions</h2>

<p>
In this section we review some of the important philosophical issues
related to quantum computing that have been discussed in the
philosophical and physical literature. For more detailed surveys of
some of these issues that are still accessible to non-specialists, see
Cuffaro (2022) and Duwell (2021).</p>

<h3 id="WhatQuanQuanComp">5.1 What is <em>Quantum</em> in Quantum Computing?</h3>

<p>
Putting aside the problem of practically realising and implementing a
large scale quantum computer, a crucial theoretical question remains
open: What physical resources&mdash;which of the essential features of
quantum mechanics&mdash;are responsible for the putative power of
quantum computers to outperform classical computers? A number of
candidates have been put forward. Fortnow (2003) posits interference
as the key, though it has been suggested that this is not truly a
quantum phenomenon (Spekkens 2007). Jozsa (1997) and many others point
to entanglement, although there are purported counter-examples to this
thesis (see, e.g., Linden &amp; Popescu 1998 [Other Internet
Resources], Biham, Brassard, Kenigsberg, &amp; Mor 2004, and for a
philosophical discussion of their significance see Cuffaro 2017).
Howard, Wallman, Veitch, &amp; Emerson (2014) appeal to quantum
contextuality. For Bub (2010), the answer lies in the logical
structure of quantum mechanics (cf. Dalla Chiara, Giuntini, Leporini,
&amp; Sergioli 2018), while Duwell (2018) argues for quantum
parallelism. And for Deutsch (1997) and others it is &ldquo;parallel
worlds&rdquo; which are the resource.</p>

<p>
Speculative as it may seem, the question &ldquo;what is
<em>quantum</em> in quantum computing?&rdquo; has significant
practical consequences. It is almost certain that one of the reasons
for the paucity of quantum algorithms that have actually been
discovered is the lack of a full understanding of what makes a quantum
computer quantum. Quantum computing skeptics (Levin 2003) happily
capitalise on this: If no one knows <em>why</em> quantum computers are
superior to classical ones, how can we be sure that they <em>are</em>,
indeed, superior?</p>

<h4 id="DebaOverParaManyWorl">5.1.1 The Debate over Parallelism and Many Worlds</h4>

<p>
The answer that has tended to dominate the popular literature on
quantum computing is motivated by evolutions such as:</p> 
\[\tag{1}
\Sigma_{x} \lvert x\rangle \lvert 0\rangle \rightarrow \Sigma_{x}
\lvert x\rangle \lvert f(x)\rangle,\]

<p>
which were common to many early quantum algorithms. Note the
appearance that \(f\) is evaluated for each of its possible inputs
simultaneously. The idea that we should take this at face
value&mdash;that quantum computers <em>actually do</em> compute a
function for many different input values simultaneously&mdash;is what
Duwell (2018, 2021) calls the <em>Quantum Parallelism Thesis</em>
(QPT). For Deutsch, who accepts it as true, the only reasonable
explanation for the QPT is that the
 <a href="../qm-manyworlds/">many worlds interpretation</a>
 (MWI) of quantum mechanics is also true. For Deutsch, a quantum
computer in superposition, like any other quantum system, exists in
some sense in many classical universes simultaneously. These provide
the physical arena within which the computer effects its parallel
computations. This conclusion is also defended by Hewitt-Horsman
(2009) and by Wallace (2012). Wallace notes, however, that the
QPT&mdash;and hence the explanatory need for many worlds&mdash;may not
be true of all or even most quantum algorithms.</p>

<p>
For Pitowsky (2002) and Steane (2003), the explanation for quantum
speedup is not to be found in quantum parallelism. Pitowsky (2002)
asks us to consider a given solution, which has been found using a
quantum circuit-based algorithm, to a problem like
<em>satisfiability</em>. The quantum algorithm may appear to solve
this problem by testing exponentially many assignments &ldquo;at
once&rdquo; as suggested by (1), yet this quantum
&lsquo;miracle&rsquo; helps us very little since, as previously
mentioned, any measurement performed on the output state collapses it,
and if there is one possible truth assignment that solves this
decision problem, the probability of retrieving it is no greater than
it would be for a classical probabilistic Turing machine which guesses
the solution and then checks it. Pitowsky&rsquo;s conclusion is that
achieving quantum speedup requires us to construct
&lsquo;clever&rsquo; superpositions that increase the probability of
successfully retrieving the result far more than that of a pure guess
(see also Aaronson 2022 [Other Internet Resources]). Steane (2003),
among other things, argues that if we compare the information actually
produced by quantum and classical algorithms, then we should conclude
that quantum algorithms perform not more but <em>fewer</em>, cleverer,
computations than classical algorithms (see, also, Section
 <a href="#ElusNatuSpeeUp">5.1.2</a>
 below). Additionally Steane argues that the motivation for the QPT is
at least partly due to misleading aspects of the standard quantum
formalism.</p>

<p>
Another critic of the MWI approach is Duwell, who (contra Pitowsky and
Steane) accepts the QPT (Duwell 2018), but nevertheless denies (contra
Deutsch) that it uniquely supports the MWI (Duwell 2007). Considering
the phase relations between the terms in a superposition such as (1)
is crucially important when evaluating a quantum algorithm&rsquo;s
computational efficiency. Phase relations, however, are global
properties of a state. Thus a quantum computation, Duwell argues, does
not consist <em>solely</em> of local parallel computations. But in
this case, the QPT does not uniquely support the MWI over other
explanations.</p>

<p>
Defending the MWI, Hewitt-Horsman (2009) argues (contra Steane) that
to state that quantum computers do not actually generate each of the
evaluation instances represented in (1) is false according to the
view: on the MWI such information could be extracted in principle
given sufficiently advanced technology. Further, Hewitt-Horsman
emphasises that the MWI is not motivated simply by a suggestive
mathematical representation. Worlds on the MWI are defined according
to their explanatory usefulness, manifested in particular by their
stability and independence over the time scales relevant to the
computation. Wallace (2012) argues similarly.</p>

<p>
Aaronson (2013b) and Cuffaro (2012, 2022) point out that there is a
prima facie tension between the Many Worlds Explanation (MWX) of
Quantum Computing and the MWI. The latter typically employs
 <a href="../qm-decoherence/">decoherence</a>
 as a criterion for distinguishing macroscopic worlds from one
another. Quantum circuit model algorithms, however, utilise coherent
superpositions. To distinguish computational worlds from one another,
therefore, one needs to somehow modify the decoherence criterion, but
Cuffaro questions whether this can be successfully motivated
independently of a prior commitment to the MWI. Further, Cuffaro
argues that the MWX is for all practical purposes incompatible with
 <a href="#MeasBaseAlgo">measurement based computation</a>,
 for even granting the legitimacy of a modified world identification
criterion, there is no natural way in this model to identify worlds
that are stable and independent in the way required.</p>

<h4 id="ElusNatuSpeeUp">5.1.2 The Elusive Nature of Speed-Up</h4>

<p>
Even if we could rule out the MWX, identifying the physical
resource(s) responsible for quantum speed-up would remain a difficult
problem. Among other things the question raises important issues about
how to measure the complexity of a given quantum algorithm, as well as
issues about which quantum operations we can realistically expect to
be able to implement (Geroch 2009, ch. 18; Schmitz 2023). The answers
differ according to the particular model under consideration. In the
adiabatic model one needs only to estimate the energy gap behaviour
and its relation to the input size (encoded in the number of degrees
of freedom of the Hamiltonian of the system). In the measurement-based
model one counts the number of measurements needed to reveal the
solution that is hidden in the input cluster state (since the
preparation of the cluster state is a polynomial process, it does not
add to the complexity of the computation). But in the circuit model
things are not as straightforward. After all, the whole of the quantum
circuit-based computation can be represented as a <em>single</em>
unitary transformation from the input state to the output state.</p>

<p>
This arguably suggests that the source of the power of a quantum
computer, if any, lies not in its dynamics (i.e., the Schr&ouml;dinger
equation) per se, but rather in some feature of the quantum state, or
&ldquo;wave function&rdquo;. Consider also that the Hilbert subspace
&ldquo;visited&rdquo; during a quantum computational process is, at
any moment, a linear space spanned by all of the vectors in the total
Hilbert space which have been created by the computational process up
to that moment. But this Hilbert subspace is thus a subspace spanned
by a polynomial number of vectors and is thus at most a polynomial
subspace of the total Hilbert space. A classical simulation of the
quantum evolution on a Hilbert space with polynomial number of
dimensions (that is, a Hilbert space spanned by a number of basis
vectors which is polynomial in the number of qubits involved in the
computation), however, can be carried out in a polynomial number of
classical computations. Were quantum dynamics solely responsible for
the power of quantum computing, the latter could be mimicked in a
polynomial number of steps with a classical computer (see, e.g. Vidal
2003).</p>

<p>
This is not to say that quantum computation is no more powerful than
classical computation. The key point, of course, is that one does not
end a quantum computation with an arbitrary superposition, but aims
for a very special, &lsquo;clever&rsquo; state&mdash;to use
Pitowsky&rsquo;s term. Quantum computations are not always efficiently
classically simulable because the characterisation of the
computational subspace of certain quantum states is difficult.
Consequently, in the quantum circuit model one should count the number
of computational steps in the computation not by counting the number
of transformations of the state, but by counting the number of one- or
two-qubit local transformations that are required to create the
&lsquo;clever&rsquo; superposition that ensures the desired speed-up.
(Note that Shor&rsquo;s algorithm, for example, involves three major
steps in this context: First, one creates the &lsquo;clever&rsquo;
entangled state with a set of unitary transformations. The result of
the computation&mdash;a global property of a function&mdash;is now
&lsquo;hidden&rsquo; in this state; second, in order to retrieve this
result, one projects it on a subspace of the Hilbert space, and
finally one performs another set of unitary transformations in order
to make the result measurable in the original computational basis.
<em>All</em> these steps count as <em>computational</em> steps as far
as the efficiency of the algorithm is concerned. See also Bub 2006b.)
The trick is to perform these local one- or two-qubit transformations
in polynomial time, and it is likely that it is here where the
physical power of quantum computing may be found.</p>

<h3 id="ExpeMeta">5.2 Experimental Metaphysics?</h3>

<p>
The quantum information revolution has prompted discussion and debate
(in which both physicists and philosophers have figured centrally)
over what the rising new science can tell us about the foundations of
quantum mechanics (see, e.g., Bub 2016; Bub &amp; Pitowsky 2010;
Chiribella &amp; Spekkens 2016; Cuffaro 2020; Dunlap 2022; Duwell
2020; Felline 2016; Henderson 2020; Koberinski &amp; M&uuml;ller 2018;
Janas, Cuffaro, &amp; Janssen 2022; Myrvold 2010; Timpson 2013). To be
sure (though see below), no resolution to
 <a href="../qt-issues/#MeasProb">the quantum measurement problem</a>
 would seem to be forthcoming (see Felline 2020; Hagar 2003; Hagar
&amp; Hemmo 2006). But what the rise of the new science has motivated,
some would argue, is a reconsideration of whether that is a problem
worth solving at all. On &ldquo;informational approaches&rdquo; to the
interpretation of quantum mechanics such as these (see Cuffaro 2023),
quantum mechanics is seen as elevating something that we already know
effectively constrains the practice of classical physics (Curiel 2020
[Other Internet Resources]) to the level of a postulate, namely, that
interpreting the outcome of a measurement interaction as providing us
with information about a given system of interest requires the
specification of a schematic representation of an observer, minimally
in terms of a &ldquo;Boolean frame&rdquo; within which one represents
the answers to a set of yes-or-no questions associated with the
system. On such a view, classical physics can be understood as a
special case of this more general conception of a theory in which such
a schematic representation adds no information that is not already
contained, in principle, in a given system&rsquo;s state description.
That quantum mechanics is more general than this is the reason why, it
is argued, it is able to represent correlational phenomena that cannot
be represented efficiently in classical mechanics. And furthermore
this ought to make us reconsider the usefulness for physics of the
quest for a theory underlying quantum mechanics that satisfies our
classical intuitions, such as that a &ldquo;fundamental&rdquo; theory
of physics must solve the measurement problem.</p>

<p>
Not all of the foundational work prompted by the rising science of
quantum computing takes this attitude toward the measurement problem,
and it is the hope of some that recent advances in the realisation of
a large scale quantum computer may actually provide us with an
empirical solution to it. As it turns out,
 <a href="../qm-collapse/">collapse theories</a>&mdash;one
 form of alternatives to quantum theory which aim to solve the
measurement problem&mdash;modify Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s equation and
give different predictions from quantum theory in certain specific
circumstances. These circumstances can be realised, moreover, if
 <a href="../qm-decoherence/">decoherence</a>
 effects can be suppressed (Bassi, Adler, &amp; Ippoliti 2004). Now
one of the most difficult obstacles that await the construction of a
large scale quantum computer is its robustness against decoherence
effects (Unruh 1995). It thus appears that the technological
capabilities required for the realisation of a large scale quantum
computer are potentially related to those upon which the distinction
between &ldquo;true&rdquo; and &ldquo;false&rdquo; collapse (Pearle
1997), i.e., between collapse theories and environmentally induced
decoherence, is contingent. Consequently the physical realisation of a
large-scale quantum computer, if it were of the right architecture,
could potentially shed light on one of the long standing conceptual
problems in the foundations of the theory, and if so this would serve
as yet another example of experimental metaphysics (the term was
coined by Abner Shimony to designate the chain of events that led from
 <a href="../qt-epr/">the EPR argument</a>
 via
 <a href="../bell-theorem/">Bell&rsquo;s theorem</a>
 to Aspect&rsquo;s experiments). Note, however, that as just
mentioned, one would need to consider the computer&rsquo;s
architecture before making any metaphysical conclusions. The computer
architecture is important because while dynamical collapse theories
tend to collapse superpositions involving the positions of macroscopic
quantities of mass, they tend not to collapse large complicated
superpositions of photon polarisation or spin.</p>

<h3 id="QuanCaus">5.3 Quantum Causality</h3>

<p>
Is quantum mechanics compatible with the principle of causality? This
is an old question (Hermann 2017; Schlick 1961, 1962). In the
contemporary literature there is considerable skepticism regarding the
prospects of explaining quantum phenomena causally (Hausman &amp;
Woodward 1999; Woodward 2007), or at any rate <em>locally</em>
causally, especially in the wake of
 <a href="../bell-theorem/">Bell&rsquo;s theorem</a>
 (Myrvold 2016). Inspired by ideas very familiar to computer
scientists, however, a strand in the physical and philosophical
literature on causation has begun to reconsider whether the prospects
for a locally causal explanation of quantum phenomena, at least in the
context of an
 <a href="../causation-mani/">interventionist</a>
 theory of causation, are quite as hopeless as they may initially have
seemed (Adlam 2023; Allen, Barrett, Horsman, Lee, &amp; Spekkens 2017;
Costa &amp; Shrapnel 2016; Lorenz 2022; Shrapnel 2017). This is not to
say that decades of physical and philosophical investigations into the
consequences of Bell&rsquo;s theorem have all been mistaken, of
course. For one thing, the interventionist frameworks utilised in this
new work are operationalist, thus the relevance of this work to
so-called hidden variables theories of quantum mechanics is unclear.
Second, the interventionist frameworks utilised are not classical, and
neither is the kind of causality they explicate. Indeed it is arguably
the key insight emerging from this work that the frameworks previously
utilised for analysing interventionist causation in the quantum
context are inappropriate to that context. In contrast to a classical
interventionist framework in which events are thought of as primitive
(i.e. as not further analysable), events in these generalised
frameworks are characterised as <em>processes</em> with associated
inputs and outputs. Specifically, one characterises quantum events
using a concept from quantum computation and information theory called
a <em>quantum channel</em>. And within this generalised
interventionist framework, causal models of quantum phenomena can be
given which do not need to posit non-local causal influences, and
which satisfy certain other desiderata typically required in a causal
model (in particular that such a model respect the causal Markov
condition and that it not require &lsquo;fine-tuning&rsquo;; see
Shrapnel 2017).</p>

<h3 id="QuanCompPersPhysScie">5.4 (Quantum) Computational Perspectives on Physical Science</h3>

<p>
Physics is traditionally conceived as a primarily
&ldquo;theoretical&rdquo; activity, in the sense that it is generally
thought to be the goal of physics to tell us, even if only indirectly
(Fuchs 2002, pp. 5&ndash;6), what the world is like independently of
any considerations of purpose. This is not the case with every
science. Chemistry, for example, is arguably best thought of as a
&ldquo;practically&rdquo; oriented discipline concerned with the ways
in which systems can be manipulated for particular purposes
(Bensaude-Vincent 2009). Even within physics, there are
sub-disciplines which are best construed in this way (Ladyman 2018;
Myrvold 2011; Wallace 2014), and indeed some have even advocated that
physics should be reconceptualised as the science of possible and
impossible transformations (Deutsch 2013; Marletto 2022; Marletto et
al. 2022).</p>

<p>
Elaborating upon ideas which one can glean from Pitowsky&rsquo;s work
(1990, 1996, 2002), Cuffaro (2017, 2018a) argues that quantum
computation and information theory (QCIT) are practical sciences in
this sense, as opposed to the &ldquo;theoretical sciences&rdquo;
exemplified by physics under its traditional characterisation; further
that recognising this distinction illuminates both areas of activity.
On the one hand, practical investigators attempting to isolate and/or
quantify the computational resources made available by quantum
computers are in danger of conceptual confusion if they are not
cognisant of the differences between practical and traditional
sciences. On the other hand, one should be wary of the significance of
classical computer simulations of quantum mechanical phenomena for the
purposes of a foundational analysis of the latter. For example,
certain mathematical results can legitimately be thought of as no-go
theorems for the purposes of a traditional foundational analysis, and
yet are not really relevant for the purpose of characterising the
class of efficiently simulable quantum phenomena.</p>

<h3 id="ChurTuriThesDeutPrin">5.5 The Church-Turing Thesis and Deutsch&rsquo;s Principle</h3>

<p>
The Church-Turing thesis, which asserts that every function naturally
regarded as computable is Turing-computable, is argued by Deutsch to
presuppose a physical principle, namely that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[DP]: Every finitely realisable physical system can be perfectly
simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite
means. (Deutsch 1985)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Since no machine operating by finite means can simulate classical
physics&rsquo; continuity of states and dynamics, Deutsch argues that
DP is false in a classical world. He argues that it is true for
quantum physics, however, owing to the existence of the universal
quantum Turing machine he introduces in the same paper, which thus
proves both DP and the Church-Turing thesis it underlies to be sound.
This idea&mdash;that the Church-Turing thesis requires a physical
grounding&mdash;is set into historical context by Lupacchini (2018),
who traces its roots in the thought of G&ouml;del, Post, and Gandy. It
is criticised by Timpson (2013), who views it as methodologically
fruitful, but as nevertheless resting on a confusion regarding the
meaning of the Church-Turing thesis, which in itself has to do with
the notion of an effective method and has nothing, per se, to do with
physics (cf. Sprevak 2022).</p>

<h3 id="QuanCompScieExpl">5.6 (Quantum) Computation and Scientific Explanation</h3>

<p>
In the general philosophy of science literature on
 <a href="../scientific-explanation/">scientific explanation</a>
 there is a distinction between so-called &ldquo;how-actually&rdquo;
and &ldquo;how-possibly&rdquo; explanation, where the former aims to
convey how a particular outcome actually came about, and the latter
aims to convey how the occurrence of an event can have been possible.
That how-actually explanation actually explains is uncontroversial,
but the merit (if any) of how-possibly explanation has been debated.
While some view how-possibly explanation as genuinely explanatory,
others have argued that how-possibly &lsquo;explanation&rsquo; is
better thought of as, at best, a merely heuristically useful
exercise.</p>

<p>
It turns out that the science of quantum computation is able to
illuminate this debate. Cuffaro (2015) argues that when one examines
the question of the source of quantum speed-up, one sees that to
answer this question is to compare algorithmic processes of various
kinds, and in so doing to describe the possibility spaces associated
with these processes. By doing so one explains how it is possible for
one process to outperform its rival. Further, Cuffaro argues that in
examples like this, once one has answered the how-possibly question,
nothing is actually gained by subsequently asking a how-actually
question.</p>

<h3 id="TherCompKind">5.7 Are There Computational Kinds?</h3>

<p>
Finally, another philosophical implication of the realisation of a
large scale quantum computer regards the long-standing debate in the
philosophy of mind on the autonomy of computational theories of the
mind (Fodor 1974). In the shift from strong to weak artificial
intelligence, the advocates of this view tried to impose constraints
on computer programs before they could qualify as theories of
cognitive science (Pylyshyn 1984). These constraints include, for
example, the nature of physical realisations of symbols and the
relations between abstract symbolic computations and the physical
causal processes that execute them. The search for the computational
feature of these theories, i.e., for what makes them
<em>computational</em> theories of the mind, involved isolating some
features of the computer <em>as such</em>. In other words, the
advocates of weak AI were looking for computational properties, or
kinds, that would be <em>machine independent</em>, at least in the
sense that they would not be associated with the physical constitution
of the computer, nor with the specific machine model that was being
used. These features were thought to be instrumental in debates within
cognitive science, e.g., the debates surrounding functionalism (Fodor
&amp; Pylyshyn 1988).</p>

<p>
Note, however, that once the physical Church-Turing thesis is
violated, arguably some computational notions cease to be autonomous.
In other words, given that quantum computers may be able to
efficiently solve classically intractable problems, hence re-describe
the abstract space of computational complexity (Bernstein &amp;
Vazirani 1997), computational concepts and even computational kinds
such as &lsquo;an efficient algorithm&rsquo; or &lsquo;the class
NP&rsquo;, arguably become machine-dependent, and recourse to
&lsquo;hardware&rsquo; becomes inevitable in any analysis thereof
(Cuffaro 2018b; Hagar 2007). Advances in quantum computing may thus
militate against the functionalist view about the <em>unphysical</em>
character of the types and properties that are used in computer
science. Consequently, efficient quantum algorithms may serve as
counterexamples to a-priori arguments against reductionism (Pitowsky
1996)&mdash;although the conceptual challenges to the physicalist
version of that view would also seem to be non-trivial (Brown
2023).</p>
